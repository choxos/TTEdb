37131279,"Target trial emulation has drastically improved the quality of observational  studies investigating the effects of interventions. Its ability to prevent avoidable biases that have plagued many observational analyses has contributed to its recent popularity. This review explains what target trial emulation is, why it should be the standard approach for causal observational studies that investigate interventions, and how to do a target trial emulation analysis. We discuss the merits of target trial emulation compared with often used, but biased analyses, as well as potential caveats, and provide clinicians and researchers with the tools to better interpret results from observational studies investigating the effects of interventions.","Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.",00001751-202308000-00005 [pii]; JASN-2023-000583 [pii]; 10.1681/ASN.0000000000000152 [doi],Fu EL,ORCID: 0000-0002-9698-6825,"Copyright © 2023 The Author.

36740144,"BACKGROUND: Multiple mAbs are currently approved for the treatment of asthma.  However, there is limited evidence on their comparative effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of omalizumab, mepolizumab, and dupilumab in individuals with moderate-to-severe asthma. METHODS: We emulated a hypothetical randomized trial using electronic health records from a large US-based academic health care system. Participants aged 18 years or older with baseline IgE levels between 30 and 700 IU/mL and peripheral eosinophil counts of at least 150 cells/μL were eligible for study inclusion. The study period extended from March 2016 to August 2021. Outcomes included the incidence of asthma-related exacerbations and change in baseline FEV(1) value over 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: In all, 68 individuals receiving dupilumab, 68 receiving omalizumab, and 65 receiving mepolizumab met the inclusion criteria. Over 12 months of follow-up, 31 exacerbations occurred over 68 person years (0.46 exacerbations per person year) in the dupilumab group, 63 over 68 person years (0.93 per person year) in the omalizumab group, and 86 over 65 person years (1.32 per person year) in the mepolizumab group (adjusted incidence rate ratios: dupilumab vs mepolizumab, 0.28 [95% CI = 0.09-0.84]; dupilumab vs omalizumab, 0.36 [95% CI = 0.12-1.09]; and omalizumab vs mepolizumab, 0.78 [95% CI = 0.32-1.91]). The differences in the change in FEV(1) comparing patients who received the different biologics were as follows: 0.11 L (95% CI = -0.003 to 0.222 L) for dupilumab versus mepolizumab, 0.082 L (95% CI -0.040 to 0.204 L) for dupilumab versus omalizumab, and 0.026 L (95% CI -0.083 to 0.140 L) for omalizumab versus mepolizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with asthma and eosinophil counts of at least 150 cells/μL and IgE levels of 30 to 700 kU/L, dupilumab was associated with greater improvements in exacerbation and FEV(1) value than omalizumab and mepolizumab.","Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Brigham and Women's Hospital,  Boston, Mass; Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Mass; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Md.

38801776,"BACKGROUND: There is little consensus on using statins for primary prevention of  cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and all-cause mortality in adults aged 75 years or older due to the underrepresentation of this population in randomized controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the benefits and risks of using statins for primary prevention in old (aged 75 to 84 years) and very old (aged ≥85 years) adults. DESIGN: Sequential target trial emulation comparing matched cohorts initiating versus not initiating statin therapy. SETTING: Territory-wide public electronic medical records in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Persons aged 75 years or older who met indications for statin initiation from January 2008 to December 2015 were included. Participants with preexisting diagnosed CVDs at baseline, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), were excluded from the analysis. Among 69 981 eligible persons aged 75 to 84 years and 14 555 persons aged 85 years or older, 41 884 and 9457 had history of CHD equivalents (for example, diabetes) in the respective age groups. INTERVENTION: Initiation of statin therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of major CVDs (stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure), all-cause mortality, and major adverse events (myopathies and liver dysfunction). RESULTS: Of 42 680 matched person-trials aged 75 to 84 years and 5390 matched person-trials aged 85 years or older (average follow-up, 5.3 years), 9676 and 1600 of them developed CVDs in each age group, respectively. Risk reduction for overall CVD incidence was found for initiating statin therapy in adults aged 75 to 84 years (5-year standardized risk reduction, 1.20% [95% CI, 0.57% to 1.82%] in the intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis; 5.00% [CI, 1.11% to 8.89%] in the per protocol [PP] analysis) and in those aged 85 years or older (ITT: 4.44% [CI, 1.40% to 7.48%]; PP: 12.50% [CI, 4.33% to 20.66%]). No significantly increased risks for myopathies and liver dysfunction were found in both age groups. LIMITATION: Unmeasured confounders, such as lifestyle factors of diet and physical activity, may exist. CONCLUSION: Reduction for CVDs after statin therapy were seen in patients aged 75 years or older without increasing risks for severe adverse effects. Of note, the benefits and safety of statin therapy were consistently found in adults aged 85 years or older.

39159459,"BACKGROUND: For older adults with kidney failure who are not referred for  transplant, medical management is an alternative to dialysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare survival and home time between older adults who started dialysis at an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 12 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and those who continued medical management. DESIGN: Observational cohort study using target trial emulation. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2010 to 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years or older with chronic kidney failure and eGFR below 12 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who were not referred for transplant. INTERVENTION: Starting dialysis within 30 days versus continuing medical management. MEASUREMENTS: Mean survival and number of days at home. RESULTS: Among 20 440 adults (mean age, 77.9 years [SD, 8.8]), the median time to dialysis start was 8.0 days in the group starting dialysis and 3.0 years in the group continuing medical management. Over a 3-year horizon, the group starting dialysis survived 770 days and the group continuing medical management survived 761 days (difference, 9.3 days [95% CI, -17.4 to 30.1 days]). Compared with the group continuing medical management, the group starting dialysis had 13.6 fewer days at home (CI, 7.7 to 20.5 fewer days at home). Compared with the group continuing medical management and forgoing dialysis completely, the group starting dialysis had longer survival by 77.6 days (CI, 62.8 to 91.1 days) and 14.7 fewer days at home (CI, 11.2 to 16.5 fewer days at home). LIMITATION: Potential for unmeasured confounding due to lack of symptom assessments at eligibility; limited generalizability to women and nonveterans. CONCLUSION: Older adults starting dialysis when their eGFR fell below 12 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who were not referred for transplant had modest gains in life expectancy and less time at home.

38745965,"BACKGROUND: The role of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the treatment  of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unconfirmed. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody/tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with or without TACE as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. METHODS: This nationwide, multicenter, retrospective cohort study included advanced HCC patients receiving either TACE with ICIs plus anti-VEGF antibody/TKIs (TACE-ICI-VEGF) or only ICIs plus anti-VEGF antibody/TKIs (ICI-VEGF) from January 2018 to December 2022. The study design followed the target trial emulation framework with stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (sIPTW) to minimize biases. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05332821. FINDINGS: Among 1244 patients included in the analysis, 802 (64.5%) patients received TACE-ICI-VEGF treatment, and 442 (35.5%) patients received ICI-VEGF treatment. The median follow-up time was 21.1 months and 20.6 months, respectively. Post-application of sIPTW, baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two groups. TACE-ICI-VEGF group exhibited a significantly improved median OS (22.6 months [95% CI: 21.2-23.9] vs 15.9 months [14.9-17.8]; P < 0.0001; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.63 [95% CI: 0.53-0.75]). Median PFS was also longer in TACE-ICI-VEGF group (9.9 months [9.1-10.6] vs 7.4 months [6.7-8.5]; P < 0.0001; aHR 0.74 [0.65-0.85]) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. A higher ORR was observed in TACE-ICI-VEGF group, by either RECIST v1.1 or modified RECIST (41.2% vs 22.9%, P < 0.0001; 47.3% vs 29.7%, P < 0.0001). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 178 patients (22.2%) in TACE-ICI-VEGF group and 80 patients (18.1%) in ICI-VEGF group. INTERPRETATION: This multicenter study supports the use of TACE combined with ICIs and anti-VEGF antibody/TKIs as first-line treatment for advanced HCC, demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.

39477370,"OBJECTIVE: To emulate target trials comparing recurrence of nephrolithiasis among  patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis (overall and stratified by concomitant gout) initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors versus an active comparator. DESIGN: Target trial emulation studies. SETTING: Canadian population database, January 2014 to June 2022. PARTICIPANTS: 20 146 patients with nephrolithiasis and type 2 diabetes, including those with concomitant gout at baseline, a high risk group. INTERVENTIONS: Initiation of an SGLT-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor as alternative comparator. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was recurrent nephrolithiasis events ascertained from diagnoses during emergency department visits, hospital admissions, or outpatient visits. Secondary outcomes included nephrolithiasis resulting in hospital admission or emergency department visits and flare-up of gout, as well as a positive control outcome (genital infection) and negative control outcomes (osteoarthritis encounter and appendicitis). Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used (primary analyses), as well as overlap weighting. RESULTS: After inverse probability of treatment weighting, 1924 recurrent nephrolithiasis events occurred among the 14 456 weighted patients who used an SGLT-2 inhibitor (105.3 per 1000 person years), compared with 853 events among the 5877 weighted patients who used a GLP-1 receptor agonist (156.4 per 1000 person years). The adjusted rate ratio was 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.79) and rate difference was -51 (95% CI -63 to -40) per 1000 person years, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 20. Among those with recently active nephrolithiasis, the absolute rate difference was 219 per 1000 person years (NNT of 5). Protective associations persisted for nephrolithiasis events that required emergency department visits, hospital admissions, or procedures, and when an SGLT-2 inhibitor was compared with a DPP-4 inhibitor (rate ratio 0.73 (0.68 to 0.78), rate difference -38 (-46 to -29) per 1000 person years (NNT of 26)). Protective associations also persisted among patients with nephrolithiasis and concomitant gout, with a rate ratio of 0.67 (0.57 to 0.79) and rate difference of -53 (95% CI -78 to -27) per 1000 person years versus a GLP-1 receptor agonist (NNT of 19), and 0.63 (0.55 to 0.72) and-62 (-81 to -42) per 1000 person years, respectively, versus a DPP-4 inhibitor (NNT of 16). Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with a lower rate of gout flare-ups (rate ratio 0.72, 0.54 to 0.95, rate difference -16, -31 to -1 per 1000 person years) compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists (0.65, 0.52 to 0.82, and -21, -33 to -9 per 1000 person years) compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. SGLT-2 inhibitor initiators showed higher risk of genital infection (eg, hazard ratio 2.21, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.90, and rate difference 13 per 1000 person years), but no altered risk of osteoarthritis encounter (0.87, 0.68 to 1.1, and -2 per 1000 person years) or appendicitis (1.07, 0.69 to 1.67, and 1 per 1000 person years). Results were similar when propensity score overlap weighting was applied. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor for patients with nephrolithiasis in these target trial emulations suggest they may be a useful addition to current treatments to simultaneously manage nephrolithiasis recurrence and comorbidities, including gout.","Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Division of  Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; The Mongan Institute, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Division of  Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; The Mongan Institute, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Diabetes Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British  Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of British Columbia,  Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Division of  Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; The Mongan Institute, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Division of  Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; The Mongan Institute, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Department of Epidemiology and  Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Neurosurgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore,  MD, USA.; Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine,  University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Division of Gerontology, Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of  Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and  Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Renal (Kidney) Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Division of  Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA hchoi@mgh.harvard.edu.; The Mongan Institute, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",bmj-2024-080035.R1 [pii]; mccn080035 [pii]; 10.1136/bmj-2024-080035 [doi],McCormick N; Yokose C; Lu N; Wexler DJ; Aviña-Zubieta JA; De Vera MA; Chigurupati S; Tan K; Chen C; McCoy R; Curhan GC; Choi HK,ORCID: 0000-0002-2862-0442,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

37562726,"OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the implementation of Target Trial Emulation  (TTE) for causal inference, involving research topics, frequently used strategies, and issues indicating the need for future improvements. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed a scoping review by following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. A health research-focused librarian searched multiple medical databases, and two independent reviewers completed screening and extraction within covidence review management software. RESULTS: Our search resulted in 1,240 papers, of which 96 papers were eligible for data extraction. Results show a significant increase in the use of TTE in 2018 and 2021. The study topics varied and focused primarily on cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. However, not all papers specified well all three critical components for generating robust causal evidence: time-zero, random assignment simulation, and comparison strategy. Some common issues were observed from retrieved papers, and key limitations include residual confounding, limited generalizability, and a lack of reporting guidance that need to be improved. CONCLUSION: Uneven adherence to the TTE framework exists, and future improvements are needed to progress applications using causal inference with observational data.","School of Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 1C9,  Canada.

37227368,"BACKGROUND: Metformin users appear to have a substantially lower risk of cancer  than nonusers in many observational studies. These inverse associations may be explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial. METHODS: We emulated target trials of metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. RESULTS: Among individuals with diabetes, the estimated 6-year risk differences (metformin - no metformin) were -0.2% (95% CI = -1.6%, 1.3%) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.0% (95% CI = -2.1%, 2.3%) in the per-protocol analysis. The corresponding estimates for all site-specific cancers were close to zero. Among individuals regardless of diabetes status, these estimates were also close to zero and more precise. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared strongly protective. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that metformin therapy does not meaningfully influence cancer incidence. The findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses.","From the CAUSALab, Harvard T.H.

39521399,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Despite a lack of supporting evidence, current guidance  recommends against the use of metformin in people with advanced kidney impairment. This observational study compared the outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes who continued versus stopped metformin after developing stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]<30mL/min/1.73m(2)). STUDY DESIGN: Nationwide observational cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adults with type 2 diabetes and incident stage 4 CKD in Scotland who were treated with metformin between January 2010 and April 2019. EXPOSURE: Stopping versus continuing metformin within 6 months following incident stage 4 CKD. OUTCOME: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Target trial emulation with clone-censor-weight design and marginal structural models fit for sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In a population of 371,742 Scottish residents with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes before April 30, 2019, 4,278 were identified as prevalent metformin users with incident CKD stage 4. Within 6 months of developing CKD stage IV, 1,713 (40.1%) individuals discontinued metformin. Compared with continuing metformin, stopping metformin was associated with a lower 3-year survival (63.7% [95% CI, 60.9-66.6] vs 70.5% [95% CI, 68.0-73.0]; HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.10-1.44]), and the incidence of MACE was similar between both strategies (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.88-1.26]). Marginal structural models confirmed the higher risk of all-cause mortality and similar risk of MACE in patients who stopped versus continued metformin (all-cause mortality: HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.08-1.67]; MACE: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.81-1.33]). LIMITATIONS: Residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: The continued use of metformin may be appropriate when eGFR falls below 30mL/min/1.73m(2). Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Current guidance recommends against the use of metformin in people with advanced kidney impairment despite a lack of evidence. It is therefore currently unclear how the decision to stop versus continue metformin in patients who reach stage 4 CKD impacts their risk of mortality and cardiovascular events. This study showed that stopping metformin after reaching stage 4 CKD was associated with reduced survival that did not appear to be mediated by an increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These findings may support the continued use of metformin in patients with advanced kidney impairment, but further research is needed to confirm these observations.","Division of Population Health and Genomics, School of Medicine, University of  Dundee, Dundee.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  the Netherlands.; Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh.; Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh.; Division of Population Health and Genomics, School of Medicine, University of  Dundee, Dundee.; Division of Population Health and Genomics, School of Medicine, University of  Dundee, Dundee.; School of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Health, College of Medical, Veterinary &  Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences,  University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh.; Division of Population Health and Genomics, School of Medicine, University of  Dundee, Dundee.

38946271,"OBJECTIVE: Antidepressants are commonly used to treat bipolar depression but may  increase the risk of mania. The evidence from randomized controlled trials, however, is limited by short treatment durations, providing little evidence for the long-term risk of antidepressant-induced mania. The authors performed a target trial emulation to compare the risk of mania among individuals with bipolar depression treated or not treated with antidepressants over a 1-year period. METHODS: The authors emulated a target trial using observational data from nationwide Danish health registers. The study included 979 individuals with bipolar depression recently discharged from a psychiatric ward. Of these, 358 individuals received antidepressant treatment, and 621 did not. The occurrence of mania and bipolar depression over the following year was ascertained, and the intention-to-treat effect of antidepressants was analyzed by using Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for baseline covariates to emulate randomized open-label treatment allocation. RESULTS: The fully adjusted analyses revealed no statistically significant associations between treatment with an antidepressant and the risk of mania in the full sample (hazard rate ratio=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.61), in the subsample concomitantly treated with a mood-stabilizing agent (hazard rate ratio=1.16, 95% CI=0.63-2.13), and in the subsample not treated with a mood-stabilizing agent (hazard rate ratio=1.16, 95% CI=0.65-2.07). Secondary analyses revealed no statistically significant association between treatment with an antidepressant and bipolar depression recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the risk of antidepressant-induced mania is negligible and call for further studies to optimize treatment strategies for individuals with bipolar depression.","Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University (Rohde, Østergaard, Jefsen),  and Department of Affective Disorders (Rohde, Østergaard, Jefsen) and Psychosis Research Unit (Jefsen), Aarhus University Hospital-Psychiatry, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University (Rohde, Østergaard, Jefsen),  and Department of Affective Disorders (Rohde, Østergaard, Jefsen) and Psychosis Research Unit (Jefsen), Aarhus University Hospital-Psychiatry, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University (Rohde, Østergaard, Jefsen),  and Department of Affective Disorders (Rohde, Østergaard, Jefsen) and Psychosis Research Unit (Jefsen), Aarhus University Hospital-Psychiatry, Aarhus, Denmark.",10.1176/appi.ajp.20230477 [doi],Rohde C; Østergaard SD; Jefsen OH,,,,,The authors report no financial relationships with commercial interests.,,2024/07/01 03:13,20240701,,2024 Jul 1,2024/07/01 06:42,,,"Rohde, Christopher; Østergaard, Søren Dinesen; Jefsen, Oskar Hougaard",,,7,,1535-7228,0002-953X,,0370512,The American journal of psychiatry,eng,10.1176/appi.ajp.20230477 [doi],20241010,Humans; *Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy; *Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Male; Female; Denmark/epidemiology; Adult; *Mania/chemically induced; Middle Aged; Registries; Proportional Hazards Models,2024/07/01 06:43,,,,Antidepressants; Bipolar and Related Disorders; Epidemiology; Mania; Pharmacotherapy; Target Trial Emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,630-638,,2024/07/01 03:13,2024/07/01 06:43,,,2024/07/01 06:42,,United States,,,ppublish,Journal Article; Observational Study,0 (Antidepressive Agents),IM,,Am J Psychiatry. 2024 Jul 1;181(7):630-638. doi: 10.1176/appi.ajp.20230477.,MEDLINE,Am J Psychiatry,A Nationwide Target Trial Emulation Assessing the Risk of Antidepressant-Induced  Mania Among Patients With Bipolar Depression.,,,,181
39074369,"BACKGROUND: Reports of reduced desire to smoke in patients treated with  semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, have raised interest about its potential benefit for tobacco use disorders (TUDs). OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of semaglutide with TUD-related health care measures in patients with comorbid T2DM and TUD. DESIGN: Emulation target trial based on a nationwide population-based database of patient electronic health records. SETTING: United States, 1 December 2017 to 31 March 2023. PARTICIPANTS: Seven target trials were emulated among eligible patients with comorbid T2DM and TUD by comparing the new use of semaglutide versus 7 other antidiabetes medications (insulins, metformin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and other GLP-1RAs). MEASUREMENTS: The TUD-related health care measures (medical encounter for diagnosis of TUD, smoking cessation medication prescriptions, and smoking cessation counseling) that occurred within a 12-month follow-up were examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: The study compared 222 942 new users of antidiabetes medications including 5967 of semaglutide. Semaglutide was associated with a significantly lower risk for medical encounters for TUD diagnosis compared with other antidiabetes medications, and was strongest compared with insulins (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.74]) and weakest but statistically significant compared with other GLP-1RAs (HR, 0.88 [CI, 0.81 to 0.96]). Semaglutide was associated with reduced smoking cessation medication prescriptions and counseling. Similar findings were observed in patients with and without a diagnosis of obesity. For most of the group comparisons, the differences occurred within 30 days of prescription initiation. LIMITATION: Documentation bias, residual confounding, missing data on current smoking behavior, body mass index, and medication adherence. CONCLUSION: Semaglutide was associated with lower risks for TUD-related health care measures in patients with comorbid T2DM and TUD compared with other antidiabetes medications including other GLP-1Ras, primarily within 30 days of prescription. These findings suggest the need for clinical trials to evaluate semaglutide's potential for TUD treatment.

38081829,"Target trial emulation is the process of mimicking target randomized trials using  real-world data, where effective confounding control for unbiased treatment effect estimation remains a main challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed for this challenge, a systematic evaluation is still lacking. Here we emulated trials for thousands of medications from two large-scale real-world data warehouses, covering over 10 years of clinical records for over 170 million patients, aiming to identify new indications of approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease. We assessed different propensity score models under the inverse probability of treatment weighting framework and suggested a model selection strategy for improved baseline covariate balancing. We also found that the deep learning-based propensity score model did not necessarily outperform logistic regression-based methods in covariate balancing. Finally, we highlighted five top-ranked drugs (pantoprazole, gabapentin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, and omeprazole) originally intended for other indications with potential benefits for Alzheimer's patients.","Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,  USA.; Institute of Artificial Intelligence for Digital Health, Weill Cornell Medicine,  New York, NY, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,  USA.; Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, University of Florida,  Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, University of Florida,  Gainesville, FL, USA.; Institude for Biomedical Informatics (IBI) and Department of Computer Science,  University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of  Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic,  Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine,  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of  Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Statistics, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (DBEI), the Perelman  School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of  Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Institude for Biomedical Informatics (IBI) and Department of Computer Science,  University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, University of Florida,  Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,  USA. few2001@med.cornell.edu.; Institute of Artificial Intelligence for Digital Health, Weill Cornell Medicine,  New York, NY, USA. few2001@med.cornell.edu.",10.1038/s41467-023-43929-1 [pii]; 43929 [pii]; 10.1038/s41467-023-43929-1 [doi],Zang C; Zhang H; Xu J; Zhang H; Fouladvand S; Havaldar S; Cheng F; Chen K; Chen Y; Glicksberg BS; Chen J; Bian J; Wang F,ORCID: 0000-0002-8244-9551; ORCID: 0000-0002-2928-2692; ORCID: 0000-0002-1736-2847; ORCID: 0000-0003-3579-5467; ORCID: 0000-0003-4515-8090; ORCID: 0000-0002-2238-5429; ORCID: 0000-0001-9459-9461,© 2023.

39863130,"OBJECTIVE: The administration of amiodarone or lidocaine is recommended during  the resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients presenting with defibrillation-refractory or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Our objective was to use 'target trial emulation' methodology to compare the outcomes of patients who received amiodarone or lidocaine during resuscitation. METHODS: Adult, non-traumatic OHCA patients in the ESO Data Collaborative 2018-2023 datasets who experienced OHCA prior to EMS arrival, presented with a shockable rhythm, and received amiodarone or lidocaine during resuscitation were evaluated for inclusion. We used propensity score matching (PSM) to investigate the association between antiarrhythmic and outcomes. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the number of post-drug defibrillations and survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: After application of exclusion criteria, 23,263 patients from 1,707 EMS agencies were eligible for analysis. Prior to PSM, 6,010/20,284 (29.6%) of the patients who received amiodarone and 1,071/2,979 (35.9%) of the patients who received lidocaine achieved prehospital ROSC. Following PSM, lidocaine administration was associated with greater odds of prehospital ROSC (36.0 vs. 30.4%; aOR: 1.29 [1.16, 1.44], n = 2,976 matched pairs). Lidocaine administration was also associated with fewer post-drug defibrillations (median: 2 [0-4] vs. 2 [0-6], mean: 3.3 vs. 3.9, p < 0.01, n = 2,976 pairs), and greater odds of survival to discharge (35.1 vs. 25.7%; OR: 1.54 [1.19, 2.00], n = 538 pairs). CONCLUSION: Our 'target trial emulation' suggested that lidocaine was associated with greater odds of prehospital ROSC in comparison to amiodarone when administered during resuscitation from shock refractory or recurrent VF/VT.","West Virginia University School of Medicine MD/PhD Program, Morgantown, WV,  United States.

38156911,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis evaluated  the efficacy and safety of hydrocortisone combined with fludrocortisone or hydrocortisone alone, compared with placebo in adult patients with septic shock. DATA SOURCES: By extending a prior Cochrane review, databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov , along with other relevant websites, were searched until August 31, 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies using target trial emulation were included. DATA EXTRACTION: The primary outcome was short-term mortality with an emphasis on 28- or 30-day mortality as the main measure and in-hospital or ICU mortality as the nearest surrogate of this measure. Three of the most common adverse events, namely, gastroduodenal bleeding, superinfection, and hyperglycemia, were also considered. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 19 studies involving 95,841 patients were included. Hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone showed the lowest short-term mortality versus placebo (odds ratio [OR]: 0.79; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.64-0.99; number needed to treat [NNT]: 21, range: 12-500; low certainty of evidence) in terms of informative priors. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve values for hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone alone, and placebo were 0.9469, 0.4542, and 0.0989, respectively. Consistent results were observed in RCTs alone and those using a daily 200-mg dose of hydrocortisone. Although gastroduodenal bleeding or superinfection showed no clear increase, hyperglycemia risk increased. The ORs were 0.53 for placebo versus hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone and 0.64 for placebo versus hydrocortisone alone, with very low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with septic shock, hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone improved short-term survival with minimal adverse events compared with hydrocortisone alone or placebo. However, these findings are not definitive due to the limited certainty of evidence and wide NNT range. Additional large-scale, placebo-controlled RCTs are needed to provide conclusive evidence.","Education Center, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Education Center, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Surgery, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National  Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, Nashville, TN.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Surgery, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.",00003246-202404000-00024 [pii]; 10.1097/CCM.0000000000006161 [doi],Lai PC; Lai CH; Lai EC; Huang YT,,"Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

39961105,"When randomized trials are not available to answer a causal question about the  comparative effectiveness or safety of interventions, causal inferences are drawn using observational data. A helpful 2-step framework for causal inference from observational data is 1) specifying the protocol of the hypothetical randomized pragmatic trial that would answer the causal question of interest (the target trial), and 2) using the observational data to attempt to emulate that trial. The target trial framework can improve the quality of observational analyses by preventing some common biases. In this article, we discuss the utility and scope of applications of the framework. We clarify that target trial emulation resolves problems related to incorrect design but not those related to data limitations. We also describe some settings in which adopting this approach is advantageous to generate effect estimates that can close the gaps that randomized trials have not filled. In these settings, the target trial framework helps reduce the ambiguity of causal questions.","CAUSALab, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

40311676,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, real-world data and observational  studies played an important role in assessing treatment effectiveness. Methodological challenges such as confounding, immortal time bias, and competing risks were observed. Target trial emulation provides a structured framework for evaluating treatment effectiveness using observational data while mitigating these biases. OBJECTIVES: To describe common biases in observational COVID-19 research, introduce the target trial emulation framework, and discuss how these biases can be addressed in this framework. Specifically, we discuss the clone-censor-weight approach and provide real-world study examples demonstrating its application in COVID-19 research. SOURCES: We summarise key principles of target trial emulation and the clone-censor-weight approach using published methodological articles. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical implementation by reviewing three studies that emulated a target trial to evaluate the effects of treatments in patients with COVID-19. These studies were selected without a predefined search strategy. CONTENT: We define and discuss confounding, immortal time bias, and competing risks in studies using observational data. To facilitate the understanding of these biases, we use a hypothetical example evaluating the effects of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We provide an overview of the target trial emulation framework and its core elements, explaining how it can mitigate these challenges. To illustrate the clone-censor-weight approach, we describe published examples demonstrating its application during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: Target trial emulation is an important framework for evaluating treatment effects using observational data, but it requires careful implementation to mitigate methodological biases. Identifying and addressing confounding, immortal time bias, and competing risks during study design and analysis are important in any causal study evaluating treatment effects. This framework can improve the quality of observational studies and complement evidence from clinical trials, particularly when evidence is urgently needed, as during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical  Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  The Netherlands.; Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical  Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.

36608311,"PURPOSE: To apply target trial emulation to explore the potential impact of  eligibility criteria on the primary outcome of a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Simulations of a real-world explanatory trial of transarterial radioembolization for advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion were performed to examine the effects of cohort specification on survival outcomes and patient sample size. Simulations comprised 24 different permutations of the trial varied on three disease nonspecific eligibility parameters. Treatment and control arms for these emulated trials were drawn from the National Cancer Database and matched by treatment propensity. Target trial emulation served as the causal framework for this analysis, allowing the architecture of a true controlled experiment to address forms of bias routinely encountered in comparative effectiveness studies involving real-world observational data. RESULTS: Twenty-four propensity score-matched cohorts comprising a wider clinical spectrum of patients than specified by the original target trial were successfully generated using the National Cancer Database. The arms for each of the emulated trials demonstrated exchangeability across all eligibility criteria and other clinical covariates. Significant treatment benefits were associated with only a narrow range of eligibility criteria, indicating that the original target trial was well specified. CONCLUSION: The impact of patient selection on treatment outcomes can be studied using target trial emulation. This analytical framework can furthermore serve to leverage existing real-world data to inform the task of cohort specification for a randomized controlled trial, facilitating a more data-driven approach for this important step in clinical trial design.","The Queen's Medical Center, Honolulu, HI.; University of Hawai`i Cancer Center, Clinical and Translational Sciences Program,  University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI.; University of Hawai`i Cancer Center, Clinical and Translational Sciences Program,  University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI.; Department of Surgery, The John A.

39374529,"Target trial emulation is an approach to designing rigorous nonexperimental  studies by ""emulating"" key features of a clinical trial. Most commonly used outside of policy contexts, this approach is also valuable for policy evaluation as policies typically are not randomly assigned. In this article, we discuss the application of the target trial emulation framework in a policy evaluation context. The policy trial emulation framework includes 7 components: the units and eligibility criteria, definitions of the exposure and comparison conditions, assignment mechanism, baseline (""time zero"") and follow-up, outcomes, causal estimand, and statistical analysis and assumptions. Policy evaluations that emulate a randomized trial across these dimensions can yield estimates of the causal effects of the policy on outcomes. Using the policy trial emulation framework to conduct and report on research design and methods supports transparent assessment of threats to causal inference in nonexperimental studies intended to assess the effect of a health policy on clinical or population health outcomes.","Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of  Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland; and Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (N.J.S.).; Division of Health Policy and Economics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New  York (E.E.M.).; Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  Baltimore, Maryland (E.A.S.).",10.7326/M23-2440 [doi],Seewald NJ; McGinty EE; Stuart EA,ORCID: 0000-0002-8367-0522; ORCID: 0009-0003-5095-9308; ORCID: 0000-0002-9042-8611,,,,Disclosures: Disclosures can be viewed at  www.acponline.org/authors/icmje/ConflictOfInterestForms.do?msNum=M23-2440.,,2024/10/07 17:03,20241118,20241008,2024 Nov,2024/10/07 19:17,,,"Seewald, Nicholas J; McGinty, Emma E; Stuart, Elizabeth A",,P50 MH115842/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States; R01 DA049789/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States,11,,1539-3704,0003-4819,0003-4819,0372351,Annals of internal medicine,eng,10.7326/M23-2440 [doi],20250502,Humans; *Health Policy; *Research Design; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,2024/11/18 18:22,NIHMS2028581,,,,,NLM,1530-1538,,2024/10/07 17:03,2024/11/18 18:22,,2025/05/01 00:00,2024/10/07 19:17,,United States,PMC11817613,2025/05/01,ppublish,Journal Article,,IM,,Ann Intern Med. 2024 Nov;177(11):1530-1538. doi: 10.7326/M23-2440.

40659022,"Conducting randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in rare paediatric diseases is  often impractical or prohibitively expensive. Observational data from longitudinal cohort studies, disease registries, and population-based databases exist for children and adolescents, but standard observational analyses are typically limited by bias. Target trial emulation methods can improve the quality of observational analysis, address common sources of bias, and help fill evidence gaps in paediatric clinical practice. Applying target trial emulation methods in paediatric research creates unique opportunities, but also poses specific challenges. Tailored approaches are needed to address issues with small sample size, treatment-effect heterogeneity, longitudinal follow-up, and missing data. This Review aims to outline key concepts, such as what causal inference and target trial emulation are, justify the use of target trial emulation methods in paediatric observational research, discuss approaches to emulating key elements of an RCT protocol, and highlight unique paediatric applications of target trial emulation.","Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada;  Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; SickKids Research Institute, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada.

38109485,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies are used for estimating vaccine effectiveness  under real-world conditions. The practical performance of two common approaches-cohort and test-negative designs-need to be compared for COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: We compared the cohort and test-negative designs to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19 outcomes using nationwide data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Specifically, we (1) explicitly emulated a target trial using follow-up data and evaluated the potential for confounding using negative controls and benchmarking to a randomized trial, (2) performed case-control sampling of the cohort to confirm empirically that the same estimate is obtained, (3) further restricted the sampling to person-days with a test, and (4) implemented additional features of a test-negative design. We also compared their performance in limited datasets. RESULTS: Estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness was similar under all four designs. Empirical results suggested limited residual confounding by healthcare-seeking behavior. Analyses in limited datasets showed evidence of residual confounding, with estimates biased downward in the cohort design and upward in the test-negative design. CONCLUSION: Vaccine effectiveness estimates under a cohort design with explicit target trial emulation and a test-negative design were similar when using rich information from the VA healthcare system, but diverged in opposite directions when using a limited dataset. In settings like ours with sufficient information on confounders and other key variables, the cohort design with explicit target trial emulation may be preferable as a principled approach that allows estimation of absolute risks and facilitates interpretation of effect estimates.","From the CAUSALab, Harvard T.H.

38730306,"PURPOSE: Invasive ventilation is a fundamental treatment in intensive care but  its precise timing is difficult to determine. This study aims at assessing the effect of initiating invasive ventilation versus waiting, in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure without immediate reason for intubation on one-year mortality. METHODS: Emulation of a target trial to estimate the benefit of immediately initiating invasive ventilation in hypoxemic respiratory failure, versus waiting, among patients within the first 48-h of hypoxemia. The eligible population included non-intubated patients with SpO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 200 and SpO(2) ≤ 97%. The target trial was emulated using a single-center database (MIMIC-IV) which contains granular information about clinical status. The hourly probability to receive mechanical ventilation was continuously estimated. The hazard ratios for the primary outcome, one-year mortality, and the secondary outcome, 30-day mortality, were estimated using weighted Cox models with stabilized inverse probability weights used to adjust for measured confounding. RESULTS: 2996 Patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of whom 792 were intubated within 48 h. Among the non-invasive support devices, the use of oxygen through facemask was the most common (75%). Compared to patients with the same probability of intubation but who were not intubated, intubation decreased the hazard of dying for the first year after ICU admission HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.68-0.96, p = 0.018). Intubation was associated with a 30-day mortality HR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.64-0.99, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The initiation of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure reduced the hazard of dying in this emulation of a target trial.","Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.  rmellado@clinic.cat.; CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), Instituto de Salud Carlos III,  Madrid, Spain. rmellado@clinic.cat.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona,  Spain. rmellado@clinic.cat.; Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute,  St Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. rmellado@clinic.cat.; Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada.; Division of Respirology, Department of Medicine, University Health Network and  Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada.; Division of Respirology, Department of Medicine, University Health Network and  Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada.; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Scarborough Health Network, Toronto, ON,  Canada.; MIT IMES: Massachussetts Institute of Technology Institute for Medical  Engineering and Science, Cambridge, USA.; Department of Breast Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson  Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.; Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), Instituto de Salud Carlos III,  Madrid, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona,  Spain.; CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), Instituto de Salud Carlos III,  Madrid, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona,  Spain.; Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, Pneumology, Respiratory Institute, Hospital  Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), Instituto de Salud Carlos III,  Madrid, Spain.; Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona,  Spain.; Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute,  St Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada.",10.1186/s13054-024-04926-y [pii]; 4926 [pii]; 10.1186/s13054-024-04926-y [doi],Mellado-Artigas R; Borrat X; Ferreyro BL; Yarnell C; Hao S; Wanis KN; Barbeta E; Torres A; Ferrando C; Brochard L,ORCID: 0000-0003-2815-6819,© 2024.

38862178,"The past decade has seen a substantial increase in the number of randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard method for generating robust evidence of drug safety and efficacy but are expensive, time-consuming, and may have ethical implications. Observational studies in IBD are often used to fill the gaps in evidence but are typically hindered by significant bias. There are several approaches for making statistical inferences from observational data with some that focus on study design and others on statistical techniques. Target trial emulation is an emerging methodological process that aims to bridge this gap and improve the quality of observational studies by applying the principles of an ideal, or ""target,"" randomized trial to routinely collected clinical data. There has been a rapid expansion of observational studies that have emulated trials over the past 5 years in other medical fields, but this has yet to be adopted in gastroenterology and IBD. The wealth of nonrandomized clinical data available through electronic health records, patient registries, and administrative health databases afford innumerable hypothesis-generating opportunities for IBD research. This review outlines the principles of target trial emulation, discusses the merits to IBD observational studies in reducing the most common biases and improving confidence in causality, and details the caveats of using this approach.","INFINY Institute, Nancy University Hospital, F-54500 Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France.; School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation  Trust, London, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital,  Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, 20132 Milan, Italy.; INFINY Institute, Nancy University Hospital, F-54500 Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France.; Department of Gastroenterology, Nancy University Hospital, F-54500  Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France.; INSERM, NGERE, University of Lorraine, F-54000 Nancy, France.; FHU-CURE, Nancy University Hospital, F-54500 Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France.; Groupe Hospitalier privé Ambroise Paré - Hartmann, Paris IBD Center, 92200  Neuilly sur Seine, France.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, McGill University Health Centre,  Montreal, Quebec, Canada.",7691250 [pii]; izae131 [pii]; 10.1093/ibd/izae131 [doi],Honap S; Danese S; Peyrin-Biroulet L,ORCID: 0000-0001-6657-2763; ORCID: 0000-0001-7341-1351,© 2024 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

39532374,"OBJECTIVES: Target trial emulation is an approach that is increasingly used to  improve transparency in observational studies and help mitigate biases. For studies declaring that they emulated a target trial, we aimed to evaluate the specification of the target trial, examine its consistency with the observational emulation and assess the risk of bias in the observational analysis. DESIGN: Methodological systematic review reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. DATA SOURCES: The database MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) was interrogated for all studies published from 1 January 2021 to 3 July 2022. We performed an additional manual search of 20 general medical and specialised journals that spanned the same period. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All studies that declared emulating a hypothetical or real randomised trial were eligible. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers performed the whole systematic review process (screening and selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment). The main outcomes were the definition of the key protocol components of the target trial and its emulation, consistency between the target trial and its emulation and risk of bias according to the ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) tool. RESULTS: Among the selected sample of 100 studies, 24 (24%) did not specify the target trial. Only 40 studies (40%) provided detailed information on all components of the target trial protocol. Eligibility criteria, intervention strategies and outcomes were consistent between the target trial and its emulation in 35 studies (46% of those specifying the target trial). Overall, 28 studies (28%) exhibited serious risk of bias and 41 (41%) had misalignments in the timing of eligibility assessment, treatment assignment and the start of follow-up (time-zero). As compared with studies that did not specify the target trial, those that did specify the trial less frequently seemed to have both time-zero issues (39% vs 52%) and serious risk of bias (26% vs 33%). CONCLUSIONS: One-quarter of studies declaring that they emulated a target trial did not specify the trial. Target trials and their emulations were particularly inconsistent for studies emulating a real randomised trial. Risk of methodological issues seemed lower in observational analyses that specified versus did not specify the target trial.","Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Gustave Roussy, Oncostat U1018, Inserm,  University Paris-Saclay, labeled Ligue Contre le Cancer, Villejuif, France simon.noemie@ymail.com.; Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidémiologie et de Santé  Publique, Equipe PEPITES, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Département de Santé Publique, Paris, France.; Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidémiologie et de Santé  Publique, Equipe PEPITES, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Département de Santé Publique, Paris, France.; Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidémiologie et de Santé  Publique, Equipe PEPITES, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Département de Santé Publique, Paris, France.; Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidémiologie et de Santé  Publique, Equipe PEPITES, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Département de Santé Publique, Paris, France.; Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidémiologie et de Santé  Publique, Equipe PEPITES, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Département de Santé Publique, Paris, France.; Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidémiologie et de Santé  Publique, Equipe PEPITES, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Département de Santé Publique, Paris, France.; Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidémiologie et de Santé  Publique, Equipe PEPITES, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Département de Santé Publique, Paris, France.",bmjopen-2024-086595 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjopen-2024-086595 [doi],Simon-Tillaux N; Martin GL; Hajage D; Scheifer C; Beydon M; Dechartres A; Tubach F,ORCID: 0000-0001-7138-5364,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

40493225,"PURPOSE: Sodium bicarbonate is commonly administered to treat metabolic acidosis  in intensive care units (ICUs). There is limited evidence from randomized trials to support this practice, and observational studies show conflicting results. Our aim was to perform a target trial emulation evaluating the effect of bicarbonate therapy on mortality. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using data from 12 Australian ICUs. Inclusion criteria were adults with pH < 7.3 and PCO(2) ≤ 45 mmHg within the first three days. We excluded repeat admissions, toxicology, diabetic ketoacidosis, and pre-existing end-stage renal failure. The treatment intervention was sodium-bicarbonate administration, and the primary outcome was 30-day ICU mortality with ICU discharge as a competing event. We evaluated multiple subgroups, including patients with acute kidney injury, requirement for vasoactive therapy, and pH < 7.2. The primary model utilized a parametric g-computation and rolling entry matching was performed as a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We identified 6157 eligible admissions, of which 1764 (29%) received sodium bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy was associated with a 1.9% absolute mortality reduction for the primary analysis [risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 0.91], and significant benefits were seen across all subgroups evaluated. A similar point estimate of 2.1% was observed in the sensitivity analysis, with a sustained mortality reduction seen at 30 days. CONCLUSION: In this target trial emulation, bicarbonate administration was associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in mortality for patients with metabolic acidosis. Large sample sizes would be required to demonstrate this effect in a randomized trial.","Intensive Care Unit, Cairns Hospital, Cairns, Australia.; Department of Anaesthesia, Cairns Hospital, Cairns, Australia.; Intensive Care Services, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Australia.; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health, Queensland University of Technology,  Brisbane, Australia.; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health, Queensland University of Technology,  Brisbane, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Redcliffe Hospital, Redcliffe, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, Mayne Academy of Critical Care, University of Queensland, St  Lucia, Australia.; Adult Intensive Care Services, The Prince Charles Hospital, Chermside, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Logan Hospital, Logan, Australia.; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health, Queensland University of Technology,  Brisbane, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, Mayne Academy of Critical Care, University of Queensland, St  Lucia, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospital, Coopers Plains,  Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, Mayne Academy of Critical Care, University of Queensland, St  Lucia, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Rockhampton Hospital, The Range, Australia.; Intensive Care Services, Mackay Base Hospital, Mackay, Australia.; College of Medicine and Dentistry, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Townsville Hospital, Townsville, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Sunshine Coast University Hospital, Birtinya, Australia.; School of Medicine and Dentistry, Griffith University, Mount Gravatt, Australia.; School of Medicine and Dentistry, Griffith University, Mount Gravatt, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Gold Coast University Hospital, Southport, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Cairns Hospital, Cairns, Australia.; Intensive Care Services, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Australia.

39836177,"Rationale: In critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation,  switching from controlled to assisted ventilation is a crucial milestone toward ventilator liberation. The optimal timing for switching to assisted ventilation has not been studied. Objectives: Our objective was to determine whether a strategy of early compared with delayed switching affects the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and mortality. Methods: We conducted a target trial emulation using the prospective, global WEAN SAFE (the WorldwidE AssessmeNt of Separation of pAtients From ventilatory assistancE) dataset. Patients were eligible for switching if they were still on controlled mechanical ventilation, were not receiving neuromuscular blockers, and had Pa(O(2)):Fi(O(2)) ratios >150 mm Hg. We compared an ""early switching"" strategy (switch within 1 day after reaching switching eligibility criteria) with a ""delayed switching"" strategy (switch 1 or more days after reaching the switching eligibility criteria). The primary outcome was the 28-day cumulative incidence of successful extubation. Secondary outcomes included 28-day and 90-day ICU discharge and ICU mortality. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,489 patients met the switching eligibility criteria. The early-switch group had, on average, 4 additional days of being successfully extubated over the 28-day period (95% confidence interval [CI], 3-6 days; P < 0.001) compared with the delayed group, with a higher difference in cumulative incidence of successful extubation at Day 28 (7% [95% CI, 0-13%]; P = 0.04). Early switching was associated with an 11% higher cumulative incidence of ICU discharge at Day 28 (95% CI, 7-18%; P < 0.001) and an average of 7 additional days discharged from the ICU over the 90-day period (95% CI, 4-12 days; P < 0.001) compared with delayed switching. ICU mortality rates did not differ between the strategies. Conclusions: Early switching from controlled to assisted ventilation is associated with shorter duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU stay compared with delayed switching.","Department of Intensive Care, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Intensive Care, Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the  Netherlands.; Department of Intensive Care, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, New York.; Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel  Hill, North Carolina.; Center for Medical Sciences, CISMed, University of Trento, Trento, Italy.; Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Santa Chiara Hospital, APSS Trento,  Trento, Italy.; Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences  Institute, Galway University Hospitals, University of Galway, Galway, Ireland.; Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute,  St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Service de Médecine Intensive-Réanimation, Hôpital de Bicêtre, DMU CORREVE, FHU  SEPSIS, Groupe de Recherche Clinique CARMAS, Université Paris-Saclay, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.; Université Paris-Saclay, Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines,  University Paris-Sud, Inserm U1018, Equipe d'Epidémiologie Respiratoire Intégrative, Centre de Recherche en Epidémiologie et Santé des Populations, Villejuif, France; and.; Department of Intensive Care, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the  Netherlands.",10.1164/rccm.202406-1162OC [doi],Reep CAT; Wils EJ; Fleuren LM; Breskin A; Bellani G; Laffey JG; Brochard LJ; Pham T; Heunks L,ORCID: 0000-0002-9408-7324; ORCID: 0000-0002-2868-0920; ORCID: 0000-0002-4056-1692; ORCID: 0000-0001-5568-2510; ORCID: 0000-0002-3089-205X; ORCID: 0000-0002-1246-9573; ORCID: 0000-0002-7456-906X; ORCID: 0000-0002-4373-0711; ORCID: 0000-0003-3196-4665,,Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2025 Jun;211(6):895-897. doi:  10.1164/rccm.202501-0240ED.

39008852,"BACKGROUND: A major concern has recently emerged about a potential link between  glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and increased risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors based on International Classification of Diseases codes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between GLP-1 RAs, compared with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is), and risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN: Two target trial emulation studies comparing propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts for GLP-1 RAs versus SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs versus DPP4is. SETTING: U.S. national Medicare administrative data from January 2017 to December 2020. PATIENTS: Older adults (≥66 years) with T2D; no record of suicidal ideation or behaviors; and a first prescription for a GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i, or DPP4i. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was a composite of suicidal ideation and behaviors. New GLP-1 RA users were matched 1:1 on PS to new users of an SGLT2i or DPP4i in each pairwise comparison. A Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CIs within matched groups. RESULTS: This study included 21 807 pairs of patients treated with a GLP-1 RA versus an SGLT2i and 21 402 pairs of patients treated with a GLP-1 RA versus a DPP4i. The HR of suicidal ideation and behaviors associated with GLP-1 RAs relative to SGLT2is was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.45; rate difference, 0.16 [CI, -0.53 to 0.86] per 1000 person-years); the HR relative to DPP4is was 0.94 (CI, 0.71 to 1.24; rate difference, -0.18 [CI, -0.92 to 0.57] per 1000 person-years). LIMITATIONS: Low event rate; imprecise estimates; unmeasured confounders, such as body mass index; and potential misclassification of outcomes. CONCLUSION: Among Medicare beneficiaries with T2D, this study found no clear increased risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors with GLP-1 RAs, although estimates were imprecise and a modest adverse risk could not be ruled out.

Individuals aged 45-79 years diagnosed with colorectal polyps 2006-2016 in Sweden without CRC or contraindications for preventive aspirin (cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, aortic aneurysms, pulmonary emboli, myocardial infarction, gastric ulcer, dementia, liver cirrhosis, or any other metastatic cancer) registered until the month of first polyp detection were eligible. Using duplication and inverse probability weighting, we emulated a target trial of aspirin initiation within 2 years of initial polyp detection. The main outcome measures were incident CRC, CRC mortality and all-cause mortality registered until 2019. RESULTS: Of 31,633 individuals meeting our inclusion criteria, 1716 (5%) initiated aspirin within 2 years of colon polyp diagnosis. Median follow-up was 8.07 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence in initiators versus non-initiators was 6% versus 8% for CRC incidence, 1% versus 1% for CRC mortality and 21% versus 18% for all-cause mortality. The corresponding hazard ratios were 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 95%CI = 0.86-0.90), 0.90 (95%CI = 0.75-1.06) and 1.18 (95%CI = 1.12-1.24). CONCLUSION: Aspirin initiation in individuals with polyp removal was linked to 2% lower cumulative incidence of CRC after 10 years but did not alter CRC mortality. We also observed a 4% increased risk difference of all-cause mortality at 10 years after the initiation of aspirin.","Department of General Practice, Institute of Health and Society, University of  Oslo, Oslo, Norway. louise.emilsson@medisin.uio.no.; Vårdcentralen Värmlands Nysäter and Centre for Clinical Research, County Council  of Värmland, Värmland, Sweden. louise.emilsson@medisin.uio.no.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Solna, Sweden. louise.emilsson@medisin.uio.no.; Faculty of Medicine and Health, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.  louise.emilsson@medisin.uio.no.; Departments of Epidemiology and Nutrition, Harvard T.H.

36983933,"Methodological biases are common in observational studies evaluating treatment  effectiveness. The objective of this study is to emulate a target trial in a competing risks setting using hospital-based observational data. We extend established methodology accounting for immortal time bias and time-fixed confounding biases to a setting where no survival information beyond hospital discharge is available: a condition common to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) research data. This exemplary study includes a cohort of 618 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We describe methodological opportunities and challenges that cannot be overcome applying traditional statistical methods. We demonstrate the practical implementation of this trial emulation approach via clone-censor-weight techniques. We undertake a competing risk analysis, reporting the cause-specific cumulative hazards and cumulative incidence probabilities. Our analysis demonstrates that a target trial emulation framework can be extended to account for competing risks in COVID-19 hospital studies. In our analysis, we avoid immortal time bias, time-fixed confounding bias, and competing risks bias simultaneously. Choosing the length of the grace period is justified from a clinical perspective and has an important advantage in ensuring reliable results. This extended trial emulation with the competing risk analysis enables an unbiased estimation of treatment effects, along with the ability to interpret the effectiveness of treatment on all clinically important outcomes.","Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical  Centre, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.; Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical  Centre, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.; Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical  Centre, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.; Biomedical Engineering Department, Engineering Faculty, University of Isfahan,  Isfahan 81746-73441, Iran.; Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department  (ESAII), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC) Building H, Floor 4, Av.

39761590,"BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients have high rates of fracture morbidity, but evidence  on optimal management strategies for osteoporosis is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for cardiovascular events and fracture prevention effects with denosumab compared with oral bisphosphonates in dialysis-dependent patients. DESIGN: An observational study that attempts to emulate a target trial. SETTING: A Japanese administrative claims database (April 2014 to October 2022). PATIENTS: Adults aged 50 years or older who have initiated denosumab or oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in dialysis-dependent patients. MEASUREMENTS: The safety outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The effectiveness outcome was a composite of all fractures. Follow-up was 3 years. RESULTS: A total of 1032 patients were identified (658 denosumab users and 374 oral bisphosphonate users). Overall average age was 74.5 years, and 62.9% were women. The weighted 3-year risk difference for MACE was 8.2% (95% CI, -0.2% to 16.7%), with a weighted 3-year risk ratio of 1.36 (CI, 0.99 to 1.87). The weighted 3-year risk difference for composite fractures was -5.3% (CI, -11.3% to -0.6%), and the weighted 3-year risk ratio was 0.55 (CI, 0.28 to 0.93). LIMITATIONS: Lack of clinical data on kidney or osteoporosis disease severity and cardiovascular or other metabolic risk with residual confounding. Safety outcomes did not include kidney end points. CONCLUSION: It was estimated that, compared with oral bisphosphonates, denosumab lowered the risk for fractures by 45% and increased the risk for MACE by 36%. The estimates, however, are imprecise and need to be confirmed in future studies.

39556837,"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on treatment of osteoporosis in patients  with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk for emergently treated hypocalcemia with denosumab by stage of CKD and presence of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). DESIGN: Target trial emulation. SETTING: Medicare fee-for-service data with prescription drug coverage, 2012 to 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Female patients aged 65 years or older initiating denosumab, oral bisphosphonates, or intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates for osteoporosis. MEASUREMENTS: Hospital and emergency department admissions (that is, emergent care) for hypocalcemia were assessed in the first 12 treatment weeks. Inverse probability of treatment weighted cumulative incidence and weighted risk differences (RDs) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 361 453 patients treated with denosumab, 829 044 treated with oral bisphosphonates, and 160 413 treated with IV bisphosphonates were identified. Risk for emergently treated hypocalcemia with denosumab versus oral bisphosphonates increased with worsening CKD stage (P < 0.001), with greatest risk among dialysis-dependent (DD) patients (3.01% vs. 0.00%; RD, 3.01% [95% CI, 2.27% to 3.77%]) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 (0.57% vs. 0.03%; RD, 0.54% [CI, 0.41% to 0.68%]). Among patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD (NDD + DD), denosumab had a greater risk for emergently treated hypocalcemia versus oral bisphosphonates in those with CKD-MBD (1.53% vs. 0.02%; RD, 1.51% [CI, 1.21% to 1.78%]) than in those without CKD-MBD (0.22% vs. 0.03%; RD, 0.19% [CI, 0.08% to 0.31%]). Denosumab also showed increased risk compared with IV bisphosphonates. LIMITATION: Generalizability to men and non-Medicare populations. CONCLUSION: Risk for emergently treated hypocalcemia with denosumab increased with worsening CKD stage and was highest in DD patients and those with CKD-MBD.

39025098,"BACKGROUND: Remdesivir (Veklury, Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA) and  nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) were reported to improve the outcome of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Preclinical data suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir might be more effective than remdesivir alone or in combination with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for people at high risk of severe COVID-19. We aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of combining remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared with using each drug alone for adults hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS: In this target trial emulation study, we used electronic health records of patients aged 18 years or older who received either combination treatment of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir or monotherapy of either drug between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, within 5 days of hospitalisation for COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline patient characteristics across the treatment groups. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting weighting was used to compare the risk of all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or ventilatory support for 90 days of follow-up between groups. FINDINGS: Between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, 18 196 participants were identified from electronic health records and assigned to receive remdesivir (n=4232), nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=13 656), or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir (n=308). By applying an inverse probability of treatment weighting, a weighted sample composed of 18 410 recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination treatment, 18 178 recipients of remdesivir monotherapy, and 18 287 recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was obtained. After a median follow-up of 84 days (IQR 45-90), risk of mortality was lower in patients who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0·18 [95% CI 0·15 to 0·20]; absolute risk reduction [ARR] -16·33% [95% CI -16·98 to -15·68]) or remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir combination therapy (HR 0·66 [95% CI 0·49 to 0·89]; ARR -6·52% [95% CI -7·29 to -5·74]) than in patients who received remdesivir monotherapy. Similar results were observed for ICU admission or ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy: HR 0·09 [95% CI 0·07 to 0·11]; ARR -10·04% [95% CI -10·53 to -9·56]; combination therapy: HR 0·68 [95% CI 0·42 to 1·12]; ARR -3·24% [95% CI -3·84 to -2·64]). Compared with combination therapy, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was associated with lower risk of mortality (HR 0·27 [95% CI 0·20 to 0·37]; ARR -9·81% [95% CI -10·39 to -9·24]) and ICU admission or ventilatory support (HR 0·13 [95% CI 0·08 to 0·22]; ARR -6·80% [95% CI -7·22 to -6·39]). INTERPRETATION: Our study highlighted the potential for reduced risk of mortality, ICU admission, or the need for ventilatory support in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir as a monotherapy compared with treatment regimens based on nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination therapy or remdesivir monotherapy. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to support the validity of the current results. FUNDING: The Health and Medical Research Fund Commissioned Research on COVID-19.

39250921,"BACKGROUND: Islet transplantation has been associated with better metabolic  control and quality of life than insulin treatment alone, but direct evidence of its effect on hard clinical endpoints is scarce. We aimed to assess the effect of islet transplantation on patient-graft survival in kidney transplant recipients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled all patients with type 1 diabetes who received a kidney graft in France during the study period, identified from the CRISTAL nationwide registry. Non-inclusion criteria included recipients from transplant centres that never proposed islet transplantation during the study period, recipients with a functional pancreas throughout the follow-up duration, recipients with more than two kidney transplants, HLA-sensitised recipients, recipients with less than 1 year of follow-up after kidney transplantation, misclassified recipients with type 2 diabetes, recipients aged over 65 years, recipients of kidney grafts from Donation after Circulatory Death donors, recipient with HIV or hepatitis, recipients with cancer, and recipients of combined liver-kidney transplants. Patients who also received islet-after-kidney (IAK) transplantation were compared with controls who received kidney transplantation alone according to a 1:2 matching method based on time-dependent propensity scores, ensuring patients comparability at the time of islet transplantation. The primary outcome was patient-graft survival, a composite outcome defined by death, re-transplantation, or return to dialysis. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017, 2391 patients with type 1 diabetes were identified as having received a kidney transplant, 47 patients of whom also received an islet transplantation. 2002 patients were not eligible for islet transplantation and 62 were excluded due to missing data. 327 eligible recipients from 15 centres were included in the study dataset for the target trial emulation. 40 patients who received IAK transplantation were successfully matched to 80 patients who received kidney transplantation alone. 13 (33%) of 40 patients in the IAK transplantation group returned to dialysis or died, compared with 36 (45%) of 80 patients in the kidney transplantation alone group. We found a significant benefit of islet transplantation compared with kidney transplantation alone on patient-graft survival, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·44 (95% CI 0·23-0·88; p=0·022), mainly explained by a protective effect on the risk of death (HR 0·41, 0·13-0·91; p=0·042). There was no meaningful association between IAK and death-censored graft survival (0·73, 0·30-1·89; p=0·36). INTERPRETATION: In kidney transplant recipients with type 1 diabetes, IAK transplantation was associated with a significantly better patient-graft survival compared with kidney transplantation alone, mainly due to a protective effect on the risk of death. These results potentially serve as compelling grounds for advocating wider access to islet transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing kidney transplant, as reimbursement of islet transplantation is provided in few countries worldwide.

38684099,"BACKGROUND: No studies have reported the long-term outcomes of initiating  sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to predialysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk for dialysis, cardiovascular events, and death between SGLT2i users and nonusers in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN: Target trial emulation study. SETTING: Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). PARTICIPANTS: By applying sequential target trial emulation principle, 23 854 SGLT2i users and 23 892 SGLT2i nonusers were selected from the NHIRD for patients with T2D and stage 5 CKD from 1 May 2016 to 31 October 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Conditional Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risks for dialysis, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute kidney injury (AKI), and all-cause mortality between SGLT2i users and nonusers. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat model, compared with no SGLT2i use, SGLT2i use was associated with lower risks for dialysis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34 [95% CI, 0.27 to 0.43]), hospitalization for heart failure (HR, 0.80 [CI, 0.73 to 0.86]), AMI (HR, 0.61 [CI, 0.52 to 0.73]), DKA (HR, 0.78 [CI, 0.71 to 0.85]), and AKI (HR, 0.80 [CI, 0.70 to 0.90]), but there was no difference in the risk for all-cause mortality (HR, 1.11 [CI, 0.99 to 1.24]). The Kaplan-Meier curves and subgroup analyses also showed that initiation of an SGLT2i in stage 5 CKD was associated with a lower risk for long-term dialysis than no SGLT2i use. LIMITATION: This result may not apply to patients without T2D. CONCLUSION: This emulated target trial showed that SGLT2i use was associated with a lower risk for dialysis, cardiovascular events, DKA, and AKI than no SGLT2i use in patients with T2D and stage 5 CKD.

39159770,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the ability of two new comorbidity indices to adjust for  confounding, by benchmarking a target trial emulation against the randomized controlled trial (RCT) result. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study including 18,316 men from Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 5.0, diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2008 and 2019 and treated with primary radical prostatectomy (RP, n = 14,379) or radiotherapy (RT, n = 3,937). The effect on adjusted risk of death from any cause after adjustment for comorbidity by use of two new comorbidity indices, the multidimensional diagnosis-based comorbidity index and the drug comorbidity index, were compared to adjustment for the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). RESULTS: Risk of death was higher after RT than RP (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70-2.21). The difference decreased when adjusting for age, cancer characteristics, and CCI (HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06-1.66). Adjustment for the two new comorbidity indices further attenuated the difference (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91-1.44). Emulation of a hypothetical pragmatic trial where also older men with any type of baseline comorbidity were included, largely confirmed these results (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.95-1.26). CONCLUSION: Adjustment for comorbidity using two new indices provided comparable risk of death from any cause in line with results of a RCT. Similar results were seen in a broader study population, more representative of clinical practice.","Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

37660025,"BACKGROUND: Real-world observational data are an important source of evidence on  the treatment effectiveness for patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, observational studies evaluating treatment effectiveness based on longitudinal data are often prone to methodological biases such as immortal time bias, confounding bias, and competing risks. METHODS: For exemplary target trial emulation, we used a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 501) in a single centre. We described the methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a single-dose treatment, emulated a trial using real-world data, and drafted a hypothetical study protocol describing the main components. To avoid immortal time and time-fixed confounding biases, we applied the clone-censor-weight technique. We set a 5-day grace period as a period of time when treatment could be initiated. We used the inverse probability of censoring weights to account for the selection bias introduced by artificial censoring. To estimate the treatment effects, we took the multi-state model approach. We considered a multi-state model with five states. The primary endpoint was defined as clinical severity status, assessed by a 5-point ordinal scale on day 30. Differences between the treatment group and standard of care treatment group were calculated using a proportional odds model and shown as odds ratios. Additionally, the weighted cause-specific hazards and transition probabilities for each treatment arm were presented. RESULTS: Our study demonstrates that trial emulation with a multi-state model analysis is a suitable approach to address observational data limitations, evaluate treatment effects on clinically heterogeneous in-hospital death and discharge alive endpoints, and consider the intermediate state of admission to ICU. The multi-state model analysis allows us to summarize results using stacked probability plots that make it easier to interpret results. CONCLUSIONS: Extending the emulated target trial approach to multi-state model analysis complements treatment effectiveness analysis by gaining information on competing events. Combining two methodologies offers an option to address immortal time bias, confounding bias, and competing risk events. This methodological approach can provide additional insight for decision-making, particularly when data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are unavailable.","Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical  Centre, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. oksana.martinuka@uniklinik-freiburg.de.; Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical  Centre, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department  (ESAII), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain.; Inequalities in Cancer Outcomes Network (ICON), Department of Non-Communicable  Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department  (ESAII), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Health, Isfahan  University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.; Department of Internal Medicine, Bellvitge University Hospital, Bellvitge  Biomedical Research Institute-IDIBELL, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical  Centre, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.",10.1186/s12874-023-02001-8 [pii]; 2001 [pii]; 10.1186/s12874-023-02001-8 [doi],Martinuka O; Hazard D; Marateb HR; Maringe C; Mansourian M; Rubio-Rivas M; Wolkewitz M,ORCID: 0000-0003-0874-7670; ORCID: 0000-0001-7874-7567; ORCID: 0000-0003-4408-2397; ORCID: 0000-0002-8739-9565; ORCID: 0000-0002-7217-0282; ORCID: 0000-0002-1268-5057,"© 2023.

36972033,"IMPORTANCE: Patients with septic shock may benefit from the initiation of  corticosteroids. However, the comparative effectiveness of the 2 most studied corticosteroid regimens (hydrocortisone with fludrocortisone vs hydrocortisone alone) is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of adding fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone vs hydrocortisone alone among patients with septic shock using target trial emulation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study from 2016 to 2020 used the enhanced claims-based Premier Healthcare Database, which included approximately 25% of US hospitalizations. Participants were adult patients hospitalized with septic shock and receiving norepinephrine who began hydrocortisone treatment. Data analysis was performed from May 2022 to December 2022. EXPOSURE: Addition of fludrocortisone on the same calendar day that hydrocortisone treatment was initiated vs use of hydrocortisone alone. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Composite of hospital death or discharge to hospice. Adjusted risk differences were calculated using doubly robust targeted maximum likelihood estimation. RESULTS: Analyses included 88 275 patients, 2280 who began treatment with hydrocortisone-fludrocortisone (median [IQR] age, 64 [54-73] years; 1041 female; 1239 male) and 85 995 (median [IQR] age, 67 [57-76] years; 42 136 female; 43 859 male) who began treatment with hydrocortisone alone. The primary composite outcome of death in hospital or discharge to hospice occurred among 1076 (47.2%) patients treated with hydrocortisone-fludrocortisone vs 43 669 (50.8%) treated with hydrocortisone alone (adjusted absolute risk difference, -3.7%; 95% CI, -4.2% to -3.1%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness cohort study among adult patients with septic shock who began hydrocortisone treatment, the addition of fludrocortisone was superior to hydrocortisone alone.","The Pulmonary Center, Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine,  Department of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto,  Ontario.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Ontario.; The Pulmonary Center, Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine,  Department of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Pulmonary Center, Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine,  Department of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Section of Rheumatology, Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of  Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Pulmonary Center, Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine,  Department of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.",2802801 [pii]; ioi230008 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.0258 [doi],Bosch NA; Teja B; Law AC; Pang B; Jafarzadeh SR; Walkey AJ,,,JAMA Intern Med. 2023 May 1;183(5):460-461. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.0257.

37994775,"Ideally, causal research questions will be answered with randomized trials, but  this is not always feasible for practical, ethical, or methodological reasons. To obtain a reliable answer to causal questions with observational data, target trial emulation has been introduced, in which an observational study is designed, conducted, and analyzed emulating the target trial. After phrasing a causal question, this framework first addresses seven components of the target trial protocol: eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, assignment procedures, follow-up period, outcome of interest, causal contrast of interest, and statistical analysis plan. Subsequently, these elements are emulated in the observational study. This approach addresses methodological pitfalls before initiating the study, draws more unambiguous conclusions, and provides a structured assessment of limitations of observational studies as well as randomized trials. The use of the target trial framework to support the design of observational studies is increasing.","Radboudumc, afd.

39173703,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between preconception 25-hydroxyvitamin D  (25(OH)D) levels and biomarkers in female and male partners on live birth (LB), pregnancy loss, and semen quality. DESIGN: Secondary analysis using the folic acid and zinc supplementation trial of couples seeking infertility treatment at four US centers (2013-2017). A target trial emulation framework was applied to estimate associations. Couples were observed for 9 months or through pregnancy. SUBJECTS: Couples seeking infertility treatment. INTERVENTION(S): Preconception concentrations of 25(OH)D (primary) and associated biomarkers: vitamin D binding protein, calcium, free vitamin D, bioavailable vitamin D. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Live birth and pregnancy loss were ascertained via self-report and medical records. Semen quality was ascertained 6 months after enrollment. Log-binomial regression estimated risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Individual and joint models and effect measure modification by preconception body mass index were considered. RESULT(S): Among 2,370 couples, 19.5% of females and 29.9% of males were 25(OH)D deficient. Females with sufficient status had a 28%-higher likelihood of LB than deficient females (95% CI, 1.05-1.56). Female and male 25(OH)D status were associated with LB among those with normal body mass index (sufficient vs. deficient: female adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00-1.99; male aRR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.25) and among obese female partners (sufficient vs. deficient: aRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.95-1.85). Couples whose both partners had higher 25(OH)D status had increased likelihood of LB (both not deficient vs. both deficient aRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00-1.58). No associations were observed with pregnancy loss or semen quality. Similar results were found for all biomarkers except calcium. CONCLUSION(S): Preconception vitamin D status and bioavailability impact fertility among couples seeking infertility therapy, likely unrelated to semen quality. Body mass index stratified analyses demonstrated heterogeneous associations.

37220893,"BACKGROUND: Real-world data studies usually consider biases related to measured  confounders. We emulate a target trial implementing study design principles of randomized trials to observational studies; controlling biases related to selection, especially immortal time; and measured confounders. METHODS: This comprehensive analysis emulating a randomized clinical trial compared overall survival in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC), receiving as first-line treatment, either paclitaxel alone or combined to bevacizumab. We used data from 5538 patients extracted from the Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics-MBC cohort to emulate a target trial using advanced statistical adjustment techniques including stabilized inverse-probability weighting and G-computation, dealing with missing data with multiple imputation, and performing a quantitative bias analysis for residual bias due to unmeasured confounders. RESULTS: Emulation led to 3211 eligible patients, and overall survival estimates achieved with advanced statistical methods favored the combination therapy. Real-world effect sizes were close to that assessed in the existing E2100 randomized clinical trial (hazard ratio = 0.88, P = .16), but the increased sample size allowed to achieve a higher level of precision in real-world estimates (ie, reduced confidence intervals). Quantitative bias analysis confirmed the robustness of the results with respect to potential unmeasured confounding. CONCLUSION: Target trial emulation with advanced statistical adjustment techniques is a promising approach to investigate long-term impact of innovative therapies in the French Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics-MBC cohort while minimizing biases and provides opportunities for comparative efficacy through the synthetic control arms provided.

36509514,"Target trial emulation (TTE) applies the principles of randomized controlled  trials to the causal analysis of observational data sets. One challenge that is rarely considered in TTE is the sources of bias that may arise if the variables involved in the definition of eligibility for the trial are missing. We highlight patterns of bias that might arise when estimating the causal effect of a point exposure when restricting the target trial to individuals with complete eligibility data. Simulations consider realistic scenarios where the variables affecting eligibility modify the causal effect of the exposure and are missing at random or missing not at random. We discuss means to address these patterns of bias, namely: 1) controlling for the collider bias induced by the missing data on eligibility, and 2) imputing the missing values of the eligibility variables prior to selection into the target trial. Results are compared with the results when TTE is performed ignoring the impact of missing eligibility.

39937060,"Target trial emulation (TTE) is an observational, quasi-experimental research  design that emulates a randomized clinical trial (RCT) structure within a large set of observational data; the ""target trial"" is a hypothetical RCT that would have ideally answered the research question. TTEs can address study objectives that, for ethical or logistic reasons, cannot easily be examined in RCTs. Advantages of TTEs over conventional approaches to observational data are that TTEs can reduce bias, improve the understanding of findings, and facilitate causal inference. This article explains what TTEs are, how TTEs are performed, and how TTEs differ from observational studies, quasi controlled studies, and RCTs. Prevalent user bias and immortal time bias are explained, as is how TTEs are designed to avoid these biases. Strengths and limitations of TTEs are discussed. This article also presents 2 recent studies: one, comprising 3 TTEs that examined scholastic outcomes in children gestationally exposed to benzodiazepines and z-drugs in different periods during pregnancy; and the other, a TTE that examined manic switch as an outcome in bipolar depression patients who received antidepressant treatment. The TTEs found that early, mid, or late pregnancy exposure to benzodiazepines or z-drugs was not associated with impairment in fifth-grade numeracy and literacy performance; and that, in patients with bipolar depression, antidepressant drugs (with or without concurrent mood stabilizers) did not increase the 1-year risk of hypomania, mania, or mixed episodes, nor did they reduce the risk of recurrence of bipolar depression. The TTEs that yielded these results had limitations, and so these findings are suggestive, not definitive. As a general conclusion, TTEs may be viewed as pragmatic, naturalistic, real-world emulations of RCTs, with some advantages over conventional observational studies, but they cannot drive causal inference.","Department of Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher  Education, Manipal, India; Department of Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neurotoxicology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, India (andradec@gmail.com).",25f15796 [pii]; 10.4088/JCP.25f15796 [doi],Andrade C,,"© Copyright 2025 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.",,,,,2025/02/12 09:33,20250507,20250212,2025 Feb 12,2025/02/12 12:27,,,"Andrade, Chittaranjan",,,1,,1555-2101,0160-6689,,7801243,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,eng,25f15796 [pii]; 10.4088/JCP.25f15796 [doi],20250507,Humans; Female; Pregnancy; *Research Design; Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy; *Observational Studies as Topic/methods; *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods; Benzodiazepines/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use/adverse effects,2025/02/12 12:28,,,,,,NLM,,,2025/02/12 09:33,2025/02/12 12:28,,,2025/02/12 12:27,,United States,,,epublish,Journal Article,12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines); 0 (Antidepressive Agents),IM,,J Clin Psychiatry. 2025 Feb 12;86(1):25f15796. doi: 10.4088/JCP.25f15796.,MEDLINE,J Clin Psychiatry,Target Trial Emulation: A Concept Simply Explained.,,,,86
40360520,"Corticosteroids decrease the duration of organ dysfunction in sepsis and a range  of overlapping and complementary infectious critical illnesses, including septic shock, pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The risk and benefit of corticosteroids are not fully defined using the construct of organ dysfunction duration. This retrospective multicenter, proof-of-concept study aimed to evaluate the association between usage of corticosteroids and mortality of patients with sepsis, pneumonia and ARDS by emulating a target trial framework stratified by predicted organ dysfunction trajectory. The study employed a two staged machine learning (ML) methodology to first subphenotype based on organ dysfunction trajectory then predict this defined trajectory. Once patients were classified by predicted trajectory we conducted a target trial emulation. Our analysis revealed that the association between corticosteroid use and 28-day mortality varied by predicted trajectory and between cohorts.Our findings suggest that matching treatment strategies to empirically observed pathobiology may offer a more nuanced understanding of corticosteroid utility.","Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine Program, Cornell University,  Cornell, NY, USA.; Division of Health Informatics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Health Informatics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Health Informatics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, New  York-Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; First Department of Critical Care Medicine and Pulmonary Services, Evangelismos  Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, New  York-Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine,  University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, School of Medicine, Indiana  University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.; Regenstrief Institute, Indianapolis, IN, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, New  York-Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. ejs9005@med.cornell.edu.; Division of Health Informatics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. few2001@med.cornell.edu.",10.1038/s41467-025-59643-z [pii]; 59643 [pii]; 10.1038/s41467-025-59643-z [doi],Rajendran S; Xu Z; Pan W; Zang C; Siempos I; Torres L; Xu J; Bian J; Schenck EJ; Wang F,ORCID: 0000-0002-8149-0157; ORCID: 0000-0002-8244-9551; ORCID: 0000-0001-5291-5198; ORCID: 0000-0002-2238-5429; ORCID: 0000-0002-7950-5989; ORCID: 0000-0001-9459-9461,© 2025.

32381560,"OBJECTIVES: Target trial emulation is an intuitive design framework that  encourages investigators to formulate their comparative effectiveness research (CER) question as a hypothetical randomised controlled trial (RCT). Our aim was to systematically review CER studies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to provide examples of design limitations that could be avoided using target trial emulation, and how these limitations might introduce bias. METHODS: We searched for head-to-head CER studies of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in RA. Study designs were reviewed for seven components of the target trial emulation framework: eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, assignment procedures, follow-up period, outcome, causal contrasts of interest (ie, intention-to-treat (ITT) or per-protocol effect) and analysis plan. Hypothetical trials corresponding to the reported methods were assessed to identify design limitations that would have been avoided with an explicit target trial protocol. Analysis of the primary effectiveness outcome was chosen where multiple analyses were performed. RESULTS: We found 31 CER studies, of which 29 (94%) had at least one design limitation belonging to seven components. The most common limitations related to: (1) eligibility criteria: 19/31 (61%) studies used post-baseline information to define baseline eligibility; (2) causal contrasts: 25 (81%) did not define whether ITT or per-protocol effects were estimated and (3) assignment procedures: 13 (42%) studies did not account for confounding by indication or relied solely on statistical confounder selection. CONCLUSIONS: Design limitations were found in 94% of observational CER studies in RA. Target trial emulation is a structured approach for designing observational CER studies that helps to avoid potential sources of bias.","Musculoskeletal Biology, Institute of Lifecourse and Medical Sciences, University  of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK s.zhao8@liverpool.ac.uk.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Orthopaedics, General Hospital of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women's  Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.",S0003-4967(24)01322-0 [pii]; 10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217200 [doi],Zhao SS; Lyu H; Solomon DH; Yoshida K,ORCID: 0000-0002-3558-7353; ORCID: 0000-0002-0128-0062; ORCID: 0000-0002-2030-3549,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

39467290,"BACKGROUND: Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin are the most widely prescribed  moderate- to high-intensity statins. However, evidence on their efficacy and safety during actual use is limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare the real-world effectiveness and safety of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. DESIGN: Active comparator cohort study using target trial emulation. SETTING: The China Renal Data System (CRDS) and UK Biobank (UKB) databases. PARTICIPANTS: Adults newly prescribed rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used after 1:1 multilevel propensity score matching. RESULTS: Among the 285 680 eligible participants in both databases, 6-year all-cause mortality was lower for rosuvastatin than for atorvastatin (2.57 vs. 2.83 per 100 person-years in the CRDS database and 0.66 vs. 0.90 per 100 person-years in the UKB database), with differences in cumulative incidence of -1.03% (95% CI, -1.44% to -0.46%) in the CRDS database and -1.38% (CI, -2.50% to -0.21%) in the UKB database. For secondary outcomes in both databases, rosuvastatin conferred lower risks for major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse liver outcomes. In the UKB database, the risk for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher with rosuvastatin, and the 2 medications carried similar risks for development of chronic kidney disease and other statin-related adverse effects. LIMITATION: Possible residual confounding. CONCLUSION: This study found differences in risks for some important outcomes associated with rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. The differences were relatively small, and many did not meet traditional standards for statistical significance. Further research is needed to understand whether these findings can be used with confidence in clinical practice.

39497563,"BACKGROUND: Despite the proven effectiveness of oral antivirals against severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in randomized trials, their clinical reevaluation is vital in the context of widespread immunity and milder prevalent variants. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of oral antivirals for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized a target trial emulation framework to analyze patients with COVID-19 aged 60+ from January to December 2022. Data were obtained from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The study involved 957,036 patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 243,360 treated with molnupiravir, each compared with the matched control groups. Primary outcome was progression to critical COVID-19 requiring advanced respiratory support. Secondary outcomes included progression to severe COVID-19, need for supplemental oxygen, and death within 30 days of the onset of COVID-19. Number needed to treat (NNT) derived from the absolute risk reduction. RESULTS: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was significantly associated with a reduced risk of severe (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.823; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.803-0.843), critical (aOR, 0.560; 95% CI, 0.503-0.624), and fatal COVID-19 (aOR, 0.694; 95% CI, 0.647-0.744). Similarly, molnupiravir reduced the risk of severe (aOR, 0.895; 95% CI, 0.856-0.937), critical (aOR, 0.672; 95% CI, 0.559-0.807), and fatal cases (aOR, 0.679; 95% CI, 0.592-0.779). NNTs for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were 203.71 (severe), 1,230.12 (critical), and 691.50 (death); for molnupiravir, they were 352.70 (severe), 1,398.62 (critical), and 862.98 (death). Higher effectiveness was associated with older adults, unvaccinated individuals, and the late pandemic phase. CONCLUSION: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir are effective in preventing progression to severe disease in elderly adults with COVID-19.","Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center,  Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Public Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of  Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA.; Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center,  Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine,  Incheon, Korea.; Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center,  Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.; Patient Management Team, Central Headquarters of COVID-19, Korea Disease Control  and Prevention Agency, Cheongju, Korea.; Division of Immunization, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, Cheongju,  Korea.; Patient Management Team, Central Headquarters of COVID-19, Korea Disease Control  and Prevention Agency, Cheongju, Korea.; Division of Clinical Research, Center for Emerging Virus Research, National  Institute of Infectious Disease, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, Cheongju, Korea.; Patient Management Team, Central Headquarters of COVID-19, Korea Disease Control  and Prevention Agency, Cheongju, Korea.; Patient Management Team, Central Headquarters of COVID-19, Korea Disease Control  and Prevention Agency, Cheongju, Korea.; Division of Public Health Emergency Response Research, Bureau of Public Health  Emergency Preparedness, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, Cheongju, Korea.; Big Data Management Division, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service,  Wonju, Korea.; Big Data Management Division, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service,  Wonju, Korea.; Big Data Management Division, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service,  Wonju, Korea.; Big Data Management Division, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service,  Wonju, Korea.; Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center,  Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine,  Incheon, Korea. eastside1st@gmail.com.",39.e272 [pii]; 10.3346/jkms.2024.39.e272 [doi],Huh K; Jo Y; Bae GH; Joo H; Radnaabaatar M; Lee H; Kim J; Kim DH; Yoo MG; Jo IU; Lee PH; Lee GW; Jung HS; Jung J,ORCID: 0000-0002-5140-3964; ORCID: 0000-0002-1440-2786; ORCID: 0000-0002-8736-3386; ORCID: 0000-0003-1683-1143; ORCID: 0000-0003-4968-5031; ORCID: 0000-0003-3478-3704; ORCID: 0000-0003-2732-1544; ORCID: 0000-0002-3181-0917; ORCID: 0000-0002-8153-6813; ORCID: 0009-0008-6160-9393; ORCID: 0000-0001-8258-2152; ORCID: 0000-0002-1459-1652; ORCID: 0009-0001-3226-4372; ORCID: 0000-0002-4856-3668,© 2024 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.,,,The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.,,2024/11/05 03:23,20241105,20241104,2024 Nov 4,2024/11/05 10:18,,,"Huh, Kyungmin; Jo, Youngji; Bae, Gi Hwan; Joo, Hyejin; Radnaabaatar, Munkhzul; Lee, Hyungmin; Kim, Jungyeon; Kim, Dong-Hwi; Yoo, Min-Gyu; Jo, Il Uk; Lee, Poong Hoon; Lee, Geun Woo; Jung, Hee Sun; Jung, Jaehun",,HD22C2045/KNIH/Korea National Institute of Health/Korea; NRF-2021R1A5A2030333/NRF/National Research Foundation of Korea/Korea,42,,1598-6357,1011-8934,1011-8934,8703518,Journal of Korean medical science,eng,10.3346/jkms.2024.39.e272 [doi]; e272,20241108,"Humans; *Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use; Male; Female; *COVID-19 Drug Treatment; Retrospective Studies; Aged; Republic of Korea; Middle Aged; *SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification; *Ritonavir/therapeutic use; Administration, Oral; COVID-19/mortality; Hydroxylamines/therapeutic use; Treatment Outcome; Aged, 80 and over; Cytidine/analogs & derivatives",2024/11/05 10:19,,,,COVID-19; Effectiveness; Oral Antivirals; SARS-CoV-2; Target Trial Emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,e272,2024/07/30 00:00,2024/11/05 03:23,2024/11/05 10:19,,2024/11/04 00:00,2024/11/05 10:18,2024/05/21 00:00,Korea (South),PMC11538573,2024/11/04,epublish,Journal Article,0 (Antiviral Agents); O3J8G9O825 (Ritonavir); YA84KI1VEW (molnupiravir); 0 (Hydroxylamines); 5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine),IM,,J Korean Med Sci. 2024 Nov 4;39(42):e272. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2024.39.e272.,MEDLINE,J Korean Med Sci,Nationwide Target Trial Emulation Evaluating the Clinical Effectiveness of Oral  Antivirals for COVID-19 in Korea.,,,,39
38769166,"PURPOSE: Carfilzomib, commonly used for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma  (RRMM), has been associated with various adverse events in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, real-world safety data for a more diverse population are needed, as carfilzomib received expedited approval. This study aimed to evaluate carfilzomib's safety in Korea by comparing new users of KRd (carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) to Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) using a nationwide administrative claims database. METHODS: The retrospective cohort study utilized target trial emulation, focusing on adverse events in various organ systems similar to the ASPIRE trial. RESULTS: This study included 4,580 RRMM patients between 2007 and 2020, and the KRd group showed significantly higher risks of hematologic adverse events (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and some non-hematologic adverse events (cough, hypokalemia, constipation, hypertension, heart failure) compared to the Rd group. Among non-hematologic adverse events, cardiovascular events (heart failure [HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.24-3.35], hypertension [HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.15-2.17]) had the highest risk in the KRd group. CONCLUSION: The safety profile of carfilzomib in Korean patients was similar to previous RCTs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using carfilzomib in Asian individuals with RRMM due to the increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events.","College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; College of Pharmacy, Gachon University, Incheon, Republic of Korea.; College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul  National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.  jmoh@snu.ac.kr.; College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul  National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. jmoh@snu.ac.kr.",10.1007/s00432-024-05800-8 [pii]; 5800 [pii]; 10.1007/s00432-024-05800-8 [doi],Lee HK; Jang HY; Kim IW; Oh JM,,© 2024.

38880437,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Controversy exists regarding potential cancer risks  associated with long-term statin use. This study aimed to use real-world data to investigate the association between cancer incidence and sustained statin use over a 10-year period. METHODS: Using territory-wide public electronic medical records in Hong Kong, we emulated a sequence of nested target trials on patients who met indications for statin initiation in each calendar month from January 2009 to December 2011. Statin initiators and noninitiators were matched in a 1:1 ratio to mimic the randomization of eligible person-trials at baseline. Pooled logistic regression was applied to obtain the hazard ratios for the cancer incidence of statin initiation in intention-to-treat analysis, with the adjustment of baseline confounders and the inverse probability weighting accounting for the postbaseline confounders in per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: Among 8,560,051 eligible person-trials, 119,715 noninitiators were matched to 119,715 initiators for analysis. Over the 10-year study period, the estimated hazard ratio of overall cancer incidence was 0.96 (0.87, 1.05), and the standardized 10-year risk difference was -0.4% (-1.3%, 0.4%) in the per-protocol analysis. For the cancer subtypes of interest (ie, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hematological cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, urothelial carcinoma, and lung cancer), the 10-year risk differences ranged from -0.3% to 0.2% in the per-protocol analysis. No observable risk change for cancer was found in all patient subgroups with regards to their sex, age (<70/≥70 years), Charlson Comorbidity Index (≤4/>4), and statin indication. CONCLUSION: Statin use has no impact on cancer incidence over a 10-year follow-up period, including all cancer subtypes of interest and patient subgroups with regards to sex, age, comorbidities, and statin indications.","Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; The Bau Institute of Medical and Health Sciences Education, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, The University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public  Health, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.; Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale  University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.

37792702,"Target trial emulation applies design principles from randomised controlled  trials to the analysis of observational data for causal inference and is increasingly used within human epidemiology. Veterinary electronic clinical records represent a potentially valuable source of information to estimate real-world causal effects for companion animal species. This study employed the target trial framework to evaluate the usefulness on veterinary observational data. Acute diarrhoea in dogs was used as a clinical exemplar. Inclusion required dogs aged ≥ 3 months and < 10 years, presenting for veterinary primary care with acute diarrhoea during 2019. Treatment strategies were: 1. antimicrobial prescription compared to no antimicrobial prescription and 2. gastrointestinal nutraceutical prescription compared to no gastrointestinal nutraceutical prescription. The primary outcome was clinical resolution (defined as no revisit with ongoing diarrhoea within 30 days from the date of first presentation). Informed from a directed acyclic graph, data on the following covariates were collected: age, breed, bodyweight, insurance status, comorbidities, vomiting, reduced appetite, haematochezia, pyrexia, duration, additional treatment prescription and veterinary group. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance covariates between the treatment groups for each of the two target trials. The risk difference (RD) of 0.4% (95% CI -4.5% to 5.3%) was non-significant for clinical resolution in dogs treated with antimicrobials compared with dogs not treated with antimicrobials. The risk difference (RD) of 0.3% (95% CI -4.5% to 5.0%) was non-significant for clinical resolution in dogs treated with gastrointestinal nutraceuticals compared with dogs not treated with gastrointestinal nutraceuticals. This study successfully applied the target trial framework to veterinary observational data. The findings show that antimicrobial or gastrointestinal prescription at first presentation of acute diarrhoea in dogs causes no difference in clinical resolution. The findings support the recommendation for veterinary professionals to limit antimicrobial use for acute diarrhoea in dogs.","Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield,  Herts, United Kingdom.; Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, United  Kingdom.; Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield,  Herts, United Kingdom.; Research Support Office, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Herts, United  Kingdom.; Clinical Sciences and Services, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Herts,  United Kingdom.; Willows Veterinary Centre & Referral Centre, Solihull, United Kingdom.; Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield,  Herts, United Kingdom.; Clinical Sciences and Services, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Herts,  United Kingdom.; Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield,  Herts, United Kingdom.",PONE-D-23-17538 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pone.0291057 [doi],Pegram C; Diaz-Ordaz K; Brodbelt DC; Chang YM; Tayler S; Allerton F; Prisk L; Church DB; O'Neill DG,ORCID: 0000-0002-8367-5294; ORCID: 0000-0003-1115-2723,"Copyright: © 2023 Pegram et al.

39075484,"BACKGROUND: The net benefit of aspirin cessation in older adults remains  uncertain. This study aimed to use observational data to emulate a randomized trial of aspirin cessation versus continuation in older adults without cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Post hoc analysis using a target trial emulation framework applied to the immediate post-trial period (2017-2021) of a study of low-dose aspirin initiation in adults aged ≥ 70 years (ASPREE; NCT01038583). Participants from Australia and the USA were included if they were free of CVD at the start of the post-trial intervention period (time zero, T0) and had been taking open-label or randomized aspirin immediately before T0. The two groups in the target trial were as follows: aspirin cessation (participants who were taking randomized aspirin immediately before T0; assumed to have stopped at T0 as instructed) versus aspirin continuation (participants on open-label aspirin at T0 regardless of their randomized treatment; assumed to have continued at T0). The outcomes after T0 were incident CVD, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), all-cause mortality, and major bleeding during 3, 6, and 12 months (short-term) and 48 months (long-term) follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) comparing aspirin cessation to continuation were estimated from propensity-score (PS) adjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTS: We included 6103 CVD-free participants (cessation: 5427, continuation: 676). Over both short- and long-term follow-up, aspirin cessation versus continuation was not associated with elevated risk of CVD, MACE, and all-cause mortality (HRs, at 3 and 48 months respectively, were 1.23 and 0.73 for CVD, 1.11 and 0.84 for MACE, and 0.23 and 0.79 for all-cause mortality, p > 0.05), but cessation had a reduced risk of incident major bleeding events (HRs at 3 and 48 months, 0.16 and 0.63, p < 0.05). Similar findings were seen for all outcomes at 6 and 12 months, except for a lowered risk of all-cause mortality in the cessation group at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that deprescribing prophylactic aspirin might be safe in healthy older adults with no known CVD.","School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS,  Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS,  Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, The University  of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA.; Department of Family Medicine, Carver College of Medicine, The University of  Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine Hennepin HealthCare, Berman Centre  for Outcomes and Clinical Research, Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, Minneapolis, MN, USA.; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.; Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; School of Population Health, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine Hennepin HealthCare, Berman Centre  for Outcomes and Clinical Research, Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, Minneapolis, MN, USA.; Department of Family & Preventive Medicine and the Rush Alzheimer's Disease  Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.; Discipline of General Practice, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia. rory.wolfe@monash.edu.",10.1186/s12916-024-03507-8 [pii]; 3507 [pii]; 10.1186/s12916-024-03507-8 [doi],Zhou Z; Webb KL; Nelson MR; Woods RL; Ernst ME; Murray AM; Chan AT; Tonkin A; Reid CM; Orchard SG; Kirpach B; Shah RC; Stocks N; Broder JC; Wolfe R,ORCID: 0000-0002-2126-1045,© 2024.

35332434,"Evidence about the relative effects of new treatments is typically collected in  randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In many instances, evidence from RCTs falls short of the needs of health technology assessment (HTA). For example, RCTs may not be able to capture longer-term treatment effects, or include all relevant comparators and outcomes required for HTA purposes. Information routinely collected about patients and the care they receive have been increasingly used to complement RCT evidence on treatment effects. However, such routine (or real-world) data are not collected for research purposes, so investigators have little control over the way patients are selected into the study or allocated to the different treatment groups, introducing biases for example due to selection or confounding. A promising approach to minimise common biases in non-randomised studies that use real-world data (RWD) is to apply design principles from RCTs. This approach, known as 'target trial emulation' (TTE), involves (1) developing the protocol with respect to core study design and analysis components of the hypothetical RCT that would answer the question of interest, and (2) applying this protocol to the RWD so that it mimics the data that would have been gathered for the RCT. By making the 'target trial' explicit, TTE helps avoid common design flaws and methodological pitfalls in the analysis of non-randomised studies, keeping each step transparent and accessible. It provides a coherent framework that embeds existing analytical methods to minimise confounding and helps identify potential limitations of RWD and the extent to which these affect the HTA decision. This paper provides a broad overview of TTE and discusses the opportunities and challenges of using this approach in HTA. We describe the basic principles of trial emulation, outline some areas where TTE using RWD can help complement RCT evidence in HTA, identify potential barriers to its adoption in the HTA setting and highlight some priorities for future work.","Department of Applied Health Research, University College London, London, UK.  m.gomes@ucl.ac.uk.; School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Centre for Health Economics, University of York, York, UK.; Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.; Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London, London,  UK.; Science, Policy and Research group, National Institute for Health and Care  Excellence, London, UK.; Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.; School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.",10.1007/s40273-022-01141-x [pii]; 10.1007/s40273-022-01141-x [doi],Gomes M; Latimer N; Soares M; Dias S; Baio G; Freemantle N; Dawoud D; Wailoo A; Grieve R,ORCID: 0000-0002-1428-1232,"© 2022.

37306318,"Tecovirimat is a treatment option for severe mpox, although randomized clinical  trials are ongoing. The aim of the study is to assess the effect of tecovirimat on healing time and the extent of viral clearance by target trial emulation using observational data. Clinical and virological data of patients hospitalized for mpox were collected. Samples from the upper respiratory tract (URT) were grouped in two time points: T1 (median 6 days from symptoms onset) and T2 (median 5 days from T1). Patients were followed-up until recovery. Average treatment effect (ATE) in patients untreated versus treated with tecovirimat was estimated on time to healing and variation in viral load in URT, using a weighted and cloning analysis. Among the 41 patients included, 19 completed a course of tecovirimat. The median time from symptoms onset to hospitalization and to drug-starting was 4 days and 10 days, respectively. No improvement in healing time in treated versus untreated was observed. No difference by treatment group in time to viral clearance was detected by ATE fitted in a subset of 13 patients after controlling for confounders. We found no evidence for a large effect of tecovirimat in shortening healing time and viral clearance. While awaiting the results of randomized studies, the use of tecovirimat should be restricted to the clinical trial setting.","Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Doctoral School of Microbiology, Immunology, Infectious Diseases, and Transplants  (MIMIT), University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.; Centre for Clinical Research, Epidemiology, Modelling, and Evaluation (CREME),  Institute for Global Health, UCL, London, UK.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Laboratory of Virology, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro  Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, ASST Santi Paolo e  Carlo, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Doctoral School of Microbiology, Immunology, Infectious Diseases, and Transplants  (MIMIT), University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.; Laboratory of Virology, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro  Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Pharmacy Unit, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani  IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Laboratory of Virology, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro  Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Scientific Direction, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro  Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; General Direction, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani  IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Laboratory of Virology, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro  Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Research Infectious Diseases, National Institute for  Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy.",10.1002/jmv.28868 [doi],Mazzotta V; Cozzi-Lepri A; Lanini S; Mondi A; Carletti F; Tavelli A; Gagliardini R; Vita S; Pinnetti C; Aguglia C; Colavita F; Faccendini P; Matusali G; Faraglia F; Beccacece A; Paulicelli J; Girardi E; Nicastri E; Vaia F; Maggi F; Antinori A,ORCID: 0000-0002-0240-7504; ORCID: 0000-0003-4096-2610,© 2023 The Authors.

38576166,"Good adherence to antipsychotic therapy helps prevent relapses in first-episode  psychosis (FEP). We used data from the FEP-CAUSAL Collaboration, an international consortium of observational cohorts, to emulate a target trial comparing antipsychotics, with treatment discontinuation as the primary outcome. Other outcomes included all-cause hospitalization. We benchmarked our results to estimates from the European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial, a randomized trial conducted in the 2000s. We included 1097 patients with a psychotic disorder and less than 2 years since psychosis onset. Inverse-probability weighting was used to control for confounding. The estimated 12-month risks of discontinuation for aripiprazole, first-generation agents, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, and risperidone were 61.5% (95% CI, 52.5-70.6), 73.5% (95% CI, 60.5-84.9), 76.8% (95% CI, 67.2-85.3), 58.4% (95% CI, 40.4-77.4), 76.5% (95% CI, 62.1-88.5), and 74.4% (95% CI, 67.0-81.2), respectively. Compared with aripiprazole, the 12-month risk differences were -15.3% (95% CI, -30.0 to 0.0) for olanzapine, -12.8% (95% CI, -25.7 to -1.0) for risperidone, and 3.0% (95% CI, -21.5 to 30.8) for paliperidone. The 12-month risks of hospitalization were similar between agents. Our estimates support use of aripiprazole and paliperidone as first-line therapies for FEP. Benchmarking yielded similar results for discontinuation and absolute risks of hospitalization as in the original trial, suggesting that data from the FEP-CAUSAL Collaboration sufficed to remove confounding for these clinical questions.

39052886,"Causal inference methods intended for use with observational data have been  widely available for decades, but barriers to their widespread adoption exist. These likely include lack of familiarity with several methodological techniques often used in combination in these investigations, such as inverse probability of treatment weighting and g-estimation, and the intensity of computational effort needed to employ these techniques. Even with these methods, critical design flaws undermine the ability to make valid causal inference in some studies. Identification of the need to explicitly pair study design elements with these causal inference methods led to development of a methodological approach recently termed target trial emulation. This approach requires that investigators define a hypothetical randomized trial, emulate that hypothetical protocol in assembling the cohort and defining study elements, and then conduct an analysis that attempts to mirror random treatment assignment. In the accompanying article by Heindel et al (Am J Epidemiol. 2025;194(3):651-658), the authors successfully emulate a target trial of systemic heparin during arteriovenous fistula creation on short-term endpoints by utilizing data from 2 existing randomized trials with key confounders available. Target trial emulation provides a framework with which to promote valid inference and generate high-quality contributions to the literature, and its use should be expanded.","Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at  Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, United States.",7721031 [pii]; kwae222 [pii]; 10.1093/aje/kwae222 [doi],Anderson AH,ORCID: 0000-0002-1454-4282,© The Author(s) 2024.

38503655,"Target trial emulation applies design principles from randomised controlled  trials to the analysis of observational data for causal inference and is increasingly used within human epidemiology. Using anonymised veterinary clinical data from the VetCompass Programme, this study applied the target trial emulation framework to determine whether surgical (compared to non-surgical) management for cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture in dogs causes improved short- and long-term lameness and analgesia outcomes. The emulated target trial included dogs diagnosed with CCL rupture between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 within the VetCompass database. Inclusion in the emulated trial required dogs aged ≥ 1.5 and < 12 years, first diagnosed with unilateral CCL rupture during 2019 and with no prior history of contralateral ligament rupture or stifle surgery. Dogs were retrospectively observed to have surgical or non-surgical management. Informed from a directed acyclic graph derived from expert opinion, data on the following variables were collected: age, breed, bodyweight, neuter status, insurance status, non-orthopaedic comorbidities, orthopaedic comorbidities and veterinary group. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for confounding, with weights calculated based on a binary logistic regression exposure model. Censored dogs were accounted for in the IPTW analysis using inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). The IPCWs were combined with IPTWs and used to weight each dog's contribution to binary logistic regression outcome models. Standardized mean differences (SMD) examined the balance of covariate distribution between treatment groups. The emulated trial included 615 surgical CCL rupture cases and 200 non-surgical cases. The risk difference for short-term lameness in surgically managed cases (compared with non-surgically managed cases) was -25.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) -36.7% to -15.9%) and the risk difference for long-term lameness -31.7% (95% CI -37.9% to -18.1%). The study demonstrated the application of the target trial framework to veterinary observational data. The findings show that surgical management causes a reduction in short- and long-term lameness compared with non-surgical management in dogs.","Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead  Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Herts AL9 7TA, UK.

40355911,"BACKGROUND: In septic shock, the optimal timing of adjunctive vasopressin  initiation shock is unknown. We aimed to assess the effect of its early initiation for patients with septic shock. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter target trial emulation to estimate the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality effect of early (≤ 6 h) adjunctive vasopressin compared with usual care. Eligible patients had septic shock diagnosed within 6 h of ICU admission. The primary outcome of this study was 30-day ICU mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to test the interaction of early vasopressin start with peak norepinephrine-equivalent dose (NED) at 6 h, APACHE score, peak lactate at 6 h and invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were the impact of delayed vasopressin introduction on 30-day ICU mortality and effect of NED at vasopressin start on 30-day ICU mortality. We used the parametric g-formula to emulate a target trial. RESULTS: Overall, 3,105 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 62 years and mean APACHE III score was 83. In the first six hours of vasopressor therapy, 1,864 (60%) patients were invasively ventilated. Estimated 30-day ICU mortality was 19.34% (95%CI, 17.0 to 21.68) in the no vasopressin group and 18.45% (95%CI, 16.26 to 20.63) in the early vasopressin group; relative risk 0.95 (95%CI, 0.93 to 0.98). The estimated 30-day ICU mortality effect of starting vasopressin was particularly strong at lower norepinephrine doses (< 0.25 µg.kg(-1).min(-1)) and significant at lower norepinephrine doses than recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines. Vasopressin administration progressively increased over the study period, from 35.2% (95%CI, 30.0 to 40.5) in 2015 to 45.1% (95%CI, 40.7 to 49.6) in 2021 (ß =  + 1.3% per year; 95%CI, + 0.46 to + 2.16, p = 0.011). Patients had progressively lower norepinephrine equivalent dose (ß = - 0.05 µg.kg(-1).min(-1) per year; 95%CI, - 0.09 to - 0.002, p = 0.038) and lower total SOFA score (ß = - 0.1 point per year; 95%CI, - 0.18 to - 0.07, p < 0.001) at vasopressin start. CONCLUSIONS: In this emulation of a hypothetical target trial, patients with septic shock benefited from early vasopressin administration. These findings can help design prospective randomised-control trials of early adjunctive vasopressin use in septic shock.","Department of Intensive Care Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, 199 Ipswich Road,  Woolloongabba, Brisbane, QLD, 4102, Australia. kyle.white@health.qld.gov.au.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.  kyle.white@health.qld.gov.au.; Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, QLD, Australia.  kyle.white@health.qld.gov.au.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital, 145 Studley Road, Heidelberg, VIC,  Australia.; Department of Critical Care, Department of Medicine, The University of Melbourne,  Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Cairns Hospital, Cairns, QLD, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Townsville Hospital, Townsville, QLD, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, 199 Ipswich Road,  Woolloongabba, Brisbane, QLD, 4102, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Townsville Hospital, Townsville, QLD, Australia.; College of Medicine and Dentistry, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD,  Australia.; Intensive Care Services, Mackay Base Hospital, Mackay, QLD, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Rockhampton Hospital, The Range, QLD, Australia.; School of Medicine and Dentistry, Griffith University, Mount Gravatt, QLD,  Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Sunshine Coast University Hospital, Birtinya, QLD,  Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Caboolture Hospital, Caboolture, QLD, Australia.; Critical Care Division, The George Institute for Global Health, University of New  South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Redcliffe Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Adult Intensive Care Services, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, QLD,  Australia.; Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care Services, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital,  Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Logan Hospital, Logan, QLD, Australia.; School of Medicine and Dentistry, Griffith University, Mount Gravatt, QLD,  Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Gold Coast University Hospital, Southport, QLD, Australia.; Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Australian and New Zealand  Intensive Care Research Centre, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital, 145 Studley Road, Heidelberg, VIC,  Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital, 145 Studley Road, Heidelberg, VIC,  Australia.; Department of Critical Care, Department of Medicine, The University of Melbourne,  Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Australian and New Zealand  Intensive Care Research Centre, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Data Analytics Research and Evaluation Centre, The University of Melbourne and  Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC,  Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital, 145 Studley Road, Heidelberg, VIC,  Australia.; Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Australian and New Zealand  Intensive Care Research Centre, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Intensive Care Unit, Saint Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de  Paris (APHP), Paris, France.",10.1186/s13054-025-05401-y [pii]; 5401 [pii]; 10.1186/s13054-025-05401-y [doi],White KC; Costa-Pinto R; Blank S; Whebell S; Quick L; Luke S; Attokaran AG; Garrett P; Ramanan M; Tabah A; Shekar K; Laupland KB; Kumar A; McCullough J; Udy A; Eastwood G; Bellomo R; Chaba A,,© 2025.

39352756,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies link high midlife systolic blood pressure to  increased dementia risk. However, the synthesis of evidence from randomized controlled trials has not definitively demonstrated that antihypertensive medication use reduces dementia risk. Here, we emulate target trials of antihypertensive medication initiation on incident dementia using three cohort studies, with attention to potential violations of necessary assumptions. METHODS: We emulated trials of antihypertensive medication initiation on incident dementia using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, Cardiovascular Health Study, and Health and Retirement Study. We used data-driven methods to restrict participants to initiators and noninitiators with overlap in propensity scores and positive control outcomes to look for violations of positivity and exchangeability assumptions. RESULTS: Analyses were limited by the small number of cohort participants who met eligibility criteria. Associations between antihypertensive medication initiation and incident dementia were inconsistent and imprecise (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities: HR = 0.30 [0.05, 1.93]; Cardiovascular Health Study: HR = 0.66 [0.27, 1.64]; Health and Retirement Study: HR = 1.09 [0.75, 1.59]). More stringent propensity score restrictions had little effect on findings. Sensitivity analyses using a positive control outcome unexpectedly suggested antihypertensive medication initiation increased the risk of coronary heart disease in all three samples. CONCLUSIONS: Positive control outcome analyses suggested substantial residual confounding in effect estimates from our target trials, precluding conclusions about the impact of antihypertensive medication initiation on dementia risk through target trial emulation. Formalized processes for identifying violations of necessary assumptions will strengthen confidence in target trial emulation and avoid inappropriate confidence in emulated trial results.","From the Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health,  The George Washington University, Washington, DC.; From the Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health,  The George Washington University, Washington, DC.; From the Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health,  The George Washington University, Washington, DC.; Department of Health Care Evaluation, NORC at the University of Chicago,  Bethesda, MD.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California at San  Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health,  University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC.; Memory Impairment and Neurodegenerative Dementia Center, University of  Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS.; Department of Family Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Washington,  Seattle, WA.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Washington,  Seattle, WA.; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD.; Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute of Aging,  Bethesda, MD.; Memory Impairment and Neurodegenerative Dementia Center, University of  Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS.; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann  Arbor, MI.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Washington,  Seattle, WA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California at San  Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; From the Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health,  The George Washington University, Washington, DC.",00001648-202501000-00006 [pii]; 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001802 [doi],Bennett EE; Liu C; Stapp EK; Gianattasio KZ; Zimmerman SC; Wei J; Griswold ME; Fitzpatrick AL; Gottesman RF; Launer LJ; Windham BG; Levine DA; Fohner AE; Glymour MM; Power MC,ORCID: 0000-0002-4195-042,"Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Real-world data (RWD) can provide a robust data basis for comparative research, but the quality is uneven. This review introduces the target trial emulation, in which researchers, using RWD and following the design of clinical trials, define exposure and outcome in advance, set eligibility criteria, determine the time zero, estimate sample size, and plan statistical analysis, to enhance the quality of evidence for observational studies. This review preliminarily discusses the standard of evidence quality evaluation in target trial emulation. Then, the target trial emulation is shown through case interpretation.","Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University,  Nanjing 211166, China.; Department of Biostatistics, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai  200032, China.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University,  Nanjing 211166, China.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University,  Nanjing 211166, China.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University,  Nanjing 211166, China.",10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20230821-00081 [doi],Zhou JW; Huang LL; You DF; Chen F; Zhao Y,,,,,,,2024/02/27 20:42,20240229,,2024 Feb 10,2024/02/28 00:43,,,"Zhou, J W; Huang, L L; You, D F; Chen, F; Zhao, Y",,"82173620, 82373690, 82273733, 82204156/National Natural Science Foundation of  China/; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution/",2,,,0254-6450,0254-6450,8208604,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,chi,10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20230821-00081 [doi],20240229,Humans; *Research Design; Sample Size; Observational Studies as Topic,2024/02/29 06:42,,,,,,NLM,279-285,,2024/02/27 20:42,2024/02/29 06:42,,,2024/02/28 00:43,,China,,,ppublish,English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,,IM,,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2024 Feb 10;45(2):279-285. doi:  10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20230821-00081.,MEDLINE,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,[The emulation of clinical trials with real-world data: development and  application of target trial].,,,,45
38994727,"BACKGROUND: The comparative effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs) has been subjected to relatively little research. However, a recent study based on target trial emulation suggested that sertraline may be more effective than escitalopram. AIMS: To investigate whether sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram differ in their effectiveness-assessed via the risk of psychiatric hospital admission and suicide following treatment initiation. The choice to focus on sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram was made to limit confounding by indication, as the Danish depression treatment guideline from 2007 specifically listed these three SSRIs as first choice. METHOD: We conducted a target trial emulation based on data from Danish registers. We identified all individuals that initiated treatment for depression with sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram in the period from January 1, 2007, to March 1, 2019. These individuals were followed until psychiatric hospital admission or suicide (separate analyses), death, 1 year after treatment initiation or end of data. Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for relevant baseline covariates was performed to emulate randomized treatment allocation, comparing the rate of psychiatric hospital admission and suicide for individuals treated with sertraline (used as reference), citalopram or escitalopram, respectively. For escitalopram, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding data from the period during which the drug was sold under patent, as the price of the drug during that time likely entailed a different prescription pattern, increasing the risk of (""patent-related"") confounding by indication. RESULTS: We identified 56,865, 118,145, and 31,083 individuals initiating treatment with sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram, respectively. Using sertraline as reference, the adjusted hazard rate ratio (aHRR) for psychiatric admission was 0.98 (95% CI = 0.91-1.05) for citalopram and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.10-1.32) for escitalopram. Notably, in the sensitivity analysis only including patients initiating treatment after the escitalopram patent had expired, the increased risk of psychiatric hospital admission associated with escitalopram treatment was no longer present (aHRR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.82-1.18). The results of the analyses of suicide were inconclusive, due to few outcome events. CONCLUSIONS: Sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram do not seem to have differential effectiveness in the treatment of depression. Taking potential patent-related, time varying, confounding by indication (via severity) into account is critical for pharmacoepidemiological studies, including those employing target trial emulation.","Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital - Psychiatry,  Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Pharmacology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg,  Gothenburg, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital - Psychiatry,  Aarhus, Denmark.",10.1111/acps.13729 [doi],Rohde C; Hieronymus F; Østergaard SD,ORCID: 0000-0001-9458-506X; ORCID: 0000-0003-0930-6068; ORCID: 0000-0002-8032-6208,© 2024 The Author(s).

39609410,"Several international pharmacovigilance agencies have issued warnings regarding  the potential risk of myasthenia gravis (MG) following statin therapy. Our study investigated this association using population-based electronic health records in Hong Kong. We conducted a sequence of target trial emulation (TTE) for interpersonal comparison and a self-controlled case series (SCCS) study for intrapersonal comparison. In the TTE for MG onset, the incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) and adjusted HRs were 51.91(31.80, 84.74)[HR:6.11 (3.73, 10.01)] in month 1, 16.27(9.81, 26.99)[HR:1.92(1.15, 3.19) in months 2-4, and 15.27(9.05, 25.79)[HR:1.80(1.06, 3.04)] in months 5-7. For risk of exacerbation, the adjusted HRs were 10.69(5.48, 20.84) in month 1, 1.50(0.55, 4.06) in months 2-4, and 2.79(1.33, 5.84) in months 5-7. No increased risks were found during the subsequent 18 months. A similar pattern was observed in SCCS analysis. Our findings recommend a minimum monitoring period of approximately six months for MG symptoms for patients starting using statin.","Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong  Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Li Ka Shing  Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong  Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Li Ka Shing  Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing  Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong  Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen,  China.; Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, The University of Hong Kong,  Shenzhen, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong, China.; Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom.; School of Pharmacy, Medical Sciences Division, Macau University of Science and  Technology, Macau, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. yfwan@hku.hk.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. yfwan@hku.hk.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong, China. yfwan@hku.hk.",10.1038/s41467-024-54097-1 [pii]; 54097 [pii]; 10.1038/s41467-024-54097-1 [doi],Xu W; Yan VKC; Zhang Z; Fung KK; Chan KH; Lau KK; Chui CSL; Lai FTT; Li X; Chan EWY; Wong ICK; Wan EYF,ORCID: 0000-0001-5225-3032; ORCID: 0000-0002-9121-1959; ORCID: 0000-0003-4836-7808; ORCID: 0000-0002-7602-9470; ORCID: 0000-0001-8242-0014; ORCID: 0000-0002-6275-1147,© 2024.

40593099,"Target trial emulation (TTE) aims to estimate treatment effects by simulating  randomized controlled trials using real-world observational data. Applying TTE across distributed datasets shows great promise in improving generalizability and power but is always infeasible due to privacy and data-sharing constraints. Here we propose a Federated Learning-based TTE framework, FL-TTE, that enables TTE across multiple sites without sharing patient-level data. FL-TTE incorporates federated protocol design, federated inverse probability of treatment weighting, and a federated Cox proportional hazards model to estimate time-to-event outcomes across heterogeneous data. We validated FL-TTE by emulating Sepsis trials using eICU and MIMIC-IV data from 192 hospitals, and Alzheimer's trials using INSIGHT Network across five New York City health systems. FL-TTE produced less biased estimates than traditional meta-analysis methods when compared to pooled results and is theoretically supported. Our FL-TTE enables federated treatment effect estimation across distributed and heterogeneous data in a privacy-preserved way.","Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,  USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,  USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,  USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,  USA.; Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine Program, Weill Cornell  Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,  USA. few2001@med.cornell.edu.",10.1038/s41746-025-01803-y [pii]; 1803 [pii]; 10.1038/s41746-025-01803-y [doi],Li H; Zang C; Xu Z; Pan W; Rajendran S; Chen Y; Wang F,,© 2025.

36814287,"BACKGROUND: The optimal thresholds for the initiation of invasive ventilation in  patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure are unknown. Using the saturation-to-inspired oxygen ratio (SF), we compared lower versus higher hypoxemia severity thresholds for initiating invasive ventilation. METHODS: This target trial emulation included patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, 2008-2019) and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers (AmsterdamUMCdb, 2003-2016) databases admitted to intensive care and receiving inspired oxygen fraction ≥ 0.4 via non-rebreather mask, noninvasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula. We compared the effect of using invasive ventilation initiation thresholds of SF < 110, < 98, and < 88 on 28-day mortality. MIMIC-IV was used for the primary analysis and AmsterdamUMCdb for the secondary analysis. We obtained posterior means and 95% credible intervals (CrI) with nonparametric Bayesian G-computation. RESULTS: We studied 3,357 patients in the primary analysis. For invasive ventilation initiation thresholds SF < 110, SF < 98, and SF < 88, the predicted 28-day probabilities of invasive ventilation were 72%, 47%, and 19%. Predicted 28-day mortality was lowest with threshold SF < 110 (22.2%, CrI 19.2 to 25.0), compared to SF < 98 (absolute risk increase 1.6%, CrI 0.6 to 2.6) or SF < 88 (absolute risk increase 3.5%, CrI 1.4 to 5.4). In the secondary analysis (1,279 patients), the predicted 28-day probability of invasive ventilation was 50% for initiation threshold SF < 110, 28% for SF < 98, and 19% for SF < 88. In contrast with the primary analysis, predicted mortality was highest with threshold SF < 110 (14.6%, CrI 7.7 to 22.3), compared to SF < 98 (absolute risk decrease 0.5%, CrI 0.0 to 0.9) or SF < 88 (absolute risk decrease 1.9%, CrI 0.9 to 2.8). CONCLUSION: Initiating invasive ventilation at lower hypoxemia severity will increase the rate of invasive ventilation, but this can either increase or decrease the expected mortality, with the direction of effect likely depending on baseline mortality risk and clinical context.","Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada. christopher.yarnell@uhn.ca.; Department of Medicine, Division of Respirology, University Health Network and  Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada. christopher.yarnell@uhn.ca.; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto,  Medical-Surgical ICU, 10th floor, 585 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X5, Canada. christopher.yarnell@uhn.ca.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada.; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto,  Medical-Surgical ICU, 10th floor, 585 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X5, Canada.; Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Division of Respirology, University Health Network and  Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada.; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto,  Medical-Surgical ICU, 10th floor, 585 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X5, Canada.; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto,  Medical-Surgical ICU, 10th floor, 585 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X5, Canada.; Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Laboratory for Critical Care Computational  Intelligence, Amsterdam Medical Data Science, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada.; Department of Pharmacy and Medicine, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada.; Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy and Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care,  University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Division of Respirology, University Health Network and  Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto,  Toronto, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Division of Respirology, University Health Network and  Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada.; Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess  Medical Center, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

39494894,"Immortal time may arise in survival analyses when individuals are assigned to  treatment strategies based on post-eligibility information or selected based on post-assignment eligibility criteria. Selection based on eligibility criteria applied after treatment assignment results in immortal time when the analysis starts the follow-up at assignment. Misclassification of assignment to treatment strategies based on treatment received after eligibility results in immortal time when the treatment strategies are not distinguishable at the start of follow-up. Target trial emulation prevents the introduction of immortal time by explicitly specifying eligibility and assignment to the treatment strategies, and by synchronizing them at the start of follow-up. We summarize analytic approaches that prevent immortal time when longitudinal data are available to emulate the target trial from the time of treatment assignment. The term ""immortal time bias"" suggests that the source of the bias is the immortal time, but it is selection or misclassification that generates the immortal time, leading to bias.","From the CAUSALab, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

38864601,"BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is recommended for persons at risk for severe  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but remains underutilized. Information on which eligible groups are likely to benefit from treatment is needed. METHODS: We conducted a target trial emulation study in the Veterans Health Administration comparing nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treated versus matched untreated veterans at risk for severe COVID-19 who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from April 2022 through March 2023. We measured incidence of any hospitalization or all-cause mortality at 30 days. Outcomes were measured for the entire cohort, as well as among subgroups defined by 30-day risk of death or hospitalization, estimated using an ensemble risk prediction model. RESULTS: Participants were 87% male with median age 66 years and 16% unvaccinated. Compared with matched untreated participants, those treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 24 205) had a lower 30-day risk for hospitalization (1.80% vs 2.30%; risk difference [RD], -0.50% points [95% confidence interval {CI}: -.69 to -.35]) and death (0.11% vs 0.30%; RD, -0.20 [95% CI: -.24 to -.13]). The greatest reductions in combined hospitalization or death were observed in the highest risk quartile (RD -2.85 [95% CI: -3.94 to -1.76]), immunocompromised persons (RD -1.91 [95% CI: -3.09 to -.74]), and persons aged ≥75 years (RD -1.16 [95% CI: -1.73 to -.59]). No reductions were observed in the 2 lowest risk quartiles or persons younger than 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was effective in reducing 30-day hospitalization and death in older veterans, those at highest predicted risk for severe outcomes, and immunocompromised groups. Benefit was not observed in younger veterans or groups at lower predicted risk for hospitalization and death.","Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Health Care System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, Portland, Oregon, USA.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Health Care System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Biomedical Informatics & Data Science, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Health Care System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Biomedical Informatics & Data Science, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Center of Innovation to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care (CIVIC), Veterans  Affairs Portland Healthcare System, Portland, Oregon, USA.; Research and Development, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System,  Seattle, Washington, USA.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Health Care System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Health Care System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Center of Innovation to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care (CIVIC), Veterans  Affairs Portland Healthcare System, Portland, Oregon, USA.; Health Management and Policy, School of Social and Behavioral Health Sciences,  College of Public Health and Human Sciences; Health Data and Informatics Program, Center for Quantitative Life Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA.; Veterans Affairs Center for Medication Safety-Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM)  Services, Hines, Illinois, USA.; Office of Research and Development, Veterans Health Administration, Washington  D.C., USA.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Health Care System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Office of Research and Development, Veterans Health Administration, Washington  D.C., USA.; Research and Development, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System,  Seattle, Washington, USA.; Divisions of Gastroenterology, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System  and University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, Portland, Oregon, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Oregon Health and  Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.",7691167 [pii]; 10.1093/cid/ciae202 [doi],Yan L; Bui D; Li Y; Rajeevan N; Rowneki M; Berry K; Argraves S; Huang Y; Hynes DM; Cunningham F; Huang GD; Aslan M; Ioannou GN; Bajema KL,ORCID: 0000-0002-3229-5590,Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of  America 2024.,,,"Potential conflicts of interest.

39708183,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are an important therapeutic  pillar in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). The occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) appears to be associated with improved outcomes in observational studies. However, these associations are likely affected by immortal time bias and do not represent causal effects. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of irAEs on outcomes while correcting for immortal time bias, using target trial emulation (TTE). METHODS: TTE was contrasted to adjusted naïve and time-updated Cox models. We performed a multi-institutional retrospective study involving mUC patients under ICI. The primary objective was to assess the impact of irAEs on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included the influence of irAEs on objective response rates (ORRs) to ICI and the influence of systemic corticosteroids on outcomes. RESULTS: Among 335 patients (median age: 69 yrs), 69.6% received ICI in the second line or further lines. During a median follow-up of 21.1 months, 122 (36.4%) patients developed irAEs of any grade (grade ≥ 3: 14.9%). Hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS ranged from 0.37 for naïve adjusted Cox model to 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59-1.30) with time-updated covariates, and from 0.41 to 1.10 (95% CI, 0.69-1.75) for OS. TTE accounting for immortal time bias yielded a HR of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.72-1.44) for PFS, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.62-1.30) for OS. In contrast to the naïve Cox model (HR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.26-4.05), the presence of irAEs was no longer a predictive factor for improved ORR in time-updated Cox models (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.68-2.36) and TTE (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 0.89-2.29). In patients with irAEs, systemic corticosteroids did not negatively impact survival. CONCLUSION: Using TTE, we were able to show that the occurrence of irAEs is no longer associated with better survival or improved response rates to ICI in mUC patients, in contrast to the naïve analysis. These findings demonstrate that TTE is a suitable formal framework to avoid immortal time bias in studies with time-dependent non-interventional exposures.","Department of Urology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of  Innsbruck, Anichstraße 35, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.

35702149,"IMPORTANCE: Communication and adoption of modern study design and analytical  techniques is of high importance for the improvement of clinical research from observational data. OBJECTIVE: To compare (1) a modern method for causal inference including a target trial emulation framework and doubly robust estimation to (2) approaches common in the clinical literature such as Cox proportional hazards models. To do this, we estimate the effect of corticosteroids on mortality for moderate-to-severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We use the World Health Organization's (WHO) meta-analysis of corticosteroid randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as a benchmark. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using longitudinal electronic health record data for 28 days from time of hospitalization. SETTINGS: Multi-center New York City hospital system. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients hospitalized between March 1-May 15, 2020 with COVID-19 and not on corticosteroids for chronic use. INTERVENTION: Corticosteroid exposure defined as >0.5mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent in a 24-hour period. For target trial emulation, interventions are (1) corticosteroids for six days if and when patient meets criteria for severe hypoxia and (2) no corticosteroids. For approaches common in clinical literature, treatment definitions used for variables in Cox regression models vary by study design (no time frame, one-, and five-days from time of severe hypoxia). MAIN OUTCOME: 28-day mortality from time of hospitalization. RESULTS: 3,298 patients (median age 65 (IQR 53-77), 60% male). 423 receive corticosteroids at any point during hospitalization, 699 die within 28 days of hospitalization. Target trial emulation estimates corticosteroids to reduce 28-day mortality from 32.2% (95% CI 30.9-33.5) to 25.7% (24.5-26.9). This estimate is qualitatively identical to the WHO's RCT meta-analysis odds ratio of 0.66 (0.53-0.82)). Hazard ratios using methods comparable to current corticosteroid research range in size and direction from 0.50 (0.41-0.62) to 1.08 (0.80-1.47). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Clinical research based on observational data can unveil true causal relationships; however, the correctness of these effect estimates requires designing the study and analyzing the data based on principles which are different from the current standard in clinical research.","Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell  Medicine, New York, NY.; Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine,  New York, NY.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell  Medicine, New York, NY.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell  Medicine, New York, NY.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University,  New York, NY.; Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.",2022.05.27.22275037 [pii]; 10.1101/2022.05.27.22275037 [doi],Hoffman KL; Schenck EJ; Satlin MJ; Whalen W; Pan D; Williams N; Díaz I,,,,,,,2022/06/15 02:04,,20220830,2022 Aug 30,2022/06/16 06:00,,,"Hoffman, Katherine L; Schenck, Edward J; Satlin, Michael J; Whalen, William; Pan, Di; Williams, Nicholas; Díaz, Iván",,K23 HL151876/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,,,,,,101767986,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,eng,2022.05.27.22275037 [pii]; 10.1101/2022.05.27.22275037 [doi],20240211,,2022/06/16 06:01,,,,,,NLM,,,2022/06/15 02:04,2022/06/16 06:01,,2022/12/14 00:00,2022/06/16 06:00,,United States,PMC9196111,2022/12/14,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,medRxiv [Preprint]. 2022 Aug 30:2022.05.27.22275037. doi:  10.1101/2022.05.27.22275037.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,medRxiv,Comparison of a Target Trial Emulation Framework to Cox Regression to Estimate  the Effect of Corticosteroids on COVID-19 Mortality.,,JAMA Netw Open. 2022 Oct 3;5(10):e2234425. doi:  10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.34425.

37601338,"BACKGROUND: There is no real-world evidence regarding the association between  beta-blocker use and mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We aimed to investigate the impact of beta-blocker use on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in patients with OSA. METHODS: We conducted a target trial emulation study of 37,581 patients with newly diagnosed OSA from 1st January 2000 to 30th November 2021 using the IMRD-UK database (formerly known as the THIN database). We compared the treatment strategies of initiating beta-blocker treatment within one year versus non-beta-blocker treatment through the method of clone-censor-weight. Covariates, including patients' demographics, lifestyle, comorbidities, and recent medications, were measured and controlled. Patients were followed up for all-cause mortality or composite CVD outcomes (angina, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation). We estimated the five-year absolute risks, risk differences and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with standardised, weighted pooled logistic regression, which is a discrete-time hazard model for survival analysis. Several sensitivity analyses were performed, including multiple imputation addressing the missing data. FINDINGS: The median follow-up time was 4.1 (interquartile range, 1.9-7.8) years. The five-year absolute risk of all-cause mortality and CVD outcomes were 4.9% (95% CI, 3.8-6.0) and 13.0% (95% CI, 11.4-15.0) among beta-blocker users, and 4.0% (95% CI, 3.8-4.2) and 9.4% (95% CI, 9.1-9.7) among non-beta-blocker users, respectively. The five-year absolute risk difference and risk ratio between the two groups for all-cause mortality and CVD outcomes were 0.9% (95% CI, -0.2 to 2.1) and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.96-1.54), and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.1-5.5) and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.22-1.62), respectively. Findings were consistent across the sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Beta-blocker treatment was associated with an increased risk of CVD and a trend for an increased risk of mortality among patients with OSA. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

36252741,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Drawing causal conclusions from real-world data (RWD)  poses methodological challenges and risk of bias. We aimed to systematically assess the type and impact of potential biases that may occur when analyzing RWD using the case of progressive ovarian cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively compared overall survival with and without second-line chemotherapy (LOT2) using electronic medical records. Potential biases were determined using directed acyclic graphs. We followed a stepwise analytic approach ranging from crude analysis and multivariable-adjusted Cox model up to a full causal analysis using a marginal structural Cox model with replicates emulating a reference randomized controlled trial (RCT). To assess biases, we compared effect estimates (hazard ratios [HRs]) of each approach to the HR of the reference trial. RESULTS: The reference trial showed an HR for second line vs. delayed therapy of 1.01 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.82-1.25). The corresponding HRs from the RWD analysis ranged from 0.51 for simple baseline adjustments to 1.41 (95% CI: 1.22-1.64) accounting for immortal time bias with time-varying covariates. Causal trial emulation yielded an HR of 1.12 (95% CI: 0.96-1.28). CONCLUSION: Our study, using ovarian cancer as an example, shows the importance of a thorough causal design and analysis if one is expecting RWD to emulate clinical trial results.","Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology  Assessment, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall i.T., Austria.; Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology  Assessment, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall i.T., Austria.; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.; Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology  Assessment, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall i.T., Austria.; Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology  Assessment, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall i.T., Austria; Chair of Health Sciences/Public Health, Medical Faculty ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck,  Austria.; Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology  Assessment, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall i.T., Austria.; Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology  Assessment, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall i.T., Austria.; Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology  Assessment, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall i.T., Austria; Institute for Clinical Epidemiology, Cancer Registry Tyrol, Tirol Kliniken, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck,  Austria.; Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology  Assessment, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall i.T., Austria; Center for Health Decision Science and Departments of Epidemiology and Health Policy & Management, Harvard T.H.

37775734,"BACKGROUND: Use of combinations of long-acting β(2) agonists/long-acting  muscarinic antagonists (LABA/LAMA) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing. Nevertheless, existing evidence on cardiovascular risk associated with LABA/LAMA versus another dual combination, LABA/inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), was limited and discrepant. AIM: The present cohort study aimed to examine comparative cardiovascular safety of LABA/LAMA and LABA/ICS with a target trial emulation framework, focusing on dual fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapies. METHODS: We identified patients with COPD who initiated LABA/LAMA FDC or LABA/ICS FDC from a nationwide Taiwanese database during 2017-2020. The outcome of interest was a hospitalized composite cardiovascular events of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, and ischemic stroke. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for composite and individual cardiovascular events after matching up to five LABA/LAMA FDC initiators to one LABA/ICS FDC initiator using propensity scores (PS). RESULTS: Among 75,926 PS-matched patients, use of LABA/LAMA FDC did not show a higher cardiovascular risk compared to use of LABA/ICS FDC, with a HR of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78-1.01) for the composite events, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.61-1.05) for acute myocardial infarction, 1.48 (95% CI, 0.68-3.25) for unstable angina, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.80-1.24) for congestive heart failure, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.37-1.05) for cardiac dysrhythmia, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66-1.02) for ischemic stroke. The results did not vary substantially in several pre-specified sensitivity and subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide important reassurance about comparative cardiovascular safety of LABA/LAMA FDC treatment among patients with COPD.","Institute of Public Health, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung  University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming  Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Chest Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.; Faculty of Medicine, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung  University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming  Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.; Institute of Public Health, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung  University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Healthcare Quality Assessment, Graduate School of Medicine, The  University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Institute of Public Health, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung  University, Taipei, Taiwan. yaahuidong@gmail.com.; Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming  Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan. yaahuidong@gmail.com.; Institute of Hospital and Health Care Administration, School of Medicine,  National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan. yaahuidong@gmail.com.",10.1186/s12931-023-02545-9 [pii]; 2545 [pii]; 10.1186/s12931-023-02545-9 [doi],Chen CY; Pan SW; Hsu CC; Liu JJ; Kumamaru H; Dong YH,,"© 2023.

40146950,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Statins have been shown to prevent major vascular  events in a wide range of individuals. However, their potential mechanisms-such as impairing fibrinogen cleavage and reducing thrombin generation-raise concerns on increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Given the inconsistent findings of previous trials and observational studies, this study aims to assess the effect of statins on ICH risk in Chinese population. METHODS: Within the framework of target trial emulation, we used data from the Yinzhou Regional Health Care Database covering the years 2011-2020. The study included patients aged 50 years or older with no history of ICH and statin use. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients were categorized as statin initiators or noninitiators based on their initial treatment regimen during the 1-month enrollment period. Using the sequential trial approach, 60 target trials were emulated each month from 2011 to 2015. Propensity score (PS) matching was applied to balance characteristics between statin initiators and noninitiators within each emulated trial, and these trials were then stacked together into a single data set. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of statin on ICH risk, ICH-related mortality, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 53,413 statin initiators and 35,033,455 noninitiators from 60 emulated trials were included in the analysis. Statin initiators were generally older (mean age 65 vs 63 years), less likely to be male (45.5% vs 50.5%), and more likely to have a history of hypertension (69.0% vs 14.1%). After PS matching, all characteristics between the 2 groups were well balanced. With a median follow-up of 6.7 (interquartile range 5.6-8.1) years, the hazard ratio (HR) of ICH for statin initiators compared with noninitiators was 1.18 (95% CI 1.03-1.35). The HRs of ICH-related mortality and all-cause mortality were 1.16 (95% CI 0.91-1.46) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.97), respectively. Results remained consistent across various subgroup and sensitivity analyses. DISCUSSION: Statin use may increase the risk of ICH in Chinese patients without history of ICH. However, the findings of this study may be limited by residual confounding, particularly the lack of cholesterol-related measurements. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that in Chinese populations, initiation of statins may increase the risk of ICH.","Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.; Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, McGovern Medical School, University  of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.; Department of Chronic Disease and Health Promotion, Yinzhou District Center for  Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Department of Chronic Disease and Health Promotion, Yinzhou District Center for  Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.; International Research Center for Medicinal Administration, Peking University,  Beijing, China.; Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.; International Research Center for Medicinal Administration, Peking University,  Beijing, China.; Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Solna, Sweden.",10.1212/WNL.0000000000213489 [doi],Ji D; Dong S; Wang T; Wei J; Shen P; Lin H; Shi L; Guan X; Xu Y,ORCID: 0000-0002-9701-3638; ORCID: 0000-0002-9953-4752; ORCID: 0000-0002-1290-3827; ORCID: 0000-0002-1074-608X,,,,,,2025/03/27 16:02,20250514,20250327,2025 Apr 22,2025/03/27 18:26,,,"Ji, Dongze; Dong, Shujie; Wang, Tiansheng; Wei, Jingkai; Shen, Peng; Lin, Hongbo; Shi, Luwen; Guan, Xiaodong; Xu, Yang",,,8,,1526-632X,0028-3878,,0401060,Neurology,eng,10.1212/WNL.0000000000213489 [doi],20250521,"Humans; *Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use; *Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology/chemically induced/mortality; Male; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; China/epidemiology; Risk Factors; Aged, 80 and over; East Asian People",2025/03/27 18:27,,,,,,NLM,e213489,,2025/03/27 16:02,2025/03/27 18:27,,,2025/03/27 18:26,,United States,,,ppublish,Journal Article,0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors); Chinese people,IM,,Neurology. 2025 Apr 22;104(8):e213489. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000213489.

39120085,"OBJECTIVES: Optimal timing of tracheostomy in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)  is unknown due to lack of clinical trials. We emulated a target trial to estimate the effect of early vs. delayed tracheostomy strategy on functional outcome of patients with severe TBI. DESIGN: Target trial emulation using 1:1 balanced risk-set matching. SETTING: North American hospitals participating in the TBI Hypertonic Saline randomized controlled trial of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium. PATIENTS: The prematching population consisted of patients with TBI and admission Glasgow Coma Scale less than or equal to 8, who were alive and on mechanical ventilation on the fourth day following trial enrollment, and stayed in the ICU for at least 5 days. Patients with absolute indication for tracheostomy and patients who died during the first 28 days with a decision to withdraw care were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: We matched patients who received tracheostomy at a certain timepoint (early group) with patients who had not received tracheostomy at the same timepoint but were at-risk of tracheostomy in the future (delayed group). The primary outcome was a poor 6-month functional outcome, defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended less than or equal to 4. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Out of 1282 patients available for analysis, 275 comprised the prematching population, with 75 pairs being created postmatching. Median time of tracheostomy differed significantly in the early vs. the delayed group (7.0 d [6.0-10.0 d] vs. 12.0 d [9.8-18.3 d]; p < 0.001). Only 40% of patients in the delayed group received tracheostomy. There was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding poor 6-month functional outcome (early: 68.0% vs. delayed: 72.0%; p = 0.593). CONCLUSIONS: In a target trial emulation, early as opposed to delayed tracheostomy strategy was not associated with differences in 6-month functional outcome following severe TBI. Considering the limitations of target trial emulations, delaying tracheostomy through a ""watchful waiting"" approach may be appropriate.","First Department of Critical Care Medicine and Pulmonary Services, Evangelismos  Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University General  Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.; First Department of Critical Care Medicine and Pulmonary Services, Evangelismos  Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece.; First Department of Critical Care Medicine and Pulmonary Services, Evangelismos  Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece.; First Department of Critical Care Medicine and Pulmonary Services, Evangelismos  Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece.; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.",02107256-202408000-00007 [pii]; CCE-D-24-00152 [pii]; 10.1097/CCE.0000000000001145 [doi],Giannakoulis VG; Psychogios G; Routsi C; Dimopoulou I; Siempos II,ORCID: 0000-0003-0036-3322,"Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

39602027,"Trial emulation, also known as target trial emulation, has significantly advanced  epidemiology and causal inference by providing a robust framework for deriving causal relationships from observational data. This approach aims to reduce biases and confounding factors inherent in observational studies, thereby improving the validity of causal inferences. By designing observational studies to mimic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as closely as possible, researchers can better control for confounding and bias. Key components of trial emulation include defining a clear time-zero, simulating random assignment using techniques like propensity score matching and inverse probability treatment weighting, assessing group comparability by standardized mean differences and establishing a clear comparison strategy. The increasing availability of large-scale real-world databases, such as research cohorts, patient registries, and hospital records, has driven the popularity of target trial emulation. These data sources offer information on patient outcomes, treatment patterns, and disease progression in real-world settings. By applying the principles of target trial emulation to these rich data sources, researchers can design studies that provide robust causal inferences about the effects of interventions, informing clinical guidelines and regulatory decisions. Despite its advantages, trial emulation faces challenges like data quality, unmeasured confounding, and implementation complexity. Future directions include integrating trial emulation with machine learning techniques and developing methods to address unmeasured confounding. Overall, trial emulation represents a significant advancement in epidemiology, offering a valuable tool for deriving accurate and reliable causal inferences from observational data, ultimately improving public health outcomes.","Renal Research Institute, New York, NY, USA. carmine.zoccali@tin.it.; Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics (Biogem), Ariano Irpino, Italy.  carmine.zoccali@tin.it.; Associazione Ipertensione Nefrologia Trapianto Renale (IPNET), c/o Nefrologia,  Grande Ospedale Metropolitano, 89125, Reggio Calabria, Italy. carmine.zoccali@tin.it.; CNR-IFC, Institute of Clinical Physiology, Research Unit of Clinical  Epidemiology, IPNET c/o Nefrologia, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano, 89125, Reggio Calabria, Italy.",10.1007/s40620-024-02158-5 [pii]; 10.1007/s40620-024-02158-5 [doi],Zoccali C; Tripepi G,ORCID: 0000-0002-6616-1996,© 2024.

39964106,"Limited studies compared the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and  molnupiravir against a control group on post-COVID-19 conditions. Our study examined the association of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir with post-acute mortality and hospitalizations among outpatients using real-world outpatient records of COVID-19 designated clinics in Hong Kong. This is an observational study using a target trial emulation framework, involving nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no antiviral treatment (Trial 1) and molnupiravir versus no antiviral treatment (Trial 2). Outcomes included post-acute mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and hospitalization due to 13 selected sequelae. Relative effectiveness was assessed by comparing the cumulative incidence between two groups, reported as relative risk (RR), along with risk differences (RD) during day 0-30, 31-180, and 181-360. After screening, 140,477 and 96,030 patients were included in Trial 1 and 2, respectively. Compared with no treatment, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated patients exhibited a significantly lower risk of post-acute mortality (31-180 days: RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.96; RD, 0.20%; 181-360 days: RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.82; RD, 0.32%) and all-cause hospitalization (31-180 days: RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88; RD, 1.11%; 181-360 days: RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.89; RD, 1.18%). Patients receiving molnupiravir had a lower risk of 30-day mortality, but no significant beneficial effect was observed for the post-acute outcomes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in reducing post-COVID-19 outcomes among outpatients. While we observed the short-term effectiveness of molnupiravir in reducing mortality, no protective effect on long-term post-COVID-19 outcomes was observed.","Centre for Health Systems and Policy Research, School of Public Health and  Primary Care, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.; Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard  T.H.

We emulated a target trial with a multicenter retrospective cohort of hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 without contraindications for azvudine or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir between December 01, 2022 and January 19, 2023 (during the Omicron BA.5.2 variant wave). Exposures included treatment with azvudine or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for 5 days versus no antiviral treatment during hospitalization. Primary composite outcome (all-cause death and initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation), and their separate events were evaluated. Of the 1154 patients, 27.2% were severe cases. In the intent-to-treat analyses, azvudine reduced all-cause death (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.12-0.78), and its composite with invasive mechanical ventilation (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24-0.92). Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced invasive mechanical ventilation (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.17-1.05), and its composite with all-cause death (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18-0.81). The study did not identify credible subgroup effects. The per-protocol analyses and all sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. Both azvudine and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir improved the prognosis of hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.","Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of North  Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.; Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center, Chengdu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Computational Biology and Health Informatics, Shenzhen Institute of  Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.; Primary Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of  Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center, Chengdu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Integrated Care Management Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University,  Chengdu, China.; Integrated Care Management Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University,  Chengdu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of North  Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of North  Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.; West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Institute of Respiratory Health, West China Hospital, Sichuan University,  Chengdu, China.; Precision Medicine Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, West China Hospital,  Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, Cochrane China Center and MAGIC China  Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan  University, Chengdu, China.; Institute of Respiratory Health, West China Hospital, Sichuan University,  Chengdu, China.; Precision Medicine Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, West China Hospital,  Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.",10.1002/jmv.29318 [doi],Zhou Y; Liu Y; Jiang L; Zhang R; Zhang H; Shi Q; Yang Z; Mao Y; Liu S; Yang Z; Ding J; Zhou Y; Ren B; He L; Zhao X; Li W; Li S; Liu D,ORCID: 0000-0003-0060-0287; ORCID: 0000-0001-6791-1704,© 2023 The Authors.

40255411,"Health Technology Assessment (HTA) for reimbursement of all new cancer drugs in  the European Union (EU) will be evaluated for all member states by a central European HTA starting in 2025. EU HTA guidelines for applicants under these new regulations put the focus on meta-analysis of aggregated randomized trial data and are in contrast with the growing number of cancer drug approvals by drug regulators that are based on single arm studies and the needs in the rapidly evolving field of oncological drug development. We advocate to broaden the methodological approaches for HTA by including observational data based causal inference methodology and target trial emulation into the assessments of comparative effectiveness. Causal inference estimates causal estimands, effect measures that reflect a population level effect in terms of contrasts of counterfactual outcomes in the same patients and are directly measured in the target population by modeling of hypothetical intervention. Target trial emulation allows with the use of causal inference to estimate causal effects by mimicking pragmatic trials that evolve apart from randomization like a trial. We illustrate the potential of causal inference for HTA and provide an introduction into causal inference methodology for health scientists involved in HTA.","Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Clinical Research, University  Hospital and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Clinical Research, University  Hospital and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.",S2666-7762(25)00086-9 [pii]; 101294 [pii]; 10.1016/j.lanepe.2025.101294 [doi],Bucher HC; Chammartin F,,© 2025 The Author(s).,,,The corresponding author received no funding for writing of the manuscript.

33372009,"BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether stopping renin-angiotensin system (RAS)  inhibitor therapy in patients with advanced CKD affects outcomes. METHODS: We studied patients referred to nephrologist care, listed on the Swedish Renal Registry during 2007-2017, who developed advanced CKD (eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) while on RAS inhibitor therapy. Using target trial emulation techniques on the basis of cloning, censoring, and weighting, we compared the risks of stopping within 6 months and remaining off treatment versus continuing RAS inhibitor therapy. These included risks of subsequent 5-year all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT). RESULTS: Of 10,254 prevalent RAS inhibitor users (median age 72 years, 36% female) with new-onset eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), 1553 (15%) stopped RAS inhibitor therapy within 6 months. Median eGFR was 23 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Compared with continuing RAS inhibition, stopping this therapy was associated with a higher absolute 5-year risk of death (40.9% versus 54.5%) and major adverse cardiovascular events (47.6% versus 59.5%), but with a lower risk of KRT (36.1% versus 27.9%); these corresponded to absolute risk differences of 13.6 events per 100 patients, 11.9 events per 100 patients, and -8.3 events per 100 patients, respectively. Results were consistent whether patients stopped RAS inhibition at higher or lower eGFR, across prespecified subgroups, after adjustment and stratification for albuminuria and potassium, and when modeling RAS inhibition as a time-dependent exposure using a marginal structural model. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide observational study of people with advanced CKD, stopping RAS inhibition was associated with higher absolute risks of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events, but also with a lower absolute risk of initiating KRT.","Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  The Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska  Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine and Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster  University, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and  Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  The Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute,  Stockholm, Sweden.",00001751-202102000-00017 [pii]; 2020050682 [pii]; 10.1681/ASN.2020050682 [doi],Fu EL; Evans M; Clase CM; Tomlinson LA; van Diepen M; Dekker FW; Carrero JJ,ORCID: 0000-0002-9698-6825; ORCID: 0000-0001-8848-9493; ORCID: 0000-0002-2433-2494,Copyright © 2021 by the American Society of Nephrology.,,,,,2020/12/29 06:01,20210823,20201228,2021 Feb,2020/12/30 06:00,,,"Fu, Edouard L; Evans, Marie; Clase, Catherine M; Tomlinson, Laurie A; van Diepen, Merel; Dekker, Friedo W; Carrero, Juan J",,,2,,1533-3450,1046-6673,1046-6673,9013836,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,eng,10.1681/ASN.2020050682 [doi],20230203,"Aged; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists/*administration & dosage; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage; Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/mortality/*therapy; *Renal Replacement Therapy; Renin-Angiotensin System; Survival Rate; Sweden",2021/08/24 06:00,,,,ACE inhibitors; cardiovascular events; dialysis; kidney disease; mortality risk; renin-angiotensin system,NOTNLM,NLM,424-435,2020/10/06 00:00,2020/12/29 06:01,2021/08/24 06:00,,2022/02/01 00:00,2020/12/30 06:00,2020/05/18 00:00,United States,PMC8054897,2022/02/01,ppublish,"Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",0 (Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists); 0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors),IM,,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2021 Feb;32(2):424-435. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2020050682.

37276589,"BACKGROUND: Information about the effectiveness of oral antivirals in preventing  short- and long-term COVID-19-related outcomes in the setting of Omicron variant transmission and COVID-19 vaccination is limited. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir for outpatient treatment of COVID-19. DESIGN: Three retrospective target trial emulation studies comparing matched cohorts of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no treatment, molnupiravir versus no treatment, and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus molnupiravir. SETTING: Veterans Health Administration (VHA). PARTICIPANTS: Nonhospitalized veterans in VHA care who were at risk for severe COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during January through July 2022. INTERVENTION: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or molnupiravir pharmacotherapy. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of any hospitalization or all-cause mortality at 30 days and from 31 to 180 days. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of participants were male; the median age was 66 years, and 18% were unvaccinated. Compared with matched untreated control participants, those treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 9607) had lower 30-day risk for hospitalization (22.07 vs. 30.32 per 1000 participants; risk difference [RD], -8.25 [95% CI, -12.27 to -4.23] per 1000 participants) and death (1.25 vs. 5.47 per 1000 participants; RD, -4.22 [CI, -5.45 to -3.00] per 1000 participants). Among persons alive at day 31, reductions were seen in 31- to 180-day incidence of death (hazard ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.49 to 0.89]) but not hospitalization (subhazard ratio, 0.90 [CI, 0.79 to 1.02]). Molnupiravir-treated participants (n = 3504) had lower 30-day and 31- to 180-day risks for death (3.14 vs. 13.56 per 1000 participants at 30 days; RD, -10.42 [CI, -13.49 to -7.35] per 1000 participants; hazard ratio at 31 to 180 days, 0.67 [CI, 0.48 to 0.95]) but not hospitalization. A difference in 30-day or 31- to 180-day risk for hospitalization or death was not observed between matched nirmatrelvir- or molnupiravir-treated participants. LIMITATION: The date of COVID-19 symptom onset for most veterans was unknown. CONCLUSION: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was effective in reducing 30-day hospitalization and death. Molnupiravir was associated with a benefit for 30-day mortality but not hospitalization. Further reductions in mortality from 31 to 180 days were observed with both antivirals.

38916712,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and subsequent severe or fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet they have suboptimal responses to mRNA and inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. The efficacy of tixagevimab-cilgavimab in reducing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated in phase III clinical trials. Nevertheless, real-world data on the effectiveness and safety of tixagevimab-cilgavimab remain limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tixagevimab-cilgavimab among immunocompromised individuals. METHODS: Adults who were immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapies were included in this target trial emulation using territory-wide electronic health records in Hong Kong. A sequential trial emulation approach was adopted to compare effectiveness and safety outcomes between individuals who received tixagevimab-cilgavimab and individuals who did not. RESULTS: A total of 746 tixagevimab-cilgavimab recipients and 2980 controls were included from 1 May 2022 to 30 November 2022. Tixagevimab-cilgavimab significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection (hazard ratio [HR] 0.708, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.527-0.951) during a median follow-up of 60 days. No significant difference was observed in the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation. Zero versus eight COVID-19 mortality cases and zero versus two severe COVID-19 cases were observed in tixagevimab-cilgavimab recipients and controls, respectively. Notably, significant risk reduction in COVID-19 infection was also observed among immunocompromised individuals who had been previously vaccinated with three or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine, or had no prior COVID-19 infection history. CONCLUSIONS: Tixagevimab-cilgavimab was effective in reducing COVID-19 infection among immunocompromised patients during the Omicron wave. Findings were consistent among individuals who previously received three or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine, or had no previous history of COVID-19 infection.","Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;

40550404,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular outcome trials are mandated by the US  Food and Drug Administration to assess the cardiovascular safety of new antidiabetic medications before entering the market. However, these trials often involve highly selective populations and results may not generalize to routine practice. METHODS: Our study aimed to synthesize observational studies to assess the generalizability of cardiovascular outcome trials to routine practice. We systematically reviewed observational studies that were target trial emulations of previous cardiovascular outcome trials for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for observational studies that focused on trial emulation or cross-sectional studies that reported the proportion of real-world patients eligible for completed trials. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in our systematic review, including four cohort studies that were target trial emulations of previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 cross-sectional studies that evaluated trial eligibility. Results between RCTs and real-world data (RWD) were concordant for all drug classes in finding noninferiority. The median eligibility percentage ranged from 13% to 31% for SGLT-2 inhibitor trials and 12% to 43% for GLP-1 receptor agonist trials. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, while RCTs and RWD are concordant in their estimates, the trials lack representativeness. More research is needed on the emulation of cardiovascular outcome trials using RWD to understand how different emulation methods may impact findings.","Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill  University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill  University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Jewish General Hospital/McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill  University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

38261322,"IMPORTANCE: Gram-negative bacteremia is a global health concern, and optimizing  the transition from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics is a critical step in improving patient treatment and resource utilization. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture with 90-day all-cause mortality compared with prolonged IV antibiotic treatment for patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study conducted using the target trial emulation framework included observational data from adults with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia in 4 hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark, from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2021. The duration of follow-up was 90 days. Eligibility criteria included a blood culture positive for growth of gram-negative bacteria, clinical stability within 4 days of initial blood culture, an available susceptibility report on day 4, and initiation of appropriate empirical IV antibiotic treatment within 24 hours of blood culture. EXPOSURE: Switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture compared with continuing IV antibiotic treatment for at least 5 days after initial blood culture. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to adjust for confounding. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed using pooled logistic regression to estimate absolute risk, risk difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR); 95% CIs were computed using bootstrapping. RESULTS: A total of 914 individuals were included in the target trial emulation analysis (512 [56.0%] male; median age, 74.5 years [IQR, 63.3-83.2 years]); 433 (47.4%) transitioned early to oral antibiotic treatment, and 481 (52.6%) received prolonged IV treatment. Ninety-nine individuals (10.8%) died during follow-up. The proportion of individuals who died was higher in the group receiving prolonged IV treatment (69 [14.3%] vs 30 [6.9%]). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 90-day all-cause mortality risk was 9.1% (95% CI, 6.7%-11.6%) for the early-switch group and 11.7% (95% CI, 9.6%-13.8%) for the group receiving prolonged IV treatment; the RD was -2.5% (95% CI, -5.7% to 0.7%) and RR was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.60-1.10). In the per-protocol analysis, the RD was -0.1% (95% CI, -3.4% to 3.1%) and RR was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.70-1.40). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia, early transition to oral antibiotics within 4 days of initial blood culture was associated with 90-day all-cause mortality risk comparable to that of continuing IV antibiotic treatment and may be an effective alternative to prolonged IV treatment.","Center of Research & Disruption of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious  Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.; Center of Research & Disruption of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious  Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and  Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Microbiology, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and  Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.; Center of Research & Disruption of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious  Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.",2814214 [pii]; zoi231531 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.52314 [doi],Tingsgård S; Bastrup Israelsen S; Jørgensen HL; Østergaard C; Benfield T,,,JAMA Netw Open. 2024 Jan 2;7(1):e2352250. doi:  10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.52250.

39141078,"BACKGROUND: Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are orally administered  pharmacotherapies for mild to moderate COVID-19. However, the effectiveness of these drugs among very old (≥80 years), hospitalised patients remains unclear, limiting the risk-benefit assessment of these antivirals in this specific group. This study investigates the effectiveness of these antivirals in reducing mortality among this group of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Using a territory-wide public healthcare database in Hong Kong, a target trial emulation study was conducted with data from 13 642 eligible participants for the molnupiravir trial and 9553 for the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir trial. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Immortal time and confounding bias was minimised using cloning-censoring-weighting approach. Mortality odds ratios were estimated by pooled logistic regression after adjusting confounding biases by stabilised inverse probability weights. RESULTS: Both molnupiravir (HR: 0.895, 95% CI: 0.826-0.970) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (HR: 0.804, 95% CI: 0.678-0.955) demonstrated moderate mortality risk reduction among oldest-old hospitalised patients. No significant interaction was observed between oral antiviral treatment and vaccination status. The 28-day risk of mortality was lower in initiators than non-initiators for both molnupiravir (risk difference: -1.09%, 95% CI: -2.29, 0.11) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (risk difference: -1.71%, 95% CI: -3.30, -0.16) trials. The effectiveness of these medications was observed regardless of the patients' prior vaccination status. CONCLUSIONS: Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are moderately effective in reducing mortality risk among hospitalised oldest-old patients with COVID-19, regardless of their vaccination status.","Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, 21 Sassoon Road, Southern District, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;

39207344,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of triptans in migraine patients with  cardiovascular disease or elevated cardiovascular risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrieved data from a multistate US-based health system (January 2000 to August 2022) on adults with migraine and confirmed cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease, or at least two cardiovascular risk factors. We compared the effect of triptans to nontriptan treatments on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and its components at 60 days of starting treatments. We emulated a target trial and used propensity score matching for analysis. RESULTS: The 3518 patients in the triptan group were matched to the 3518 patients in the nontriptan group (median age, 55 years; 80.60% female). At 60 days, 52 patients (1.48%) in the triptan group had MACE, compared with 13 patients (0.37%) in the nontriptan group (relative risk [RR], 4.00; 95% CI, 2.24 to 7.14). Patients treated with triptans also had significantly higher risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (15 patients (0.43%) vs 0 patients (0.00%)); heart failure (RR, 4.50; 95% CI, 1.91 to 10.61); and nonfatal stroke (RR, 8.00; 95% CI, 1.00 to 63.96). Five patients (0.14%) in each group died. The findings were consistent when analyses were restricted to sumatriptan, oral administration of triptan, patients with chronic migraine, history of cardiovascular disease, or history of cerebrovascular disease. CONCLUSION: Triptans likely increase the risk of MACE; however, the incidence of MACE remains low in migraine patients with cardiovascular disease or elevated cardiovascular risk.

40368924,"Tirzepatide, a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)  and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, has shown promise in improving metabolic and cardiovascular profiles in patients with obesity. However, its potential benefits in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remain unclear. We conducted a real-world, retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX global database. A total of 14,154 patients with HFpEF were included after 1:1 propensity score matching. Tirzepatide use was associated with significantly lower risks of the primary composite outcome of heart failure exacerbation and all-cause mortality (HR 0.52), as well as reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.64) and major adverse kidney events (HR 0.44). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent benefits across different strata. Sensitivity analyses using alternative exposure definitions confirmed the robustness of the findings. These results support the potential clinical utility of tirzepatide in HFpEF management and warrant further investigation in randomized controlled trials.","Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chi Mei Medical Centre,  Chiali, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Internal Medicine, Chi Mei Medical Centre, Chiali, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Nursing, Min-Hwei Junior College of Health Care Management, Tainan,  Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University,  Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University,  Tainan, Taiwan. andy10271@gmail.com.; Department of Nutrition, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.  andy10271@gmail.com.; Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.  dtmed141@gmail.com.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, National Sun Yat-sen University,  Kaohsiung, Taiwan. dtmed141@gmail.com.",10.1038/s41467-025-59616-2 [pii]; 59616 [pii]; 10.1038/s41467-025-59616-2 [doi],Lin YM; Liao KM; Yu T; Wu JY; Lai CC,ORCID: 0009-0005-1723-828X; ORCID: 0000-0003-4364-8248; ORCID: 0000-0002-3290-1909; ORCID: 0000-0002-6334-2388,© 2025.

39173034,"Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is one of the main target for  cardiovascular (CV) prevention and therapy. In the last years, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin-Kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9-i) has emerged as a key therapeutic target to lower LDL and were introduced for prevention of CV events. Recently (June 2022) the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) modified the eligibility criteria for the use of PCSK9-i. We designed an observational study to estimate the prevalence of eligible subjects and evaluate the effectiveness of PCSK9-i applying a Target Trial Emulation (TTE) approach based on Electronic Health Records (EHR). Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria were identified from July 2017 (when PCSK9-i became available) to December 2020. Outcomes were all-cause death and the first hospitalization. Among eligible subjects, we identified those treated at date of the first prescription. Inverse Probability of Treatment Weights (IPTW) were estimated including demographic and clinical covariates, history of treatment with statins and the month/year eligibility date. Competing risk models on weighted cohorts were used to derive the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) in subgroups of interest. Out of 1976 eligible subjects, 161 (8%) received treatment with PCSK9-i. Treated individuals were slightly younger, predominantly male, had more severe CV conditions, and were more often treated with statin compared to the untreated subjects. The latter exhibited a higher prevalence of non-CV comorbidities. A significant absolute and relative risk reduction of death and a lower relative risk for the first hospitalization was observed. The risk reduction for death was confirmed in CATE analysis. PCSk9-i were prescribed to a minority of eligible subjects. Within the TTE framework, the analysis confirmed the association between PCSK9-i and lower risk of events, aligning with findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). In our study, PCSK9-i provided protection specifically against all-cause death, expanding upon the evidence from RCTs that had primarily focused on composite CV outcomes.","Biostatistics Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Trieste,  Trieste, Italy.; Biostatistics Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Trieste,  Trieste, Italy.; MOX-Modelling and Scientific Computing Laboratory, Department of Mathematics,  Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.; Aging Research Center, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society,  Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.; Cardiovascular Center, Territorial Specialistic Department, University Hospital  and Health Services of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Cardiovascular Center, Territorial Specialistic Department, University Hospital  and Health Services of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Cardiovascular Center, Territorial Specialistic Department, University Hospital  and Health Services of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.; Cardiovascular Center, Territorial Specialistic Department, University Hospital  and Health Services of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.",PONE-D-24-04560 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pone.0309470 [doi],Barbati G; Gregorio C; Scagnetto A; Indennidate C; Cappelletto C; Di Lenarda A,ORCID: 0000-0001-8942-5686; ORCID: 0009-0006-0012-5542,"Copyright: © 2024 Barbati et al.

36921986,"AIMS: To examine the dose dependency of diclofenac's cardiovascular risks.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish health registries and the target trial emulation design, we conducted a series of 300 nationwide cohort studies during 1996-2020, each mimicking the strict design criteria of a clinical trial. Adults eligible for inclusion had no recent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions, contraindications (gastrointestinal diseases, thrombocytopenia, or heart failure), or conditions with low adherence (dementia or psychiatric disease). Diclofenac initiators were compared to healthcare-seeking non-initiators and head-to-head using an approximated high dose of ≥150 mg/day vs. low dose of <150 mg/day. Cox regression was used to compute the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 30 days following initiation. We adjusted for age, sex, calendar period, comorbidity, comedication, and socioeconomic position. Compared with non-initiators (n = 3 789 617), diclofenac initiators (n = 1 894 834) had an approximately 50% increased rate of MACE (IRR 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-1.63), reflecting IRRs of 1.54 (95% CI: 1.40-1.69) for myocardial infarction, 1.29 (1.14-1.45) for ischaemic stroke, and 1.92 (1.71-2.16) for cardiac death. The risk increase was observed for most conditions with chronic pain, in particular headache (IRR 5.10, 95% CI: 1.46-17.85). The risk increase was similar for initiators of high- (IRR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.40-1.71) and low-dose diclofenac (IRR 1.52, 1.41-1.63), which was confirmed in a head-to-head analysis (IRR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.90-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Initiators of high- and low-dose diclofenac had comparably increased cardiovascular risks. This finding provides evidence against the assumption that low-dose diclofenac is risk-neutral.","Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Olof Palmes Allé  43-45, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens  Boulevard 99, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.; Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens  Boulevard 99, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.; Center for Neuroplasticity and Pain, Department of Health Science and Technology,  School of Medicine, Aalborg University, 9000 Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Gastroenterology, Mech-Sense, Aalborg University Hospital,  9000 Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens  Boulevard 99, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.; Department of Rheumatology, Aarhus University Hospital, 8200 Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Olof Palmes Allé  43-45, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens  Boulevard 99, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Olof Palmes Allé  43-45, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens  Boulevard 99, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.",7078560 [pii]; 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvad018 [doi],Schmidt M; Arendt-Nielsen L; Hauge EM; Sørensen HT; Pedersen L,ORCID: 0000-0002-4935-4059,© The Author(s) 2023.

40153442,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immunotherapy has emerged as an effective treatment for  advanced HCC. We aimed to investigate the real-world effectiveness of immunotherapy compared to lenvatinib in HCC. APPROACH AND RESULTS: From the TriNetX database, we used a target trial emulation framework and identified patients with HCC who received first-line treatment with immunotherapy (atezolizumab/bevacizumab or tremelimumab/durvalumab) or lenvatinib between or between August 2018 and December 2023. OS was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression. After propensity score matching, 1203 patients were included in each group. Immunotherapy was associated with improved OS versus lenvatinib (median survival: 545 vs. 425 d; HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.97). Regarding treatment type, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed improved survival compared to lenvatinib (n=1070 in each group; HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.99), while the point estimate favored durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus lenvatinib (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.59-1.12), though this difference was not statistically significant, likely due to small sample size. Regarding etiology, immunotherapy had improved OS compared to lenvatinib in viral hepatitis (n=510 in each group; HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61-0.89) and alcohol-associated liver disease (n=190 in each group; HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87), but not in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases (n=156 in each group; HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.31). CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world analysis, immunotherapy was associated with improved OS compared to lenvatinib in advanced HCC, with consistent benefit across most subgroups. These findings support the use of immunotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC.","Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine,  Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; University of Bristol Medical School, Bristol, UK.; Department of Medicine, Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles,  California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles,  California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles,  California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles,  California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles,  California, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, UT  Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine,  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New  York, USA.; Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College at Cornell University, New York,  New York, USA.; Center for Global Health, Perelman School of Medicine, University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas,  USA.; Department of Medicine, Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles,  California, USA.",01515467-990000000-01221 [pii]; 10.1097/HEP.0000000000001328 [doi],Ahn JC; Ng WH; Yeo YH; Kim HS; Wang Y; Trivedi H; Ayoub WS; Kuo A; Rich N; Parikh ND; Abou-Alfa GK; Ma KS; Singal AG; Yang JD,,Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.,,,,,2025/03/28 13:42,,20250328,2025 Mar 28,2025/03/28 18:25,,,"Ahn, Joseph C; Ng, Wee Han; Yeo, Yee Hui; Kim, Hyun-Seok; Wang, Yun; Trivedi, Hirsh; Ayoub, Walid S; Kuo, Alexander; Rich, Nicole; Parikh, Neehar D; Abou-Alfa, Ghassan K; Ma, Kevin Sheng-Kai; Singal, Amit G; Yang, Ju Dong",,R01 CA255727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01 CA277530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R21 CA280444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,,,1527-3350,0270-9139,,8302946,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",eng,10.1097/HEP.0000000000001328 [doi],20250722,,2025/03/28 18:25,,,,hepatocellular carcinoma; immunotherapy; lenvatinib; real world; target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,,2025/03/11 00:00,2025/03/28 13:42,2025/03/28 18:25,,,2025/03/28 18:25,2024/11/14 00:00,United States,,,aheadofprint,Journal Article,,IM,,Hepatology. 2025 Mar 28. doi: 10.1097/HEP.0000000000001328.,Publisher,Hepatology,Comparative effectiveness of immunotherapy versus lenvatinib in advanced  hepatocellular carcinoma: A real-world analysis using target trial emulation.,,,,
34089045,"The number of operations that surgeons have previously performed is associated  with their patients' outcomes. However, this association may not be causal, because previous studies have often been cross-sectional and their analyses have not considered time-varying confounding or positivity violations. In this paper, using the example of surgeons who perform coronary artery bypass grafting, we describe (hypothetical) target trials for estimation of the causal effect of the surgeons' operative volumes on patient mortality. We then demonstrate how to emulate these target trials using data from US Medicare claims and provide effect estimates. Our target trial emulations suggest that interventions on physicians' volume of coronary artery bypass grafting operations have little effect on patient mortality. The target trial framework highlights key assumptions and draws attention to areas of bias in previous observational analyses that deviated from their implicit target trials.

39476445,"BACKGROUND: Demonstration of trial emulation ability to benchmark randomised  controlled trials (RCTs) from real-world data (RWD) is required to increase confidence in the use of routinely collected data for decision making in oncology. METHODS: To assess the frequency with which emulation findings align with RCTs regarding effect size on overall survival (OS) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), 8 of 13 pre-selected pivotal RCTs in MBC were emulated using data from 32,598 patients enrolled in the French ESME-MBC cohort between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2021. Adjustment methods and confounders were selected a priori for each emulation; stabilized weight was the reference method to mitigate confounding. Concordance in OS hazard ratios with associated 95 % confidence intervals between RCTs and emulations were assessed used predefined metrics based on statistical significance, estimates, and standardized differences. RESULTS: The effect sizes were consistent with RCT results in 7 out of the 8 emulations; 4 emulations achieved full statistical significance agreement; 5 emulations had a point estimate included in the RCT CI (estimate agreement); 6 emulations reported no significant differences between RCT and emulation (standardized difference agreement). Discrepancies related to residual confounders and significant shifts in prescription practices post-drug approval may arise in some cases. CONCLUSION: Target trial emulation from RWD combined with appropriate adjustment can provide conclusions similar to RCTs in MBC. In oncology, this methodology offers opportunities for confirming the impact on long-term survival, for expanding indications in patients excluded from RCTs and for comparative effectiveness in single-arm trials using external control arms.","Clinical Research Department, Centre Léon Bérard, Lyon, France; UMR CNRS 5558  LBBE, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, Villeurbanne, France.

40128798,"BACKGROUND: Longitudinal cohort studies across the lifespan suggest an  association between ultra-processed food (UPF) and depression. However, the effect of UPF on depression and mental health in older adults has not been determined. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of UPF on depressive symptoms and mental health in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: A pragmatic target trial was designed and emulated using the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly longitudinal data. Participants were community-dwelling older adults (≥ 70 years) in Australia. We specified and emulated the protocol of a two-arm randomised pragmatic clinical trial using the level of UPF consumption as the intervention. Greater than or equal to 4 servings of UPF per day was considered the intervention, with less than 4 servings per day the control. Dietary consumption was assessed using a mail-based diet screening questionnaire, and the level of food processing was classified based on the NOVA classification. The study outcomes were depressive symptoms, defined as a score of ≥ 8 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 10-item scale, and general mental health, defined by the mental component summary score of the Short Form-12. We applied inverse probability treatment weighting to balance confounders. Marginal structural models were employed to estimate the population-level average effect of intervention using generalised estimated equations. RESULTS: A total of 11,192 participants (3415 intervention and 7777 control) were eligible for the emulation. High UPF consumption at time zero was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms at follow-ups (RR: 1.10; CI: 1.04-1.18). The finding was consistent with sensitivity analyses; after excluding participants on antidepressants at time zero, the risk of depressive symptoms in the intervention group was increased by 11% compared to the control (RR: 1.11; 95% CI: (1.04-1.20)). Consumption of UPF adversely affected the mental component quality of life (β: - 0.40; CI: - 0.65 to - 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: A higher level of UPF consumption was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms and adversely affected mental health among older adults.","Deakin University, the Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical  Translation (IMPACT), School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia. b.miteku@deakin.edu.au.; College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Debre Markos University, Debre Markos,  Ethiopia. b.miteku@deakin.edu.au.; Deakin University, the Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical  Translation (IMPACT), School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.; Deakin University, the Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical  Translation (IMPACT), School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; Department of Medicine-Western Health, The University of Melbourne, St Albans,  Victoria, Australia.; Deakin University, the Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical  Translation (IMPACT), School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.; Deakin University, the Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical  Translation (IMPACT), School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.; Deakin University, the Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical  Translation (IMPACT), School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.; Deakin University, the Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical  Translation (IMPACT), School of Medicine, Geelong, VIC, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; Biostatistics Unit, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC,  Australia.",10.1186/s12916-025-04002-4 [pii]; 4002 [pii]; 10.1186/s12916-025-04002-4 [doi],Mengist B; Lotfaliany M; Pasco JA; Agustini B; Berk M; Forbes M; Lane MM; Orchard SG; Ryan J; Owen AJ; Woods RL; McNeil JJ; Mohebbi M,,© 2025.

35344378,"BACKGROUND: The risks for anaphylaxis among intravenous (IV) iron products  currently in use have not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: To compare risks for anaphylaxis among 5 IV iron products that are used frequently. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using a target trial emulation framework. SETTING: Medicare fee-for-service data with Part D coverage between July 2013 and December 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults receiving their first administration of IV iron. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the occurrence of anaphylaxis within 1 day of IV iron administration, ascertained using a validated case definition. Analysis was adjusted for 40 baseline covariates using inverse probability of treatment weighting. The adjusted incidence rates (IRs) for anaphylaxis per 10 000 first administrations and odds ratios (ORs) were computed. RESULTS: The adjusted IRs for anaphylaxis per 10 000 first administrations were 9.8 cases (95% CI, 6.2 to 15.3 cases) for iron dextran, 4.0 cases (CI, 2.5 to 6.6 cases) for ferumoxytol, 1.5 cases (CI, 0.3 to 6.6 cases) for ferric gluconate, 1.2 cases (CI, 0.6 to 2.5 cases) for iron sucrose, and 0.8 cases (CI, 0.3 to 2.6 cases) for ferric carboxymaltose. Using iron sucrose as the referent category, the adjusted ORs for anaphylaxis were 8.3 (CI, 3.5 to 19.8) for iron dextran and 3.4 (CI, 1.4 to 8.3) for ferumoxytol. When cohort entry was restricted to the period after withdrawal of high-molecular-weight iron dextran from the U.S. market in 2014, the risk for anaphylaxis associated with low-molecular-weight iron dextran (OR, 8.4 [CI, 2.8 to 24.7]) did not change appreciably. Anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalizations were observed only among patients using iron dextran or ferumoxytol. LIMITATION: Generalizability to non-Medicare populations. CONCLUSION: The rates of anaphylaxis were very low with all IV iron products but were 3- to 8-fold greater for iron dextran and ferumoxytol than for iron sucrose.

40573925,"Background: The MVA-BN vaccine is considered effective for preventing mpox in key  populations, based on observational studies, though no randomized trials have yet confirmed its effectiveness. Observational studies published to date rely on retrospective analyses of routine data, often missing information on relevant risk factors for mpox. Methods: Multi-country target trial emulation study with prospective data collection. Between 1 September 2022 and 15 June 2023, we recruited individuals eligible for mpox vaccination based on clinical history and exposure behaviors via healthcare centers and social venues in Spain, Peru, Panama, and Chile. Vaccinated individuals were paired with unvaccinated counterparts matched by mpox risk factors, country, recruitment date, and age. Follow-up continued via periodic surveys until 31 March 2024. The primary endpoint was symptomatic mpox occurrence ≥14 days post-vaccination. Results: The primary analysis included 1028 individuals (514 vaccinated, 514 unvaccinated) with a median follow-up time of 9.3 months (IQR 4.7-13.7). Mpox occurred in eight participants (0.8%): three vaccinated and five unvaccinated (HR 0.6; 95% CI 0.21-1.70). Adverse reactions were reported by 731 (49.6%) participants, predominantly skin reactions (703/1475; 47.7%), while systemic reactions occurred in 107 (7.3%). Long-lasting erythema at the injection site was reported in 450/1058 (42.5%) participants, persisting >6 months in 107 of them (23.8%). Conclusions: The low incidence of mpox during the study period resulted in a limited number of endpoint events, precluding robust conclusions on the efficacy of the MVA-BN vaccine as pre-exposure prevention for mpox. However, our analysis, which accounted for key confounders such as exposure behaviors, yielded results consistent with previous studies suggesting the effectiveness of the vaccine in the mpox setting.","Skin NTDs and STI Section, Fight Infections Foundation, Germans Trias i Pujol  University Hospital, 08916 Badalona, Spain.;

40136231,"OBJECTIVE: Agitation is a major problem in the intensive care unit. However, no  treatment has clearly emerged as effective and safe. Using target trial emulation, we aimed to test the hypothesis that early intervention with dexmedetomidine would accelerate agitation resolution. METHODS: We read clinical notes in an electronic medical records system with natural language processing to identify patients with agitation. We obtained their demographics, trajectories, associations, and outcomes. We used g-formulas to study the possible effects of dexmedetomidine on agitation resolution and key outcomes. RESULTS: We screened 7525 patients. Overall, 2242 patients (29.8%) developed within-intensive care unit agitation, and 2052 (27.3%) were eligible for inclusion in the target trial emulation, with 314 treated with dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine-treated patients had more severe illness and were more likely to have unplanned emergency admissions with medical diagnoses. However, they achieved higher rates of resolution of within-intensive care unit agitation (94% versus 72%; p < 0.001) and lower 30-day mortality (5% versus 9%; p = 0.033). Early initiation of dexmedetomidine accelerated the resolution of agitation (risk ratio [RR] 1.13 [95%CI 1.03 - 1.21]; risk difference [RD] 9.8% [95%CI 2.6% - 15.4%]); extubation by Day 30 (RR 1.03 [95%CI 1.02 - 1.04]; RD 3.1% [95%CI 2.2% - 4.2%]); and reduced the chance of having a tracheostomy by Day 30 (RR 0.67 [95%CI 0.34 - 0.99]; RD -3.5% [95%CI -7.0% - -0.0%]). CONCLUSION: Through target trial emulation analysis, early dexmedetomidine was associated with an increased rate of resolution of agitation and extubation and decreased tracheostomy risk.","Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Critical Care, Melbourne Medical School, University of Melbourne,  Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Business Intelligence Unit, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Business Intelligence Unit, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Business Intelligence Unit, Austin Hospital - Melbourne, Australia.; Monash Health School of Clinical Sciences, Monash University - Melbourne,  Victoria, Australia.; Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre, School of Public  Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University - Melbourne, Australia.",S2965-27742025000100308 [pii]; 10.62675/2965-2774.20250010 [doi],Serpa Neto A; Young M; Phongphithakchai A; Maeda A; Hikasa Y; Pattamin N; Kitisin N; Premaratne G; Chan G; Furler J; Stevens M; Pandey D; Jahanabadi H; Shehabi Y; Bellomo R,ORCID: 0000-0003-1520-9387; ORCID: 0000-0002-6195-660X; ORCID: 0000-0001-8422-2644; ORCID: 0009-0004-7388-9450; ORCID: 0000-0001-6133-765X; ORCID: 0009-0008-5125-9756; ORCID: 0000-0001-9703-3551; ORCID: 0009-0005-5360-6393; ORCID: 0009-0008-6158-9724; ORCID: 0009-0008-7594-7975; ORCID: 0000-0003-0553-7686; ORCID: 0000-0003-2128-5570; ORCID: 0000-0002-8431-6779; ORCID: 0000-0003-4707-7462; ORCID: 0000-0002-1650-8939,,,,Conflicts of interest: None.,,2025/03/26 11:14,20250514,20250324,2025,2025/03/26 12:30,,,"Serpa Neto, Ary; Young, Marcus; Phongphithakchai, Atthaphong; Maeda, Akinori; Hikasa, Yukiko; Pattamin, Nuttapol; Kitisin, Nuanprae; Premaratne, Gehan; Chan, Gabriel; Furler, Joseph; Stevens, Meg; Pandey, Dinesh; Jahanabadi, Hossein; Shehabi, Yahya; Bellomo, Rinaldo",,,,,2965-2774,2965-2774,,9918627781706676,Critical care science,eng,S2965-27742025000100308 [pii]; 10.62675/2965-2774.20250010 [doi]; e20250010,20250514,*Dexmedetomidine/therapeutic use/administration & dosage; Humans; *Psychomotor Agitation/drug therapy; *Intensive Care Units; Female; Male; Middle Aged; *Hypnotics and Sedatives/therapeutic use/administration & dosage; Aged; Adult,2025/03/26 12:31,,,,,,NLM,e20250010,2025/02/11 00:00,2025/03/26 11:14,2025/03/26 12:31,,2025/03/14 00:00,2025/03/26 12:30,2025/01/08 00:00,Brazil,PMC11991816,2025/03/14,epublish,Journal Article,67VB76HONO (Dexmedetomidine); 0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives),IM,,Crit Care Sci. 2025 Mar 24;37:e20250010. doi: 10.62675/2965-2774.20250010.  eCollection 2025.,MEDLINE,Crit Care Sci,A target trial emulation of dexmedetomidine to treat agitation in the intensive  care unit.,,,,37
39625617,"Contemporary data from randomized clinical trials focusing on the effect of oral  hormone therapy (HT) on venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women aged 50-60 years are scarce despite evolving HT regimens. Here, we evaluated the association between HT and the risk of developing VTE using a target trial emulation among women of menopausal age. This retrospective cohort study applied a target trial emulation framework using claims data from a universal health insurance program in Taiwan. We emulated a sequence of trials in which women aged 50-60 years with no previous history of HT, hysterectomy, gynecologic disorders, or cardiovascular events were enrolled. Eligibility and HT use were evaluated monthly from 2011 to 2019. Eligible women were classified as either HT initiators or non-initiators for each consecutive month. Observational analogs of the intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects were estimated using pooled logistic regression models. Of the 150,686,148 eligible person-trials (3,001,112 women), 192,215 initiators and 768,860 propensity score-matched non-initiators were included in the analysis. The average duration of the HT was 1.25 years. Over a median follow-up of 5.83 years, 3,334 women developed VTE. The estimated hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.96 (0.88, 1.04) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.66 (0.41, 1.05) in per-protocol analysis. The estimated intention-to-treat and per-protocol 5-year VTE-free survival differences (95% confidence interval) were 0.1‰ (- 0.3‰, 0.7‰) and 0.3‰ (- 2.8‰, 4.0‰), respectively. In the contemporary clinical setting, we did not observe an increased VTE risk associated with HT in women aged 50-60 years.","National Center for Geriatrics and Welfare Research, National Health Research  Institutes, 35, Keyan Road, Miaoli, 350, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, China Medical University Hospital,  Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung,  Taiwan.; National Center for Geriatrics and Welfare Research, National Health Research  Institutes, 35, Keyan Road, Miaoli, 350, Taiwan. peichun.chen@nhri.edu.tw.; Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.  peichun.chen@nhri.edu.tw.",10.1007/s10654-024-01181-x [pii]; 10.1007/s10654-024-01181-x [doi],Yeh YC; Cherry Yin; Yi Chang; Chen PC,ORCID: 0009-0004-4307-4218; ORCID: 0000-0003-2529-8125; ORCID: 0000-0002-8713-8816,© 2024.

39993315,"BACKGROUND: Although glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have  shown potential antidepressant effects, population studies yield inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk for depression in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating treatment with GLP-1RAs versus sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is). DESIGN: Target trial emulation study. SETTING: U.S. National Medicare administrative data from January 2014 to December 2020. PATIENTS: Adults aged 66 years or older with T2D initiating treatment with a GLP-1RA were matched 1:1 on propensity score with those initiating treatment with either an SGLT2i or a DPP4i. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was incident depression. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI within matched groups. RESULTS: A total of 14 665 matched pairs of older adults were included in the cohort for GLP-1RAs versus SGLT2is; the rate difference of depression between GLP-1RA users and SGLT2i users was 3.48 (95% CI, -0.81 to 7.78) per 1000 person-years, with an HR of 1.07 (CI, 0.98 to 1.18). In the cohort for GLP-1RAs versus DPP4is (13 711 matched pairs), the rate difference was -5.78 (CI, -10.49 to -1.07) per 1000 person-years, with an HR of 0.90 (CI, 0.82 to 0.98). LIMITATION: Unmeasured confounders (such as hemoglobin A(1c) levels and body mass index), outcome misclassification, and limited generalizability to all GLP-1RA users (for example, younger populations or those without T2D receiving the drug for obesity treatment). CONCLUSION: Among older adults with T2D, the incidence of depression was relatively low. Use of GLP-1RAs was associated with a modestly lower risk for depression compared with use of DPP4is, but not SGLT2is.

38973750,"The 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research  recommends sustained strategies of physical activity and diet for cancer prevention, but evidence for long-term prostate cancer risk is limited. Using observational data from 27 859 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we emulated a target trial of recommendation-based physical activity and dietary strategies and 26-year risks of prostate cancer, adjusting for risk factors via the parametric g-formula. Compared with no intervention, limiting sugar-sweetened beverages showed a 0.4% (0.0%-0.9%) lower risk of lethal (metastatic or fatal) disease and 0.5% (0.1%-0.9%) lower risk of fatal disease. Restricting consumption of processed foods showed a 0.4% to 0.9% higher risk of all prostate cancer outcomes. Estimated risk differences for clinically significant disease were close to null for strategies involving fruits and nonstarchy vegetables, whole grains and legumes, red meat, and processed meat, as well as under a joint strategy of physical activity and diet. Compared with a ""low-adherence"" strategy, maintaining recommended physical activity levels showed a 0.4% (0.1%-0.8%) lower risk of lethal and 0.5% (0.2%-0.8%) lower risk of fatal disease. Adhering to specific components of current physical activity and dietary recommendations may help to prevent lethal and fatal prostate cancer over 26 years.","Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

37369393,"INTRODUCTION: Observational studies represent an alternative to estimate  real-world causal effects in the absence of available randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Target trial emulation is a framework for the application of RCT design principles to emulate a hypothetical open-label RCT (the hypothetical target trial) using existing observational data as the primary data source as opposed to the prospective recruitment and measurement of randomised units. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the practices of studies applying the target trial emulation framework to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will systematically search in Medline (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid, entries from medRxiv are included), PsycINFO (via Ovid), SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, the ISRCTN registry and ClinicalTrials.gov for all study reports and protocols which used the trial emulation framework (without time restriction). We will extract information concerning study design, data source, analysis, results, interpretation and dissemination. Two reviewers will perform study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Disagreements between reviewers will be resolved by a third reviewer. A narrative approach will be used to synthesise and report qualitative and quantitative data. Reporting of the review will be informed by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidance (PRISMA). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as it is a protocol for a systematic review. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.","Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne,  UK theophile.bigirumurame@newcastle.ac.uk.; Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne,  UK.; Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne,  UK.; Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne,  UK.; Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne,  UK.; Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne,  UK.",bmjopen-2022-070963 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-070963 [doi],Bigirumurame T; Hiu SKW; Teare MD; Wason JMS; Bryant A; Breckons M,ORCID: 0000-0003-2387-4918; ORCID: 0000-0003-1699-4348; ORCID: 0000-0003-3994-0051; ORCID: 0000-0002-4691-126X; ORCID: 0000-0003-4351-8865; ORCID: 0000-0003-3057-6767,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

40082958,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), which is  predominately derived from small high-risk older populations and focuses on specific influenza-related complications, might not be generalizable to real-world older populations with diverse characteristics in Taiwan. Therefore, this observational study with a target trial emulation framework aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of an influenza vaccine on influenza infection, complications, and associated healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: 1,214,392 propensity-score-matched pairs of vaccinated and unvaccinated older populations from the influenza season of 2018/2019 were identified from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. VE (estimated as 1 minus hazard ratio [HR]*100%) and the HRs were used for influenza events and associated complications, respectively. RESULTS: Primary analyses show 14% (10-18%) of VE against influenza-associated hospitalization, irrespective of age, frailty status, and underlying influenza risk. Notably, a decline in VE for influenza-associated hospitalization was observed when the observational period following vaccination was extended (25% [19-30%], 23% [18-28%], and 14% [10-18%] for the intervals October 2018-March 2019, October 2018-May 2019, and October 2018-September 2019, respectively). Compared with non-vaccination, having an influenza vaccination significantly reduced risks of influenza-associated death by 30%, various respiratory by 12-26%, cardiovascular complications by 39-47%, and acute kidney injury by 23%. Approximately savings of USD 3,000,000 in total from averting influenza-associated hospitalization following vaccination were found. The non-significant effects of the influenza vaccine on negative control outcomes support the validity of the study procedures. CONCLUSIONS: VE for severe influenza events (i.e., those requiring hospitalization) and related complications among the real-world older population was corroborated. To avoid severe influenza episodes and complications and minimize associated economic consequences, continuous influenza vaccine uptake over different influenza seasons is recommended for this population.","Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Global Health Program, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University,  Taipei, Taiwan.; National Taiwan University Children's Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College  of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, National Cheng Kung University National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital Dou-Liou  Branch, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Yunlin, Taiwan.; Department of Family Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung  University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. huangtz@mail.ncku.edu.tw.; Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University,  Tainan, Taiwan. huangtz@mail.ncku.edu.tw.",10.1186/s12916-025-03955-w [pii]; 3955 [pii]; 10.1186/s12916-025-03955-w [doi],Peng ZY; Hua YT; Huang WT; Wu JS; Ou HT,,© 2025.

37913816,"To date, there is a lack of randomized trial data examining the use of the  antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pregnant persons. This target trial emulation study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in nonhospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection. Among patients diagnosed between 16 March 2022 and 5 February 2023, exposure was defined as outpatient nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment within 5 days of symptom onset or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. Primary outcomes were maternal morbidity and mortality index (MMMI), all-cause maternal death and COVID-19-related hospitalization, while secondary outcomes were individual components of MMMI, preterm birth, stillbirth, neonatal death and cesarean section. One-to-ten propensity-score matching was conducted between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir users and nonusers, followed by cloning, censoring and weighting. Overall, 211 pregnant women on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 1,998 nonusers were included. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was associated with reduced 28-day MMMI risk (absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 1.47%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.21-2.34%) but not 28-days COVID-19-related hospitalization (ARR = -0.09%, 95% CI = -1.08% to 0.71%). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was also associated with reduced risks of cesarean section (ARR = 1.58%, 95% CI = 0.85-2.39%) and preterm birth (ARR = 2.70%, 95% CI = 0.98-5.31%). No events of maternal or neonatal death or stillbirth were recorded. The findings suggest that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is an effective treatment in symptomatic pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection.","Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.  carlosho@hku.hk.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS  Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. carlosho@hku.hk.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. carlosho@hku.hk.; Vaccine Confidence Project, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London  School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK. carlosho@hku.hk.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The  University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; School of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS  Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.",10.1038/s41591-023-02674-0 [pii]; 10.1038/s41591-023-02674-0 [doi],Wong CKH; Lau KTK; Chung MSH; Au ICH; Cheung KW; Lau EHY; Daoud Y; Cowling BJ; Leung GM,ORCID: 0000-0002-6895-6071; ORCID: 0000-0002-1669-4479; ORCID: 0000-0002-6297-7154; ORCID: 0000-0002-2503-6283,"© 2023.

39585678,"IMPORTANCE: Clinicians often approach urate-lowering therapy (ULT) cautiously in  patients with gout and impaired kidney function because they are concerned about the risk of progression to severe or end-stage kidney disease. However, evidence from randomized clinical trials of this association remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between achieving target serum urate level with ULT and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to severe or end-stage in patients with gout and impaired kidney function. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cohort study using the target trial emulation approach using data from a general practice database (IQVIA Medical Research Database) for 2000 to 2023. Eligible patients were 40 to 89 years old and had gout and CKD stage 3. Data analyses were performed from November 2023 to September 2024. EXPOSURES: Lowering serum urate level to target level (<6 mg/dL) using ULT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Severe or end-stage kidney disease, determined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 on at least 2 occasions more than 90 days apart within 1 year, or at least 1 Read code (per the Refined Etiology, Anatomical Site, and Diagnosis classification) for CKD stages 4 or 5, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplant. The prespecified noninferiority margin of the hazard ratio (HR) was set at 1.2, comparing those who achieved the target serum urate level with those who did not. RESULTS: Among the 14 792 participants (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [9.5] years; 9215 men [62.3%] and 5577 women [37.7%]) with gout and with CKD stage 3, the 5-year risk of severe or end-stage kidney disease was 10.32% for those who achieved the target serum urate level and 12.73% for those who did not. Compared with those not achieving the target level, the adjusted 5-year risk difference and HR of severe or end-stage kidney disease for patients achieving the target serum urate level was -2.41% (95% CI, -4.61% to -0.21%) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study indicate that in patients with gout and CKD stage 3, lowering serum urate level to less than 6 mg/dL vs 6 mg/dL or greater using ULT was not associated with an increased risk of severe or end-stage kidney disease. These findings support optimizing ULT to achieve target serum urate levels when treating patients with gout and impaired kidney function.","Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha,  China.; Department of Medicine, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.; University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, San Diego.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston.; The Mongan Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School,  Boston.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Xiangya Hospital, Central  South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha,  China.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Xiangya Hospital, Central  South University, Changsha, China.; Key Laboratory of Aging-Related Bone and Joint Diseases Prevention and Treatment,  Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public  Health, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha,  China.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Xiangya Hospital, Central  South University, Changsha, China.; Key Laboratory of Aging-Related Bone and Joint Diseases Prevention and Treatment,  Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha,  China.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Xiangya Hospital, Central  South University, Changsha, China.; Key Laboratory of Aging-Related Bone and Joint Diseases Prevention and Treatment,  Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public  Health, Central South University, Changsha, China.",2826331 [pii]; ioi240077 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.6212 [doi],Wang Y; Dalbeth N; Terkeltaub R; Zhang Y; Li X; Zeng C; Lei G; Wei J,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Dalbeth reported personal fees from  AstraZeneca, Novartis, Horizon, Selecta, Arthrosi Therapeutics, JW Pharma, PK Med, LG Chem, JPI, PTC Therapeutics, Protalix BioTherapeutics, Unlocked Labs, Hikma, Dexcel Pharma, Shanton Pharma, Sobi, Avalo, BioMarin, and Aristea; and grants from Arthrosi Therapeutics and MedCryst Therapeutics outside the submitted work.

40601818,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients are often excluded from pneumonia trials,  guidelines, and stewardship interventions.The objective of this study was to evaluate whether empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment impacts mortality and other clinical outcomes in moderately immunocompromised patients without risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: This was a target trial emulation including moderately immunocompromised (asplenia, hematologic malignancies, solid organ malignancy receiving chemotherapy, kidney transplant >1 year prior, congenital/acquired immunodeficiency and receiving immunosuppressive medications) patients with pneumonia without risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms at 69 hospitals in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety ConsortiumThis study compared the receipt of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics against antibiotics targeting typical respiratory pathogens on hospital day 1 or 2.The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, transfer to the intensive care unit and 30-day readmission, emergency department visit, Clostridioides difficile infection and antibiotic-associated adverse events. RESULTS: Of 2706 moderately immunocompromised patients with pneumonia, 59% (N=1596) received empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. MRSA and resistant gram-negative bacteria were rare (94/2706, 3.5%). After adjustment, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was not associated with mortality, but was associated with readmission (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.32 [1.05-1.66]), transfer to ICU (aHR, 2.65 [1.32-5.30]) and longer hospitalization (adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 1.14 [1.10-1.19]). CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised patients hospitalized with pneumonia often receive empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics despite low rates of multidrug-resistant organisms. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use was not associated with mortality, but was associated with harm, including 30-day readmission, transfer to ICU and longer duration of hospitalization.","Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine,  University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Division of Health System Innovation & Research, Department of Population Health  Science, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Health System, Ann Arbor,  Michigan, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Medicine Service, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Henry Ford Health,  Detroit, Michigan, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Medicine Service, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Section of Infectious Diseases, Trinity Health Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan,  USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, Corewell Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Hurley Medical Center, Flint, Michigan, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan State University College of Human  Medicine, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan  Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.",8182678 [pii]; 10.1093/cid/ciaf344 [doi],Saravolatz L; Gandhi TN; Vaughn VM; Ratz D; Horowitz JK; Gupta A; McLaughlin E; Czilok T; Weinmann A; Paje D; Malani AN; Burdick S; Osterholzer D; Flanders SA; Petty LA,ORCID: 0009-0001-5670-5101; ORCID: 0000-0003-4362-7842; ORCID: 0000-0002-2545-0636; ORCID: 0000-0001-5809-7149; ORCID: 0000-0002-7062-9619,"© The Author(s) 2025.

39001505,"This study follows the Target Trial Emulation (TTE) framework to assess the  impact of unplanned resections (UEs) and planned resections (PEs) of sarcomas on local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Sarcomas, malignant tumors with mesenchymal differentiation, present a significant clinical challenge due to their rarity, complexity, and the frequent occurrence of UEs, which complicates effective management. Our analysis utilized real-world-time data from the Swiss Sarcoma Network, encompassing 429 patients, to compare the impact of UEs and PEs, adjusting for known prognostic factors through a multivariable Cox regression model and propensity score weighting. Our findings reveal a significantly higher risk of local recurrence for UEs and a short-term follow-up period that showed no marked differences in MFS, CSS, and OS between the UE and PE groups, underlining the importance of optimal initial surgical management. Furthermore, tumor grade was validated as a critical prognostic factor, influencing outcomes irrespective of surgical strategy. This study illuminates the need for improved referral systems to specialized sarcoma networks to prevent UEs and advocates for the integration of TTE in sarcoma research to enhance clinical guidelines and decision-making in sarcoma care. Future research should focus on the prospective validations of these findings and the exploration of integrated care models to reduce the incidence of UEs and improve patient outcomes.","Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, University of Lucerne, Frohburgstrasse  3, 6002 Luzern, Switzerland.; Sarcoma Center, LUKS University Teaching Hospital, Luzerner Kantonsspital, 6000  Lucerne, Switzerland.; Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, University of Lucerne, Frohburgstrasse  3, 6002 Luzern, Switzerland.; Sarcoma Center, LUKS University Teaching Hospital, Luzerner Kantonsspital, 6000  Lucerne, Switzerland.; Medizinische Fakultät, Universität Zürich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland.; Sarcoma Center, LUKS University Teaching Hospital, Luzerner Kantonsspital, 6000  Lucerne, Switzerland.; Sarcoma Center, LUKS University Teaching Hospital, Luzerner Kantonsspital, 6000  Lucerne, Switzerland.; Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, University of Lucerne, Frohburgstrasse  3, 6002 Luzern, Switzerland.; Sarcoma Center, LUKS University Teaching Hospital, Luzerner Kantonsspital, 6000  Lucerne, Switzerland.; Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, University of Lucerne, Frohburgstrasse  3, 6002 Luzern, Switzerland.; Sarcoma Center, LUKS University Teaching Hospital, Luzerner Kantonsspital, 6000  Lucerne, Switzerland.; Sarkomzentrum KSW, Klinik für Orthopädie und Traumatologie, Kantonsspital  Winterthur, 8400 Winterthur, Switzerland.",cancers16132443 [pii]; cancers-16-02443 [pii]; 10.3390/cancers16132443 [doi],Obergfell TTAF; Nydegger KN; Heesen P; Schelling G; Bode-Lesniewska B; Studer G; Fuchs B,ORCID: 0000-0002-5090-4935; ORCID: 0000-0002-3329-4186; ORCID: 0000-0001-8780-7701; ORCID: 0000-0001-6453-3947,,,SwissSarcomaNetwork,The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,,2024/07/13 01:22,,20240703,2024 Jul 3,2024/07/13 07:42,,,"Obergfell, Timothy T A F; Nydegger, Kim N; Heesen, Philip; Schelling, Georg; Bode-Lesniewska, Beata; Studer, Gabriela; Fuchs, Bruno",,,13,,2072-6694,2072-6694,2072-6694,101526829,Cancers,eng,10.3390/cancers16132443 [doi]; 2443,20240715,,2024/07/13 07:43,,,,Target Trial Emulation (TTE); benchmarking in healthcare; digital twin in medical research; local recurrence; metastasis-free survival; multidisciplinary teams (MDT); overall survival; planned resection; sarcoma; unplanned “whoops” resection,NOTNLM,NLM,,2024/07/02 00:00,2024/07/13 01:22,2024/07/13 07:43,2024/06/24 00:00 [revised],2024/07/03 00:00,2024/07/13 07:42,2024/05/13 00:00,Switzerland,PMC11240342,2024/07/03,epublish,Journal Article,,,,Cancers (Basel). 2024 Jul 3;16(13):2443. doi: 10.3390/cancers16132443.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Cancers (Basel),Improving Sarcoma Outcomes: Target Trial Emulation to Compare the Impact of  Unplanned and Planned Resections on the Outcome.,,,,16
38582437,"INTRODUCTION: Epinephrine and norepinephrine are the two most commonly used  prehospital vasopressors in the United States. Prior studies have suggested that use of a post-ROSC epinephrine infusion may be associated with increased rearrest and mortality in comparison to use of norepinephrine. We used target trial emulation methodology to compare the rates of rearrest and mortality between the groups of OHCA patients receiving these vasopressors in the prehospital setting. METHODS: Adult (18-80 years of age) non-traumatic OHCA patients in the 2018-2022 ESO Data Collaborative datasets with a documented post-ROSC norepinephrine or epinephrine infusion were included in this study. Logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between vasopressor agent and outcome using two sets of covariables. The first set of covariables included standard Utstein factors, the dispatch to ROSC interval, the ROSC to vasopressor interval, and the follow-up interval. The second set added prehospital systolic blood pressure and SpO(2) values. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis was also conducted and the vasopressor groups were compared using a multivariable Cox regression model. RESULTS: Overall, 1,893 patients treated by 309 EMS agencies were eligible for analysis. 1,010 (53.4%) received an epinephrine infusion and 883 (46.7%) received a norepinephrine infusion as their initial vasopressor. Adjusted analyses did not discover an association between vasopressor agent and rearrest (aOR: 0.93 [0.72, 1.21]) or mortality (aOR: 1.00 [0.59, 1.69]). CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-agency target trial emulation, the use of a post-resuscitation epinephrine infusion was not associated with increased odds of rearrest in comparison to the use of a norepinephrine infusion.","West Virginia University, MD/PhD Program, Morgantown, WV, USA.

38310365,"BACKGROUND: To estimate the causal effect of surgery vs chemotherapy on survival  in patients with T1-3NxM0 pancreatic cancer in a rigorous framework addressing selection bias and immortal time bias. METHODS: We used population-based Danish health-care registries to conduct a cohort study emulating a hypothetical randomized trial to estimate the absolute difference in survival, comparing surgery with chemotherapy. We included pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed during 2008-2021. Exposure was surgery or chemotherapy initiated within a 16-week grace period after diagnosis. At the time of diagnosis, data of each patient were duplicated; one copy was assigned to the surgery protocol, and one copy to the chemotherapy protocol of the hypothetical trial. Copies were censored when the assigned treatment deviated from the observed treatment. To account for informative censoring, uncensored patients were weighted according to confounders. For comparison, we also applied a more conventional analysis using propensity score-based inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: We included 1744 patients with a median age of 68 years: 73.6% underwent surgery, and 18.6% had chemotherapy without surgery; 7.8% received no treatment. The 3-year survival was 39.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 36.7% to 42.6%) after surgery and 22.7% (95% CI = 17.7% to 28.4%) after chemotherapy, corresponding to an absolute difference of 17.0% (95% CI = 10.8% to 23.1%). In the conventional survival analysis, this difference was 23.0% (95% CI = 17.0% to 29.0%). CONCLUSION: Surgery was superior to chemotherapy in achieving long-term survival for pancreatic cancer. The difference comparing surgery and chemotherapy was substantially smaller when using the clone-censor-weight approach than conventional survival analysis.","Department of Surgery, HPB Section, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes and Policy, University of Illinois,  Chicago, IL, USA.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Surgery, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Surgery, HPB Section, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.",7600442 [pii]; 10.1093/jnci/djae024 [doi],Kirkegård J; Gaber C; Heide-Jørgensen U; Fristrup CW; Lund JL; Cronin-Fenton D; Mortensen FV,ORCID: 0000-0002-6994-0637; ORCID: 0000-0001-9738-2284,"© The Author(s) 2024.

39523495,"OBJECTIVES: Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have been the  primary treatment option for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Taiwan since 2010. Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, whereas tofacitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor. The two medications were indicated to treat RA by direct and indirect inhibition of interleukin-6 cytokine. We compared the safety outcomes of tocilizumab and tofacitinib in patients with RA in real-world clinical settings, following the 7 key components of target trial emulation (TTE). METHODS: The data source was the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with RA between 2010 and 2018 were eligible and assigned to either tocilizumab or tofacitinib based on their first prescription of these two medications. The index date was set as the first prescription date of either study medication. Propensity score stabilized weighting (PSSW) was used to balance the characteristics between the two medication groups. The incidences of safety outcomes were all-cause mortality, cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thrombosis events, tuberculosis, joint replacement events, and herpes zoster infection. The intention-to-treat (ITT) effect was commenced from the index date until the study outcomes, independently, 3 years, withdrawal, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first. For the per-protocol (PP) effect, patients were required to maintain the same medical group during the entire follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 2125 patients with RA who were prescribed tocilizumab (n = 844) or tofacitinib (n = 1281) were included in this study. The mean follow-up duration was 2.78 years in the tocilizumab group and 2.83 years in the tofacitinib group. For ITT, the sample sizes were 721 and 1196 for the tocilizumab and tofacitinib, respectively, after PSSW. A substantially lower incidence rate of herpes zoster infection (per 100 patient-years) was observed in the tocilizumab group (3.67) than in the tofacitinib group (7.61), with a hazard ratio of 0.48 (95%CI =0.37-0.63; p < .0001). All-cause mortality, cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, total hip replacement, and tuberculosis were similar between the two medication groups. For PP, the sample sizes were 619 and 1085 for the tocilizumab and tofacitinib, respectively, after PSSW. The results of the PP analysis were similar to those of the ITT analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab and tofacitinib act along the same inflammatory pathway. A lower herpes zoster incident rate was observed in the tocilizumab group than in the tofacitinib group. The incidence rates of other safety concerns and mortality rates were comparable in both groups of patients with RA treated in real-world settings.","Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Department of Internal  Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan  City, Taiwan.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Department of Internal  Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Department of Internal  Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan  City, Taiwan.; Biostatistics Core Laboratory, Molecular Medicine Research Centre, Chang Gung  University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.",10.1111/1756-185X.15406 [doi],Fang YF; Chang SH; Kuo CF; See LC,ORCID: 0000-0002-3449-1704,"© 2024 The Author(s).

40385404,"Target trial emulation (TTE) aims to estimate treatment effects by simulating  randomized controlled trials using real-world observational data. Applying TTE across distributed datasets shows great promise in improving generalizability and power but is always infeasible due to privacy and data-sharing constraints. Here we propose a Federated Learning-based TTE framework, FL-TTE, that enables TTE across multiple sites without sharing patient-level data. FL-TTE incorporates federated protocol design, federated inverse probability of treatment weighting, and a federated Cox proportional hazards model to estimate time-to-event outcomes across heterogeneous data. We validated FL-TTE by emulating Sepsis trials using eICU and MIMIC-IV data from 192 hospitals, and Alzheimer's trials using INSIGHT Network across five New York City health systems. FL-TTE produced less biased estimates than traditional meta-analysis methods when compared to pooled results and is theoretically supported.

40131448,"OBJECTIVE: Preclinical studies in animals have suggested potential  neuroprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), but no epidemiological study has investigated the potential effects of SGLT-2is on epilepsy risk. We aimed to assess the association between use of SGLT-2is and epilepsy incidence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We emulated a target trial comparing SGLT-2is and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) based on the Yinzhou Regional Health Care Database. Cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were new users of an SGLT-2i or a DPP-4i were assembled. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling were applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of the association between use of SGLT-2is and incidence of epilepsy. RESULTS: The final cohort included 24,930 new users of SGLT-2is and 28,924 initiators of DPP-4is. A total of 243 patients with incident epilepsy were found during a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range 0.8-3.3) years, with the incidence of epilepsy being 174.2 and 231.5 per 100,000 person-years in users of SGLT-2is and DPP-4is, respectively. After controlling for potential confounding using IPTW, SGLT-2i use was associated with a lower incidence of epilepsy, with an HR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.52-0.97). Various subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses supported the results in primary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT-2is were associated with a reduced incidence of epilepsy in the study population. More studies are needed to confirm and replicate the study results.","Research Center of Clinical Epidemiology, Peking University Third Hospital,  Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases (Peking University), Ministry of  Education, Beijing, China.; School of Medicine, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.; Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.; Research Center of Clinical Epidemiology, Peking University Third Hospital,  Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases (Peking University), Ministry of  Education, Beijing, China.; Yinzhou District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Yinzhou District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Yinzhou District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Yinzhou District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Research Center of Clinical Epidemiology, Peking University Third Hospital,  Beijing, China.; Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases (Peking University), Ministry of  Education, Beijing, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking  University, Beijing, China.; Center for Intelligent Public Health, Institute for Artificial Intelligence,  Peking University, Beijing, China.",158047 [pii]; 10.2337/dc24-2532 [doi],Zhao H; Zhang B; Zhuo L; Yin Y; Sun Y; Shen P; Jiang Z; Zhan S,ORCID: 0000-0002-4546-9342,© 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.,,,,,2025/03/25 12:14,20250425,,2025 May 1,2025/03/25 18:28,,,"Zhao, Houyu; Zhang, Baixue; Zhuo, Lin; Yin, Yueqi; Sun, Yexiang; Shen, Peng; Jiang, Zhiqin; Zhan, Siyan",,,5,,1935-5548,0149-5992,,7805975,Diabetes care,eng,10.2337/dc24-2532 [doi],20250425,"Humans; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/therapeutic use; *Epilepsy/epidemiology; Female; Male; Middle Aged; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/epidemiology; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Aged; Adult; Incidence",2025/04/25 06:28,,,,,,NLM,827-836,2025/02/27 00:00,2025/03/25 12:14,2025/04/25 06:28,,,2025/03/25 18:28,2024/11/16 00:00,United States,,,ppublish,Journal Article,0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors); 0 (Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors),IM,,Diabetes Care. 2025 May 1;48(5):827-836. doi: 10.2337/dc24-2532.,MEDLINE,Diabetes Care,Association Between Use of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors and  Epilepsy: A Population-Based Study Using Target Trial Emulation.,,,,48
40242567,"Anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies (anti-Aβ mAbs) have received approval  from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (collectively known as early AD) based on evidence from clinical trials. However, whether findings from these trials are generalizable to the real world is uncertain. We need reliable evidence on the real-world safety of these treatments to inform decision making for clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Using lecanemab as an exemplar, we outline the key considerations in designing and implementing an observational study on safety and utilization outcomes using established administrative healthcare claims data sources with the target trial emulation framework. The target trial emulation framework is a rigorous causal inference framework that minimizes common biases in observational studies. The approach proposed here can be applied to evaluation of additional mAbs as they become available. HIGHLIGHTS: Little is known about real-world safety of anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies for early Alzheimer's disease.Existing real-world data can support studies of their safety and utilization outcomes.Target trial emulation can guide the design of these studies while minimizing bias.We provide key design and analytical considerations for future studies.",Department of Population Medicine Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim  Health Care Institute Boston Massachusetts USA.; Division of Health Systems Science UMass Chan Medical School Worcester  Massachusetts USA.; Department of Population Medicine Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim  Health Care Institute Boston Massachusetts USA.; Department of Population Medicine Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim  Health Care Institute Boston Massachusetts USA.; Department of Population Medicine Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim  Health Care Institute Boston Massachusetts USA.; Department of Population Medicine Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim  Health Care Institute Boston Massachusetts USA.; Division of Health Systems Science UMass Chan Medical School Worcester  Massachusetts USA.; Macon and Joan Brock Virginia Health Sciences Eastern Virginia Medical School at  Old Dominion University Norfolk Virginia USA.; Division of Geriatric Medicine UMass Chan Medical School Worcester Massachusetts  USA.,TRC270080 [pii]; 10.1002/trc2.70080 [doi],Li X; Singh S; Rasouli B; Lyons J; Cocoros NM; Platt R; Abi-Elias I; Gurwitz JH,ORCID: 0000-0002-1305-0846,© 2025 The Author(s).

39480503,"KEY POINTS: Patients with kidney failure are at a higher risk of cardiovascular  diseases, but the evidence for statin therapy remains inconclusive. The long-term benefits and risks of statin therapy in patients with kidney failure were analyzed using public electronic health records in Hong Kong. Statin therapy was associated with a lower risk of major cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality without a higher risk of major adverse events. BACKGROUND: Patients with kidney failure are at elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases. Although statins are commonly used to mitigate cardiovascular risk among the population with high risk, the evidence for initiating statin therapy among patients with kidney failure remains inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the long-term benefits and risks associated with statin therapy in patients with kidney failure. METHODS: Using territory-wide public electronic health records in Hong Kong, 3019 statin-eligible individuals with kidney failure and elevated LDL cholesterol ≥100 mg/dl from January 2008 to December 2015 were included for analysis. The framework of target trial emulation was adopted to investigate the risk of the major cardiovascular diseases (i.e., a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke), all-cause mortality, and major adverse events (i.e., myopathies and liver dysfunction) between statin initiators and statin noninitiators. The pooled logistic model was used to obtain the hazard ratio for the outcomes of interest in both intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and per-protocol (PP) analysis. RESULTS: Significant risk reduction associated with statin therapy (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) was observed for major cardiovascular diseases (ITT: 0.78 [0.62 to 0.98]; PP: 0.66 [0.50 to 0.87]) and all-cause mortality (ITT: 0.80 [0.68 to 0.95]; PP: 0.60 [0.48 to 0.76]). The standardized 5- and 10-year absolute risk reduction in PP analysis was 7% (3% to 11%) and 11% (4% to 18%), respectively. No significant risks for the major adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy was associated with lower risks of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in patients with kidney failure without a higher risk of major adverse events.","Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Pharmacy Department, Gleneagles Hong Kong Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, LKS Faculty of Medicine, School  of Clinical Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The  University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, LKS Faculty of Medicine, School  of Clinical Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D 4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong SAR, China.; The Institute of Cardiovascular Science and Medicine (ICSM), Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.",00001751-202505000-00014 [pii]; JASN-2024-000763 [pii]; 10.1681/ASN.0000000554 [doi],Cheng FWT; Xu W; Tang SCW; Wan EYF,ORCID: 0000-0001-7818-1575; ORCID: 0000-0002-6183-571; ORCID: 0000-0002-6862-1941; ORCID: 0000-0002-6275-1147,,,,"Disclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online  version of the article at http://links.lww.com/JSN/E941.",,2024/10/31 12:03,,20241031,2025 May 1,2024/11/03 07:20,,,"Cheng, Franco Wing Tak; Xu, Wanchun; Tang, Sydney Chi Wai; Wan, Eric Yuk Fai",,82222902/National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Excellent Young  Scientists Fund (Hong Kong and Macau)/,5,,1533-3450,1046-6673,1046-6673,9013836,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,eng,10.1681/ASN.0000000554 [doi],20250708,,2024/11/03 07:20,,,,dyslipidemia; lipids,NOTNLM,NLM,882-889,2024/10/28 00:00,2024/10/31 12:03,2024/11/03 07:20,,2026/05/01 00:00,2024/11/03 07:20,2024/06/12 00:00,United States,PMC12059101,2026/05/01,ppublish,Journal Article,,IM,,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2025 May 1;36(5):882-889. doi: 10.1681/ASN.0000000554.

35987402,"OBJECTIVES: To compare mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients under two  low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis strategies: standard dose and variable dose (standard dose increased to intermediate dose in the presence of laboratory abnormalities indicating an increased thrombosis risk). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Target trial emulation using observational data from 2,613 adults admitted with a COVID-19 diagnosis in Madrid, Spain between March 16 and April 15, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,284 patients were eligible. Among 503 patients without increased baseline thrombotic risk, 28-day mortality risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 9.0% (6.6, 11.7) under the standard dose strategy and 5.6% (3.3, 8.3) under the variable dose strategy; risk difference 3.4% (95% CI: -0.24, 6.9); mortality hazard ratio 1.61 (95% CI: 0.97, 2.89). Among 781 patients with increased baseline thrombotic risk, the 28-day mortality risk was 25.8% (22.7, 29.0) under the standard dose strategy and 18.1% (9.3, 28.9) under the intermediate dose strategy; risk difference 7.7% (95% CI: -3.5, 17.2); mortality hazard ratio 1.45 (95% CI: 0.81, 3.17). Major bleeding and LMWH-induced coagulopathy were rare under all strategies. CONCLUSION: Escalating anticoagulation intensity after signs of thrombosis risk may increase the survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

40268291,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Information about the association of glucagon-like peptide-1  receptor (GLP-1RA) with liver and non-liver complications is insufficient in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We conducted a target trial emulation study to evaluate whether GLP-1RA decreases the risk of liver and non-liver outcomes. METHODS: Patients with T2D and MASLD initiating GLP-1RA or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) were included from 2013 to 2022 in Merative™ Marketscan® Research Databases. Primary outcomes included incidences of (1) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis, and (2) cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and non-liver cancer. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline characteristics and Cox regression models were conducted to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat design, GLP-1RA, compared with DPP-4i, had a significantly lower incidence (per 1,000 person-years) of HCC (0.8 vs. 1.7; HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39-0.71), of cirrhosis (29.3 vs. 32.9; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.96), of CVD (57.2 vs. 73.9; HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86-0.95), of CKD (4.5 vs. 6.8; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64-0.84), and of non-liver cancer (16.9 vs. 22.9; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.89). In the per-protocol design, significant inverse associations for these study outcomes still were observed, with HR 0.60-0.77. CONCLUSION: In this emulated target trial of nationwide patients with T2D and MASLD, GLP-1RA use, when compared with DPP-4i, was associated with a significantly lower risk of liver and non-liver complications.","Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University Medical Center,  Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University Medical Center,  Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University Medical Center,  Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University  School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong.; State Key Laboratory of Liver Research, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University Medical Center,  Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto  Healthcare System, Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong.; State Key Laboratory of Liver Research, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.; Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen,  China.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University Medical Center,  Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University Medical  Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA.",cmh.2024.1096 [pii]; cmh-2024-1096 [pii]; 10.3350/cmh.2024.1096 [doi],Mao X; Zhang X; Lai R; Cheung KS; Yuen MF; Cheung R; Seto WK; Nguyen MH,,,,,"Conflicts of Interest MHN received research grants via Stanford University from  Pfizer, Enanta, Astra Zeneca, GSK, Delfi, Innogen, Exact Science, CurveBio, Gilead, Vir Biotech, Helio Health, National Cancer Institute, Glycotest and personal fees from consulting/advisory board from Intercept, Exact Science, Gilead, GSK.

40448382,"INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) of  glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) on the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). METHODS: This target trial emulation study included adults (≥ 50 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and newly prescribed a GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, or other second-line glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs). A doubly robust learning approach was deployed to estimate the risk difference (RD) of ADRD and identify key subgroups. RESULTS: Both GLP-1RAs (RD, -1.5%) and SGLT2is (-1.7%) were associated with a reduced ADRD risk compared to other GLDs. Key subgroups were determined based on cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), chronic kidney disease, and Hispanic ethnicity. Patients with CVD and CeVD had the greatest benefits from GLP-1RAs (-4.8%) and SGLT2is (-4.6%). No overall difference was observed between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2i. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest the importance of personalized treatment in diabetes management regarding ADRD risk. HIGHLIGHTS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), while the protective association varied across subgroups defined by cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Similarly, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) were associated with a decreased risk of ADRD, with the protective association varying among subgroups defined by CVD, CeVD, and Hispanic ethnicity. There was no difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is in the risk of ADRD.","Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Florida College  of Pharmacy, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville,  Florida, USA.; 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), University of Florida,  Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Neurology and McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine,  University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Florida College  of Pharmacy, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Florida College  of Pharmacy, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Florida College  of Pharmacy, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine,  University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Florida College  of Pharmacy, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville,  Florida, USA.",ALZ70313 [pii]; 10.1002/alz.70313 [doi],Tang H; Donahoo WT; DeKosky ST; Lee YA; Kotecha P; Svensson M; Bian J; Guo J,,© 2025 The Author(s).

39515454,"PURPOSE: Pleiotropic cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2  inhibitors (SGLT2i) due to vascular remodeling effects have been demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is unclear whether a similar benefit may be seen for glaucoma. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of SGLT2i on the risk of glaucoma in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Target trial emulation using observational data from multiple healthcare organizations. METHODS: This population-based cohort study included adults with type 2 diabetes in the United States who newly initiated treatment with SGLT2i, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) between 2013 and 2023. Propensity score matching was conducted to control for sociodemographic characteristics comorbidities, and concomitant use of medications. The exposure considered was treatment with SGLT2i for type 2 diabetes, and the outcomes were new-onset glaucoma and its subtypes after initiation of antidiabetic treatments. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of individual SGLT2i on incident glaucoma. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 722,446 patients were included in the SGLT2i arm and the DPP4i arm, respectively. Patients on SGLT2i, compared with those on DPP4i, had a lower risk of glaucoma (hazard ratio [HR] 0.815, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.794, 0.837), including open-angle glaucoma (HR 0.755, 95% CI 0.729, 0.781) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (HR 0.702, 95% CI 0.636, 0.781). Among all SGLT2i, ertugliflozin (HR 0.668, 95% CI 0.512, 0.871) was associated with the lowest risk of glaucoma, followed by empagliflozin (HR 0.727, 95% CI 0.696, 0.759), dapagliflozin (HR 0.814, 95% CI 0.774, 0.855), and canagliflozin (HR 0.893, 95% CI 0.862, 0.926). The protective effect of SGLT2i on glaucoma was validated when compared with GLP1RA (HR 0.932, 95% CI 0.906, 0.959). CONCLUSIONS: Patients on SGLT2i, including canagliflozin, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and ertugliflozin, had a significantly lower risk of incident glaucoma compared to those on DPP4i. SGLT2i demonstrated a protective effect for both open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma.","From Harvard Medical School (K.E.), Boston, Massachusetts.

38909928,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the difference between BNT162b2 and CoronaVac in vaccine  effectiveness and safety. METHODS: This target trial emulation study included individuals aged ≥12 during 2022. Propensity score matching was applied to ensure group balance. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare the effectiveness outcomes including COVID-19 infection, severity, 28-day hospitalization, and 28-day mortality after infection. Poisson regression was used for safety outcomes including 32 adverse events of special interests between groups. RESULTS: A total of 639,818 and 1804,388 individuals were identified for the 2-dose and 3-dose comparison, respectively. In 2-dose and 3-dose comparison, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were 0.844 [0.833-0.856] and 0.749 [0.743-0.755] for COVID-19 infection, 0.692 [0.656-0.731] and 0.582 [0.559-0.605] for hospitalization, 0.566 [0.417-0.769] and 0.590 [0.458-0.76] for severe COVID-19, and 0.563 [0.456-0.697] and 0.457 [0.372-0.561] for mortality for BNT162b2 recipients versus CoronaVac recipients, respectively. Regarding safety, 2-dose BNT162b2 recipients had a significantly higher incidence of myocarditis (incidence rate ratio [IRR] [95% CI]: 8.999 [1.14-71.017]) versus CoronaVac recipients, but the difference was insignificant in 3-dose comparison (IRR [95% CI]: 2.000 [0.500-7.996]). CONCLUSION: BNT162b2 has higher effectiveness among individuals aged ≥12 against COVID-19-related outcomes for SARS-CoV-2 omicron compared to CoronaVac, with almost 50% lower mortality risk.","Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong SAR, China; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; Advanced Data Analytics for Medical Science (ADAMS) Limited, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and  Technology Park, Hong Kong SAR, China; Advanced Data Analytics for Medical Science (ADAMS) Limited, Hong Kong SAR, China; School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong SAR, China; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong SAR, China; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong SAR, China; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of  Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of  Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong SAR, China; Department of Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China; The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, Shenzhen, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong SAR, China; Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, UK; Department of Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China; The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, Shenzhen, China; School of Pharmacy, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macau, China.

39305301,"PURPOSE: The value of adding fusion to decompression surgery for lumbar  degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal canal stenosis remains debated. Therefore, the comparative effectiveness and selected healthcare resource utilization of patients undergoing decompression with or without fusion surgery at 3 years follow-up was assessed. METHODS: Using observational data from the Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study and a target trial emulation with index trial benchmarking approach, our study assessed the comparative effectiveness of the two main surgical interventions for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis-fusion and decompression alone in patients with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal canal stenosis. The primary outcome-measure was change in health-related quality of life (EuroQol Health Related Quality of Life 5-Dimension 3-Level questionnaire [EQ-5D-3L]); secondary outcome measures were change in back/leg pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale), change in satisfaction (Spinal Stenosis Measure satisfaction subscale), physical therapy and oral analgesic use (healthcare utilization). RESULTS: 153 patients underwent decompression alone and 62 had decompression plus fusion. After inverse probability weighting, 137 patients were included in the decompression alone group (mean age, 73.9 [7.5] years; 77 female [56%]) and 36 in the decompression plus fusion group (mean age, 70.1 [6.7] years; 18 female [50%]). Our findings were compatible with no standardized mean differences in EQ-5D-3L summary index change score at 3 years (EQ-5D-3L German: 0.07 [95% confidence interval (CI), - 0.25 to 0.39]; EQ-5D-3L French: 0.18 [95% CI, - 0.14 to 0.50]). No between-group differences in change in back/leg pain intensity or satisfaction were found. Decompression plus fusion was associated with greater physical therapy utilization at 3 years follow-up. CONCLUSION: Decompression alone should be considered the primary option for patients with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis.","Department of Orthopedics, Balgrist University Hospital, University of Zurich,  Forchstrasse 340, 8008, Zurich, Switzerland. ines.unterfrauner@balgrist.ch.; EBPI-UWZH Musculoskeletal Epidemiology Research Group, University of Zurich and  Balgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. ines.unterfrauner@balgrist.ch.; University Spine Centre Zurich (UWZH), Balgrist University Hospital and  University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. ines.unterfrauner@balgrist.ch.; EBPI-UWZH Musculoskeletal Epidemiology Research Group, University of Zurich and  Balgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.; University Spine Centre Zurich (UWZH), Balgrist University Hospital and  University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (EBPI), University of  Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (EBPI), University of  Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Horten Center for Patient Oriented Research and Knowledge Transfer, University of  Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Institute of Primary Care, University of Zurich and University Hospital Zurich,  Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Orthopedics, Balgrist University Hospital, University of Zurich,  Forchstrasse 340, 8008, Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Orthopedics, Balgrist University Hospital, University of Zurich,  Forchstrasse 340, 8008, Zurich, Switzerland.; University Spine Centre Zurich (UWZH), Balgrist University Hospital and  University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; EBPI-UWZH Musculoskeletal Epidemiology Research Group, University of Zurich and  Balgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.; University Spine Centre Zurich (UWZH), Balgrist University Hospital and  University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (EBPI), University of  Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",10.1007/s00586-024-08495-0 [pii]; 10.1007/s00586-024-08495-0 [doi],Unterfrauner I; Muñoz Laguna J; Serra-Burriel M; Burgstaller JM; Uçkay I; Farshad M; Hincapié CA,ORCID: 0000-0003-0116-574X,© 2024.

40381177,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)  infections are limited, with polymyxin B (PMB) and ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) being among the available choices. However, research on these options is scarce and significantly heterogeneous. This study aims to analyze the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of PMB and CZA within a standardized target trial emulation (TTE) framework. METHODS: This retrospective study emulated a target trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of CZA versus PMB for treating CRE infections. Conducted at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, this study included adult patients treated with CZA or PMB from July 2020 to December 2022. Data on demographics, treatment outcomes, and costs were collected. The primary outcomes included clinical cure, incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes assessed 28-day all-cause mortality, microbiological eradication rates, incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and gastrointestinal events. The outcomes were assessed using the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) effects, per-protocol effects, and propensity score overlap weighting (PSOW) methods. RESULTS: Between July 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022, 492 hospitalized patients treated with CZA or PMB were screened at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. Following inclusion and exclusion criteria, 176 patients were included in the mITT analysis, and 153 in the per-protocol analysis. The clinical cure rate was significantly higher in the CZA group compared to the PMB group across all analyses. The 28-day mortality was similar between groups, while the microbial eradication rate was significantly higher in the CZA group compared to the PMB group across all analyses. The incidence of ADRs was consistent between groups, but AKI occurred more frequently in PMB patients, while gastrointestinal events were more common in the CZA group. The CZA strategy demonstrated a 28.1% increase in efficacy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 71,651.76 yuan. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that CZA has a higher clinical cure rate compared to PMB within a standard TTE framework. However, the overall incidence of ADRs was similar between the two treatments. Pharmacoeconomic analysis also indicated that CZA is cost-effective.

40180676,"BACKGROUND: In the context of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), the optimal timing and  criteria for initiating kidney replacement therapy (KRT) remain unclear. This study aims to assess the effect of initiating KRT at various phosphatemia thresholds on Major Adverse Kidney Events at day 30 (MAKE30). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively emulated a pragmatic clinical trial comparing the effect of KRT initiation at various phosphatemia thresholds versus a conventional approach during TLS on MAKE30. All consecutive patients admitted to the ICU at Saint-Louis University hospital in Paris and Angers University hospital between January 2007 and June 2020, presenting with laboratory TLS were included. The design criteria of a clinical trial were mimicked by using the cloning, censoring and weighting method. The primary outcome was the MAKE30 composite outcome, considering only KRT requirement between day 7 and day 30 for the dialysis criteria. We evaluated multiple phosphatemia thresholds to guide KRT initiation, ranging from 6.20 mg.dL(-1) to 9.30 mg.dL(-1). Among the initial population of 220 patients, 192 were included in the emulated trial (median age 60 years old, with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Acute Leukemia being the most frequent hematological malignancies). TLS-related AKI occurred in 140 patients, and 75 patients met the criteria for MAKE30. Regardless of the phosphate threshold considered, KRT initiation based on phosphate level was not associated with a significant difference in the MAKE30 rate. KRT requirement during the first 7 days (Odd Ratio [OR] 4.01 [1.65-4.86], p = 0.003) and non-renal SOFA (OR 1.39 per 1 point increment [1.25-1.57], p < 0.001) were identified as factors associated with MAKE30 (multivariable analysis). CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the strategy of KRT initiation based on a sole critical phosphatemia level in TLS patients.","Department of Medical Intensive Care, Hôpital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.; Department of Biostatistics and Medical Information, AP-HP, Hôpital Saint-Louis,  Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation, CHU Angers, Angers, France.; Department of Medical Intensive Care, CHU Angers, Angers, France.; Department of Medical Intensive Care, Hôpital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.; Department of Hematology, CHU Angers, Angers, France.; Federation hospitalo-universitaire « Grand Ouest against Leukemia », Nantes,  France.; Inserm UMR 1307, CNRS UMR 6075, Nantes Université, Université d'Angers, Angers,  CRCI2NA, France.; Department of Medical Intensive Care, Hôpital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.; Department of Biostatistics and Medical Information, AP-HP, Hôpital Saint-Louis,  Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Medical Intensive Care, Nouvel Hôpital Civil, Strasbourg University  Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; CRBS (Centre de Recherche en Biomédecine de Strasbourg), FMTS (Fédération de  Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg), INSERM UMR 1260, Regenerative Nanomedicin, University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.; Department of Medical Intensive Care, Hôpital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.  lara.zafrani@aphp.fr.; INSERM UMR 944, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France. lara.zafrani@aphp.fr.",10.1186/s13613-025-01439-x [pii]; 1439 [pii]; 10.1186/s13613-025-01439-x [doi],Serre J; Mulier G; Boud'hors C; Lemerle M; Abdel-Nabey M; Orvain C; Chaba A; Biard L; Demiselle J; Zafrani L,ORCID: 0000-0002-7805-3116,© 2025.

40398692,"PURPOSE: The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibitor teprotumumab is  effective for thyroid eye disease (TED), but there is limited evidence on its long-term safety. We studied the long-term cardiovascular, renal, infectious, and safety outcomes of teprotumumab compared with intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids (GCs), oral GCs, and conservative treatment in patients with TED. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with TED who initiated teprotumumab, GCs, or conservative treatment between January 1, 2020, and December 1, 2024, from 80 health care organizations in the United States. METHODS: Propensity scores were used to match baseline covariates including demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data, and medications. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included all-cause mortality and the risks of new-onset cardiovascular diseases, renal diseases, infectious outcomes, and safety outcomes, including hearing loss, within 5 years after initiating treatments. RESULTS: Teprotumumab was associated with markedly lower all-cause mortality (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.65; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10-0.39) and reduced risks of acute myocardial infarction (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.95; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.91), acute kidney failure (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.94; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.63), emergency department visits (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38-0.60; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.75), hospitalizations (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23-0.40; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26-0.45), urinary tract infection (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.89; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.86), pneumonia (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.61; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20-0.53), and severe sepsis (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.64; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.84). There was no difference in the risks of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or inflammatory bowel disease, or complications requiring a hearing device, whereas there was a higher risk of hearing loss after starting teprotumumab compared with GCs (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.67-3.55; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.65-3.44). All-cause mortality was also markedly reduced in teprotumumab-treated patients when compared with patients receiving conservative treatment (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13-0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with teprotumumab compared with IV or oral GCs was associated with reduced risks of death and cardiovascular, renal, and infectious outcomes in patients with TED. Teprotumumab may result in fewer adverse outcomes than systemic GCs for treating TED.

40523289,"BACKGROUND: Reduction of premature death and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is a  key goal in type 2 diabetes management. OBJECTIVE: To compare mortality and cardiovascular event risks in patients treated with semaglutide versus empagliflozin and, secondarily, dulaglutide versus empagliflozin. DESIGN: Target trial emulation studies from observational data comparing semaglutide- or dulaglutide-treated patients with propensity score-matched patients treated with empagliflozin. SETTING: Health care system of 703 academic and community clinical practices. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 45 years or older with type 2 diabetes treated from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2024 with semaglutide, dulaglutide, or empagliflozin. INTERVENTION: Initial treatment with semaglutide, dulaglutide, or empagliflozin. At baseline, concomitant treatment with other diabetes medication was permitted, excluding other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. MEASUREMENTS: A composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke was the primary outcome, and secondary composite outcomes included death or MI, MI or stroke, and individual cardiac events. RESULTS: Patients treated with semaglutide (n = 7899) versus empagliflozin (n = 7899) were followed for a median of 2.2 years; the respective rates of the composite of death, MI, or stroke were 3.7% versus 4.5% at 2 years and 5.9% versus 6.9% at 3 years. Corresponding incidence rates for the composite outcome were 20.99 versus 23.56 per 1000 person-years, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.02). The HRs for the individual outcomes were 0.97 (CI, 0.81 to 1.15) for death, 0.85 (CI, 0.68 to 1.05) for MI, and 0.62 (CI, 0.43 to 0.89) for stroke. Risks for dulaglutide- and empagliflozin-treated patients were similar for the composite outcome (HR, 1.03 [CI, 0.90 to 1.16]) and for death, MI, and stroke separately.

39666579,"OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare the risk of nephrolithiasis among type 2 diabetes  patients who initiated sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) versus dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4is), individually within stone never- and ever-formers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the 2010-2021 Korea National Health Insurance Service database, we conducted a population-based cohort study, comparing initiators of SGLT2is versus DPP4is. The primary outcome was incident nephrolithiasis. Osteoarthritis encounters served as a negative control outcome. After 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching in stone never- and ever-formers, pooled and individual hazard ratios (HRs), incidence rate difference (IRD), and 95% CIs were reported. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, thiazide co-use, and baseline cardiovascular risk were done. RESULTS: The 17,006 PS-matched pairs of SGLT2i and DPP4i initiators were pooled from stone never-formers (105,378 pairs) and ever-formers (11,628 pairs). Over a mean of 654 days, the risk of nephrolithiasis was lower in SGLT2i initiators than in DPP4i initiators: 0.65 vs. 1.12 events per 100 person-years, HR 0.54 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57), IRD -0.46 (95% CI, -0.21 to -0.52). Among never-formers, the HR was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.39-0.48) and IRD was -0.32 (95% CI, -0.27 to -0.36). Among ever-formers, the HR was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.59-0.69) and IRD was -2.26 (95% CI, -1.77 to -2.76). Near-null associations were found for osteoarthritis encounters. Results were consistent across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: We found a lower risk of nephrolithiasis associated with SGLT2is versus DPP4is in stone never- and ever-formers. Despite a greater relative risk reduction in the former, the absolute risk reduction was greater in the latter.","Medical Research Collaboration Center, Seoul National University Bundang  Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.; School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National  University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea.",157601 [pii]; 10.2337/dc24-1652 [doi],Shin A; Shin JY; Kang EH,ORCID: 0000-0003-1010-7525; ORCID: 0000-0001-9697-1159,© 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.,,,,,2024/12/12 13:02,20250427,,2025 Feb 1,2024/12/12 18:23,,,"Shin, Anna; Shin, Ju-Young; Kang, Eun Ha",,#21-2024-0006/Seoul National University Bundang Hospital/; KHIDI-AZ Diabetes Research Program Grant (#08-2022/Korea Health Industry  Development Institute/Republic of Korea,2,,1935-5548,0149-5992,,7805975,Diabetes care,eng,10.2337/dc24-1652 [doi],20250518,"Humans; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/therapeutic use/adverse effects; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/epidemiology; Male; Female; *Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/therapeutic use/adverse effects; Middle Aged; *Nephrolithiasis/epidemiology/chemically induced; Aged; Adult; Cohort Studies; Risk Factors; Republic of Korea/epidemiology",2025/01/22 18:25,,,,,,NLM,193-201,2024/10/16 00:00,2024/12/12 13:02,2025/01/22 18:25,,,2024/12/12 18:23,2024/08/06 00:00,United States,,,ppublish,Journal Article,0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors); 0 (Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors),IM,,Diabetes Care. 2025 Feb 1;48(2):193-201. doi: 10.2337/dc24-1652.,MEDLINE,Diabetes Care,Risk of Nephrolithiasis Associated With SGLT2 Inhibitors Versus DPP4 Inhibitors  Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Target Trial Emulation Study.,,,,48
40329312,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II  receptor blockers (ARBs) are both recommended as first-line antihypertensive agents for patients with diabetes. While pharmacological mechanisms suggest that ACEIs may provide better cardiovascular protection than ARBs, this potential benefit has not been fully established in previous observational studies of patients with diabetes. METHODS: An active-comparator new-user design within target trial emulation framework was implemented using Yinzhou Regional Health Care Database (YRHCD). We compared risks of major cardiovascular events (MACE) between older patients (age ≥ 65 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) newly exposed to ACEIs and ARBs from January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2023. The primary outcomes were 3-point MACE, including hospitalized myocardial infarction, hospitalized stroke, and all-cause mortality (a proxy for cardiovascular mortality). We also assessed 4-point MACE, which further included hospitalized heart failure. Propensity scores were calculated to balance 44 identified confounders. Marginal structure models were applied to estimate per-protocol hazard ratios. RESULTS: A total of 18,558 individuals were included, with 1,641 initiating ACEIs and 16,917 initiating ARBs. Their median age was 72 years and 45% were male. The adjusted hazard ratio for ACEIs vs. ARBs was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.10) for 3-point MACE and 0.83 (95% CI 0.69-0.99) for 4-point MACE. The 1-year absolute risk differences were - 0.30% (95% CI - 1.80-1.21%) for 3-point MACE and - 1.16% (95% CI - 2.97-0.66%) for 4-point MACE. Results were consistent across subgroup analyses (stratified by age, sex, as well as baseline major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, other antihypertensive therapy, insulin therapy, and calendar year) and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with T2DM, the initiation of ACEIs was associated with a trend toward lower risk of MACE compared to ARBs, implying the potential cardiovascular benefits of ACEIs in this population.","Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Peking University, No.38 Xueyuan Road, Beijing, 100191, China.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.; Department of Chronic Disease and Health Promotion, Yinzhou District Center for  Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Department of Chronic Disease and Health Promotion, Yinzhou District Center for  Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Peking University, No.38 Xueyuan Road, Beijing, 100191, China.; Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Peking University, No.38 Xueyuan Road, Beijing, 100191, China. xuyang_pucri@bjmu.edu.cn.",10.1186/s12933-025-02753-1 [pii]; 2753 [pii]; 10.1186/s12933-025-02753-1 [doi],Zeng W; Wang T; Stürmer T; He N; Shen P; Lin H; Guan X; Xu Y,,© 2025.

36752592,"Comparisons between randomized trial analyses and observational analyses that  attempt to address similar research questions have generated many controversies in epidemiology and the social sciences. There has been little consensus on when such comparisons are reasonable, what their implications are for the validity of observational analyses, or whether trial and observational analyses can be integrated to address effectiveness questions. Here, we consider methods for using observational analyses to complement trial analyses when assessing treatment effectiveness. First, we review the framework for designing observational analyses that emulate target trials and present an evidence map of its recent applications. We then review approaches for estimating the average treatment effect in the target population underlying the emulation, using observational analyses of the emulation data alone and using transportability analyses to extend inferences from a trial to the target population. We explain how comparing treatment effect estimates from the emulation against those from the trial can provide evidence on whether observational analyses can be trusted to deliver valid estimates of effectiveness-a process we refer to as benchmarking-and, in some cases, allow the joint analysis of the trial and observational data. We illustrate different approaches using a simplified example of a pragmatic trial and its emulation in registry data. We conclude that synthesizing trial and observational data-in transportability, benchmarking, or joint analyses-can leverage their complementary strengths to enhance learning about comparative effectiveness, through a process combining quantitative methods and epidemiologic judgments.",,7031231 [pii]; 10.1093/epirev/mxac011 [doi],Dahabreh IJ; Matthews A; Steingrimsson JA; Scharfstein DO; Stuart EA,,"© The Author(s) 2024.

39847591,"BACKGROUND: There is limited and conflicting evidence on the comparative  cardiometabolic safety and effectiveness of aripiprazole in the management of severe mental illness. We investigated the hypothesis that aripiprazole has a favourable cardiometabolic profile, but similar effectiveness when compared to olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted an observational emulation of a head-to-head trial of aripiprazole versus olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in UK primary care using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We included adults diagnosed with severe mental illness (i.e., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other non-organic psychoses) who were prescribed a new antipsychotic between 2005 and 2017, with a 2-year follow-up to 2019. The primary outcome was total cholesterol at 1 year (cardiometabolic safety). The main secondary outcome was psychiatric hospitalisation (effectiveness). Other outcomes included body weight, blood pressure, all-cause discontinuation, and mortality. Analyses adjusted for baseline confounders, including sociodemographics, diagnoses, concomitant medications, and cardiometabolic parameters. We included 26,537 patients (aripiprazole, n = 3,573, olanzapine, n = 8,554, quetiapine, n = 8,289, risperidone, n = 6,121). Median (IQR) age was 53 (42-67) years, 55.4% were female, 82.3% White, and 18.0% were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Patients prescribed aripiprazole had similar total cholesterol levels after 1 year to those prescribed olanzapine (adjusted mean difference [aMD], -0.03, 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.02, p = 0.261), quetiapine (aMD, -0.03, 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.03, p = 0.324), and risperidone (aMD, -0.01, 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.05, p = 0.707). However, there was evidence that patients prescribed aripiprazole had better outcomes on other cardiometabolic parameters, such as body weight and blood pressure, especially compared to olanzapine. After additional adjustment for prior hospitalisation, patients prescribed aripiprazole had similar rates of psychiatric hospitalisation as those prescribed olanzapine (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.91, 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.01, p = 0.078), quetiapine (aHR, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.04, p = 0.230), or risperidone (aHR, 1.01, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.12, p = 0.854). CONCLUSIONS: Data from our large, powered, diverse, real-world target trial emulation sample, followed over 2 years, suggest that adults diagnosed with severe mental illness prescribed aripiprazole have similar total cholesterol 1 year after first prescription compared to those prescribed olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. However, patients prescribed aripiprazole had better outcomes on some other cardiometabolic parameters, and there was little evidence of differences in effectiveness. Our findings inform a common clinical dilemma and contribute to the evidence base for real-world clinical decision-making on antipsychotic choice for patients diagnosed with severe mental illness.","Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Expert by Experience, United Kingdom.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, United Kingdom.; Centre for Medicines Optimisation Research and Education, University College  London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science Park, Pak Shek  Kok, Hong Kong.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Statistical Sciences, University College London, London, United  Kingdom.; Department of Public Health and Nursing, Norwegian University of Science and  Technology, Trondheim, Norway.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.",PMEDICINE-D-24-02223 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004520 [doi],Richards-Belle A; Launders N; Hardoon S; Richards A; Man KKC; Davies NM; Bramon E; Hayes JF; Osborn DPJ,ORCID: 0009-0006-3232-7069; ORCID: 0000-0003-4241-938X; ORCID: 0000-0001-8645-1942; ORCID: 0000-0002-2460-0508; ORCID: 0000-0003-2286-3862,"Copyright: © 2025 Richards-Belle et al.

40178454,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and  angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) prevent fibrosis progression in a preclinical model of steatotic liver disease. Our objective was to assess the impact of ACEi/ARB use on clinical outcomes in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using TriNetX, a nationwide database, we identified all patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2019. Using a target trial emulation framework, ACEi/ARB users were matched with calcium channel blocker (CCB) users using propensity score matching (PSM). Patients were followed up to 10 years after the index date. Cox proportional hazards ﻿regression was used to determine the risk of mortality, major adverse liver outcomes, major adverse cardiac events, and incident cancers. Of the 35,988 eligible patients, 28,423 were ACEi/ARB users, and 7565 were CCB users. After PSM, 7238 pairs were well-balanced. ACEi/ARB use was associated with a significantly decreased mortality risk (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.51-0.68). ACEi/ARB was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing major adverse liver outcomes (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61-0.80), including ascites (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63-0.98) and HE (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57-0.78). ACEi/ARB use was also associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.76-0.90) but not incident cancer (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.86-1.10) compared with CCB. CONCLUSIONS: ACEi/ARB use in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases was associated with a reduced risk of mortality, major adverse liver outcomes, and major adverse cardiac events compared with CCB use.

40411755,"OBJECTIVES: Current recommendations suggest treating eosinophilic granulomatosis  with polyangiitis (EGPA) without severe manifestations with glucocorticoids (GCs) and EGPA with severe manifestations with GCs plus cyclophosphamide (CYC) regardless of poor-prognostic factors. However, GCs plus CYC and GCs alone have never been compared in EGPA without poor-prognosis factors assessed by the 1996 Five Factor Score (FFS). We aimed to compare the efficacy of GCs plus CYC vs GCs alone for the treatment of EGPA without poor-prognosis, including among patients with severe manifestations. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using observational data from a European multicentre retrospective study. We included patients with i) newly diagnosed EGPA, ii) a FFS =0 at diagnosis iii) and treated with GCs or GCs plus CYC. Primary outcome was overall relapse at 12 months. Inverse probability of treatment weighting-based analysis was used to adjust for potential confounding factors. In a subgroup analysis, we focused on patients with severe manifestations not included in the FFS. RESULTS: A total of 250 patients were included: 177 treated with GCs alone and 73 with GCs plus CYC. After adjustment, no reduction in the risk of overall relapse was observed between the two treatment groups. Similar results were observed in the subgroup of patients with severe manifestations. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the adjunction of CYC to GCs does not reduce the risk of relapse in patients with EGPA and no poor-prognosis factors. It supports current guidelines in patients without severe manifestations but challenges the need of CYC adjunction in patients with severe manifestations but no poor-prognosis factors.","Department of Internal Medicine, National Referral Center for Rare Systemic  Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Diseases of Ile de France, East and West, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris, France and Paris Cité University, Paris, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, National Referral Center for Rare Systemic  Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Diseases of Ile de France, East and West, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris, France and Paris Cité University, Paris, France.; Nephrology and Dialysis Unit, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Rheumatology, Unidade Local de Saúde do Algarve, Faro, Portugal.; Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Center-University of  Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.; Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Firenze, Firenze,  Italy.; Department of Internal Medicine, National Referral Center for Rare Systemic  Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Diseases of Ile de France, East and West, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris, France and Paris Cité University, Paris, France.; Division of Rheumatology, Geneva University Hospitals and University of Geneva,  Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Internal Medicine, Rheumatology, Pulmonology, Nephrology and  Diabtology and Immunology, ERN-RITA Reference Center, Vasculitis-Center Tübingen-Kirchheim, Medius Kliniken Kirchheim, University of Tübingen, Kirchheim-Teck, Germany.; Department of Rheumatology, IRCCS Policlinico S.

40058388,"BACKGROUND: There remains a scarcity of evidence on initiating statin therapy for  the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases among older adults with chronic kidney disease due to the under-representation of this population in randomised controlled trials. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in older adults (aged 75-84 years) and very old adults (aged ≥85 years) with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Using territory-wide public electronic health records in Hong Kong, patients older than 60 years with chronic kidney disease and with hyperlipidaemia (defined as elevated LDL cholesterol of ≥2·6 mmol/L) were identified for inclusion in the analyses and were included on a rolling basis in each calendar month from January, 2008, to December, 2015. Patients were categorised into different age groups (ie, 60-74 years, 75-84 years, and ≥85 years) for analysis, and the 60-74 years age group was used as a benchmark group to test the validity of our emulated trial since the effect of statin therapy is well established in this age group. The framework of target trial emulation was adopted to investigate the association between statin therapy and the risk of overall cardiovascular disease incidence, specific cardiovascular disease subtypes (ie, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke), and all-cause mortality, as well as major adverse events (ie, myopathies and liver dysfunction). The primary outcome was overall cardiovascular disease incidence. The hazard ratios for the outcomes were estimated by pooled logistic models in the intention-to-treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis. FINDINGS: 711 966 person-trials from 96 trials were eligible for inclusion in the study. 19 423 unique individuals with chronic kidney disease aged 60-74 years, 22 565 unique individuals with chronic kidney disease aged 75-84 years, and 8811 unique individuals with chronic kidney disease aged 85 years and older were identified for inclusion in the analyses. In patients aged 75-84 years, a significant risk reduction was observed for overall cardiovascular disease incidence in both the intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0·94 [95% CI 0·89-0·99]) and in the per-protocol analysis (0·86 [0·80-0·92]) and for all-cause mortality (0·87 [0·82-0·91] in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0·78 [0·72-0·84] in the per-protocol analysis). This risk reduction was also observed among patients aged 85 years and older for cardiovascular diseases (HR 0·88 [0·79-0·99] in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0·81 [0·71-0·92] in the per-protocol analysis), and for all-cause mortality (0·89 [0·81-0·98] in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0·80 [0·71-0·91] in the per-protocol analysis). Substantial risk reduction for myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke were also observed across all age groups. No significantly increased risk of myopathies or liver dysfunction was observed in any of the age groups. INTERPRETATION: Statin therapy is beneficial for hypercholesterolemic older patients with chronic kidney disease aged 75 years and older regarding the primary prevention against cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality, without posing an increased risk of major adverse events. The benefits and safety persist in those aged 85 years and older.

39603638,"PURPOSE: Clinicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on oral  anticoagulants who undergo surgery for chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) face a dilemma: while early postoperative resumption of anticoagulation is necessary to prevent embolism, it may increase the risk of CSDH recurrence. To date, however, no study has evaluated this question while adequately addressing common biases in observational studies. Here, we assessed this issue using target trial emulation framework. METHODS: We identified patients undergoing initial CSDH surgery who had received anticoagulation for AF preoperatively from two hospital-based administrative databases (2014-2022). We compared two treatment strategies: resumption of anticoagulation within 14 days postoperatively versus no resumption during this period. Using a three-step method of cloning, censoring, and weighting, we estimated the risk of CSDH recurrence, along with the risk ratio and risk difference at postoperative day 90. RESULTS: 291 CSDH patients with AF were eligible, of whom 29 (10.0%) underwent CSDH reoperation. The weighted estimated 90-day reoperation risk was 11.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0 to 14.3) for resuming anticoagulation within 14 days postoperatively and 9.4% (95% CI, 4.1 to 12.8) for not resuming within 14 days, corresponding to a risk ratio of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.67 to 2.36) and risk difference of 1.9% (95% CI, -4.0 to 6.6). CONCLUSIONS: 90-day risk of CSDH recurrence may not differ between early and non-early resumption of anticoagulation, although early resumption could modestly accelerate recurrence. Allowing for the imprecision of the estimates, these findings provide important insights for clinical decision-making regarding anticoagulation resumption.","Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Digital Health and Epidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and  Public Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Information and Computer Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo  University of Science, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Graduate School of Public Health, Shizuoka Graduate University of Public Health,  Shizuoka, Japan.; Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, University of Tsukuba,  Ibaraki, Japan.; Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.",10.1002/pds.70063 [doi],Anno T; Fukasawa T; Shinozaki T; Takeuchi M; Yoshida S; Kawakami K,ORCID: 0000-0003-3395-9691; ORCID: 0000-0002-7477-4071,© 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,,,,,2024/11/27 19:53,20241127,,2024 Dec,2024/11/28 00:24,,,"Anno, Takayuki; Fukasawa, Toshiki; Shinozaki, Tomohiro; Takeuchi, Masato; Yoshida, Satomi; Kawakami, Koji",,,12,,1099-1557,1053-8569,,9208369,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,eng,10.1002/pds.70063 [doi],20241202,"Humans; *Atrial Fibrillation/surgery/complications/drug therapy; *Hematoma, Subdural, Chronic/surgery; *Anticoagulants/administration & dosage/adverse effects; Aged; Female; Male; *Recurrence; Administration, Oral; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Reoperation/statistics & numerical data; Time Factors; Databases, Factual; Retrospective Studies",2024/11/28 00:25,,,,anticoagulation; atrial fibrillation; chronic subdural hematoma; real‐world data; recurrence; target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,e70063,2024/11/07 00:00,2024/11/27 19:53,2024/11/28 00:25,2024/11/04 00:00 [revised],,2024/11/28 00:24,2024/07/02 00:00,England,,,ppublish,Journal Article,0 (Anticoagulants),IM,,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2024 Dec;33(12):e70063. doi: 10.1002/pds.70063.,MEDLINE,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Impact of Early Resumption of Oral Anticoagulation on Recurrence After Surgery  for Chronic Subdural Hematoma in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Target Trial Emulation.,,,,33
39847422,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 Canada's Food Guide provides universal recommendations to  individuals aged ≥2 years. However, the extent to which these recommendations are appropriate for older adults is unknown. Although ideal, conducting a large randomized controlled trial is unrealistic in the short term. An alternative is the target trial emulation framework for causal inference, a novel approach to improve the analysis of observational data. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the protocol for a target trial emulation in older adults, with an emphasis on key aspects of a hypothetical sustained diet and physical activity intervention. METHODS: To emulate the target trial, nonexperimental data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge; N=1753 adults aged ≥67 years) will be used. NuAge includes 4 yearly measurements of dietary intakes, covariates, and outcomes. The per-protocol causal contrast will be the primary causal contrast of interest to account for nonadherence. The sustained intervention strategy will be modeled using the parametric g-formula. In the hypothetical trial, participants will be instructed to meet sex-specific minimal intakes for vegetables and fruits, whole grains, animal- and plant-based protein foods, milk and plant-based beverages, and unsaturated fats. The eligibility criteria, follow-up, intervention, outcomes, and causal contrast in the emulation will closely align with those of the target trial, with only minor modifications. We will attempt to emulate the randomization of treatment by adjusting for baseline covariates and prebaseline dietary habits. RESULTS: Data collection for NuAge was completed in June 2008. For this study, the main analysis was started in May 2024. Submission of the manuscript is expected by February 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Emulating a target trial will provide the first evidence of the adequacy of the 2019 Canada's Food Guide recommendations for older adults in relation to health outcomes.

39250114,"IMPORTANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD), a clinically heterogenous genetic  hemoglobinopathy, is characterized by painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) that can require hospitalization. Patients admitted with VOEs are often initially resuscitated with normal saline (NS) to improve concurrent hypovolemia, despite preclinical evidence that NS may promote erythrocyte sickling. The comparative effectiveness of alternative volume-expanding fluids (eg, lactated Ringer [LR]) for resuscitation during VOEs is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of LR to NS fluid resuscitation in patients with SCD and VOEs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study and target trial emulation included inpatient adults with SCD VOEs who received either LR or NS on hospital day 1. The Premier PINC AI database (2016-2022), a multicenter clinical database including approximately 25% of US hospitalizations was used. The analysis took place between October 6, 2023, and June 20, 2024. EXPOSURE: Receipt of LR (intervention) or NS (control) on hospital day 1. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was hospital-free days (HFDs) by day 30. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation was used to calculate marginal effect estimates. Heterogeneity of treatment effect was explored in subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 55 574 patient encounters where LR (n = 3495) or NS (n = 52 079) was administered on hospital day 1 were included; the median (IQR) age was 30 (25-37) years. Patients who received LR had more HFDs compared with those who received NS (marginal mean difference, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6 days). Patients who received LR also had shorter hospital lengths of stay (marginal mean difference, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.1 days) and lower risk of 30-day readmission (marginal risk difference, -5.8%; 95% CI, -9.8% to -1.8%). Differences in HFDs between LR and NS were heterogenous based on fluid volume received: among patients who received less than 2 L, there was no difference in LR vs NS; among those who received 2 or more L, LR was superior to NS. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that, compared with NS, LR had a small but significant improvement in HFDs and secondary outcomes including 30-day readmission. These results suggest that, among patients with VOEs in whom clinicians plan to give volume resuscitation fluids on hospital admission, LR should be preferred over NS.","Department of Medicine, Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of  Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Pulmonary Center, Department of Medicine, Boston University Chobanian &  Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Pulmonary Center, Department of Medicine, Boston University Chobanian &  Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Center of Excellence in Sickle Cell Disease, Boston University Chobanian &  Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Center of Excellence in Sickle Cell Disease, Boston University Chobanian &  Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Pediatic Pulmonary & Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, Boston University  Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Pulmonary Center, Department of Medicine, Boston University Chobanian &  Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Evans Center for Implementation and Improvement Sciences, Department of Medicine,  Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.",2823422 [pii]; ioi240057 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.4428 [doi],Alwang AK; Law AC; Klings ES; Cohen RT; Bosch NA,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Law reported grants from the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) during the conduct of the study.

38851796,"Currently there is a lack of randomized trial data examining the use of the  antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in paediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This target trial emulation study aims to address this gap by evaluating the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in non-hospitalized paediatric patients aged 12-17 years with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection. Among paediatric patients diagnosed between 16th March 2022 and 5th February 2023, exposure was defined as outpatient nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment within 5 days of symptom onset or COVID-19 diagnosis. Primary outcome was 28 day all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization, while secondary outcomes were 28 day in-hospital disease progression, 28 day COVID-19-specific hospitalization, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), acute liver injury, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, 49,378 eligible paediatric patients were included. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was associated with reduced 28 day all-cause hospitalization (absolute risk reduction = 0.23%, 95%CI = 0.19%-0.31%; relative risk = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.56-0.71). No events of mortality, in-hospital disease progression, or adverse clinical outcomes were observed among nirmatrelvir/ritonavir users. The findings confirmed the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in reducing all-cause hospitalization risk among non-hospitalized pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection.","Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. carlosho@hku.hk.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.  carlosho@hku.hk.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS  Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. carlosho@hku.hk.; Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology & Dynamics, Faculty of Epidemiology  and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK. carlosho@hku.hk.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; School of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine,  LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.",10.1038/s41467-024-49235-8 [pii]; 49235 [pii]; 10.1038/s41467-024-49235-8 [doi],Wong CKH; Lau KTK; Au ICH; Chan SHS; Lau EHY; Cowling BJ; Leung GM,ORCID: 0000-0002-6895-6071; ORCID: 0000-0002-2990-0163; ORCID: 0000-0002-6688-9637; ORCID: 0000-0002-6297-7154; ORCID: 0000-0002-2503-6283,© 2024.

38935831,"Rationale: Prone positioning for ⩾16 hours in moderate-to-severe acute  respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) improves survival. However, the optimal duration of proning is unknown. Objectives: To estimate the effect of extended versus standard proning duration on patients with moderate-to-severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) ARDS. Methods: Data were extracted from a five-hospital electronic medical record registry. Patients who were proned within 72 hours of mechanical ventilation were categorized as receiving extended (⩾24 h) versus standard (16-24 h) proning based on the first proning session length. We used a target trial emulation design to estimate the effect of extended versus standard proning on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality and secondary outcomes of ventilator liberation and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Analytically, we used inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) Cox or Fine-Gray regression models. Results: A total of 314 patients were included; 234 received extended proning, and 80 received standard-duration proning. Patients who received extended proning were older, had greater comorbidity, were more often at an academic hospital, and had shorter time from admission to mechanical ventilation. After IPTW, characteristics were well balanced. Unadjusted 90-day mortality in the extended versus standard proning groups was 39% versus 58%. In doubly robust IPTW analyses, we found no significant effects of extended versus standard proning duration on mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.95 [0.51-1.77]), ventilator liberation (subdistribution hazard, 1.60 [0.97-2.64], or ICU discharge (subdistribution hazard, 1.31 [0.82-2.10]). Conclusions: Using target trial emulation, we found no significant effect of extended versus standard proning duration on mortality, ventilator liberation, or ICU discharge. However, given the imprecision of estimates, further study is justified.","Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health.; Outcomes After Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Outcomes After Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Outcomes After Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University Health Network  and Sinai Health System, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Bloomberg School of Public Health, and.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Outcomes After Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, School of Medicine, Johns  Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland; and.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine.",10.1513/AnnalsATS.202404-380OC [doi],Hochberg CH; Colantuoni E; Sahetya SK; Eakin MN; Fan E; Psoter KJ; Iwashyna TJ; Needham DM; Hager DN,ORCID: 0000-0002-4376-5754; ORCID: 0000-0003-2127-3609; ORCID: 0000-0002-8587-8343; ORCID: 0000-0002-1210-9914; ORCID: 0000-0001-8529-0585; ORCID: 0000-0002-4226-9310; ORCID: 0000-0002-5148-4872,,Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2024 Oct;21(10):1385-1386. doi:  10.1513/AnnalsATS.202407-744ED.

36294140,"Carfilzomib is a promising anticancer drug for relapsed/refractory multiple  myeloma (RRMM). However, real-world evidence has only investigated the cardiovascular safety of carfilzomib, and there is a high demand for thorough safety evaluations. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the risk of adverse events associated with carfilzomib in Korean patients with RRMM. We followed up with 138 matched patients with RRMM (69 KRd (carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) and 69 Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) users). A total of 12 adverse events were evaluated. More than 75% of adverse events occurred during the early cycle (1-6 cycles), and the incidence rate showed a tendency to decrease in the later cycle (7-12 and 13-18 cycles). Severities of most adverse events were evaluated as grade 1-2. The KRd regimen were related with significantly increased risks of dyspnea (adjusted HR (aHR) 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-4.16), muscle spasm (aHR 5.12, 95% CI 1.05-24.9) and thrombocytopenia (aHR 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.06). Although the severities were low, carfilzomib has many side effects in treating RRMM; hence, findings on the patterns of its adverse events could lead to both effective and safe use of KRd therapy in real-world settings.","College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul  National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.; College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul  National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.; College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul  National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.; Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101,  Daehak-ro, Jongro-gu, Seoul 03080, Korea.; College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul  National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.; College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul  National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.",ijerph192013560 [pii]; ijerph-19-13560 [pii]; 10.3390/ijerph192013560 [doi],Jang HY; Lee HK; Kim CJ; Yoon SS; Kim IW; Oh JM,ORCID: 0000-0003-2591-7459; ORCID: 0000-0003-4976-3343,,,,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,2022/10/27 01:29,20221028,20221019,2022 Oct 19,2022/10/28 06:00,,,"Jang, Ha Young; Lee, Hyun Kyung; Kim, Chae Jeong; Yoon, Sung-Soo; Kim, In-Wha; Oh, Jung Mi",,2020MFDS171/Ministry of Food and Drug Safety/,20,,1660-4601,1660-4601,1661-7827,101238455,International journal of environmental research and public health,eng,10.3390/ijerph192013560 [doi]; 13560,20240906,Humans; Lenalidomide/therapeutic use; Electronic Health Records; Dexamethasone; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use; *Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/epidemiology/chemically induced; *Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects,2022/10/29 06:00,,,,carfilzomib; real world safety; relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,,2022/10/17 00:00,2022/10/27 01:29,2022/10/29 06:00,2022/10/13 00:00 [revised],2022/10/19 00:00,2022/10/28 06:00,2022/08/03 00:00,Switzerland,PMC9603615,2022/10/19,epublish,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide); 7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone); 0 (Antineoplastic Agents),IM,,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Oct 19;19(20):13560. doi:  10.3390/ijerph192013560.,MEDLINE,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Carfilzomib's Real-World Safety Outcomes in Korea: Target Trial Emulation Study  Using Electronic Health Records.,,,,19
39454630,"AIMS: The benefit of long-term beta-blocker therapy after acute coronary  syndromes (ACS) without heart failure in the reperfusion era is uncertain. Two recent randomized trials found conflicting results. The present study assessed the safety of beta-blocker discontinuation within 12 months following ACS with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥40%. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a multicentre prospective real-world cohort (n = 3762) of patients hospitalized for ACS, patients with LVEF ≥40% and beta-blockers at discharge were included. Patients who continued beta-blockers at 1 year were compared with those who discontinued beta-blockers within 12 months post-ACS using target trial emulation and inverse probability weighting over an additional 4-year follow-up. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of 4-year cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, unplanned coronary revascularization, or unstable angina hospitalization. Of 2077 patients, 1758 (85%) continued beta-blockers and 319 (15%) had discontinued beta-blockers at 1 year. The risk of the primary endpoint was similar in both groups [14.1 vs. 14.3% with beta-blocker discontinuation vs. continuation; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.34, P = 0.91]. Subgroup analysis suggested a higher risk of primary endpoint with beta-blocker discontinuation after STEMI [aHR = 1.46 (0.99-2.16)] compared with NSTEMI [aHR = 0.70 (0.40-1.22), Pinteraction = 0.033], whereas there was no interaction with LVEF (Pinteraction = 0.68). CONCLUSION: Beta-blocker discontinuation within 12 months following ACS with LVEF ≥40% was not associated with an increased risk of MACE compared with long-term beta-blocker therapy. Subgroup analysis suggested potential risk in STEMI patients. Discontinuing beta-blockers 12 months after ACS appears safe in patients with LVEF ≥40%, particularly after NSTEMI.","Cardiology Division, Geneva University Hospitals, Rue Gabrielle-Perret-Gentil 4,  1205 Geneva, Switzerland.; CTU Bern, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Cardiology Division, Geneva University Hospitals, Rue Gabrielle-Perret-Gentil 4,  1205 Geneva, Switzerland.; Institute of Primary Healthcare (BIHAM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43,  3012 Bern, Switzerland.; Laboratory of Population Health (#PopHealthLab), University of Fribourg,  Fribourg, Switzerland.; Center for Primary Care and Public Health (Unisanté), University of Lausanne,  Lausanne, Switzerland.; Cardiology Division, Geneva University Hospitals, Rue Gabrielle-Perret-Gentil 4,  1205 Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Cardiology, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern,  Switzerland.; Center for Molecular Cardiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Cardiology, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern,  Switzerland.; Institute of Primary Healthcare (BIHAM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43,  3012 Bern, Switzerland.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital,  University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Cardiology Division, Geneva University Hospitals, Rue Gabrielle-Perret-Gentil 4,  1205 Geneva, Switzerland.; Cardiology Division, Geneva University Hospitals, Rue Gabrielle-Perret-Gentil 4,  1205 Geneva, Switzerland.; Institute of Primary Healthcare (BIHAM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43,  3012 Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Cardiology, Lausanne University Hospital, Rue du Bugnon 46, 1005  Lausanne, Switzerland.",7841956 [pii]; 10.1093/eurjpc/zwae346 [doi],Johner N; Branca M; Carballo D; Baggio S; Nanchen D; Tessitore E; Räber L; Lüscher TF; Matter CM; Windecker S; Rodondi N; Mach F; Gencer B,ORCID: 0000-0001-8236-1165; ORCID: 0000-0002-8063-7882; ORCID: 0000-0003-3212-1272; ORCID: 0000-0003-1680-0152; ORCID: 0000-0003-0824-3026; ORCID: 0000-0003-2653-6762; ORCID: 0000-0001-9083-6896; ORCID: 0000-0002-8954-9694,"© The Author(s) 2024.

However, the studies that established their benefit were conducted before the advent of modern therapies, which have since then dramatically changed the prognosis. The benefit of long-term beta-blockers in the contemporary era has therefore been questioned. The present study assessed the safety of beta-blocker discontinuation within 12 months after myocardial infarction in patients who did not have severely impaired heart function. Beta-blocker discontinuation within 12 months after myocardial infarction was safe, as it was not associated with a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or death, compared with long-term beta-blocker continuation.

36719738,"BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is recommended for certain hospitalized patients with  COVID-19. However, these recommendations are based on evidence from small randomized trials, early observational studies, or expert opinion. Further investigation is needed to better inform treatment guidelines with regard to the effectiveness of remdesivir among these patients. METHODS: We emulated a randomized target trial using chargemaster data from 333 US hospitals from 1 May 2020 to 31 December 2021. We compared three treatment protocols: remdesivir within 2 days of hospital admission, no remdesivir within the first 2 days of admission, and no remdesivir ever. We used baseline comorbidities recorded from encounters up to 12 months before admission and identified the use of in-hospital medications, procedures, and oxygen supplementation from charges. We estimated the cumulative incidence of mortality or mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with an inverse probability of censoring weighted estimator. We conducted analyses in the total population as well as in subgroups stratified by level of oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: A total of 274,319 adult patients met the eligibility criteria for the study. Thirty-day in-hospital mortality risk differences for patients adhering to the early remdesivir protocol were -3.1% (95% confidence interval = -3.5%, -2.7%) compared to no early remdesivir and -3.7% (95% confidence interval -4.2%, -3.2%) compared to never remdesivir, with the strongest effect in patients needing high-flow oxygen. For mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, risk differences were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that, among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, remdesivir treatment within 2 days of admission reduced 30-day in-hospital mortality, particularly for patients receiving supplemental oxygen on the day of admission.","From the Target RWE, Durham, NC.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.; From the Target RWE, Durham, NC.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.; Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.; Weill Cornell Medicine Center for Liver Disease, New York, NY.; University of Washington, Seattle, WA.; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.; Columbia University Irving Medical Center Department of Surgery, New York, NY.; From the Target RWE, Durham, NC.; From the Target RWE, Durham, NC.; From the Target RWE, Durham, NC.; From the Target RWE, Durham, NC.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC.",00001648-202305000-00008 [pii]; 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001598 [doi],Breskin A; Wiener C; Adimora AA; Brown RS Jr; Landis C; Reddy KR; Verna EC; Crawford JM; Mospan A; Fried MW; Brookhart MA,ORCID: 0000-0001-5568-2510,"Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40415655,"BACKGROUND: Head-to-head comparisons of high-efficacy therapies for  relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are lacking. We conducted a target trial emulation to compare the long-term effectiveness of rituximab and cladribine. METHODS: We estimated the effect of initiating treatment with rituximab versus cladribine using observational data from the Norwegian MS Registry and Biobank at two university hospitals with different treatment strategies. Cumulative incidence and risk differences (RDs) were estimated using weighted Kaplan-Meier estimators, adjusting for baseline covariates. The primary outcome was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity, with secondary outcomes including relapses and safety. RESULTS: The study included 285 patients, 159 receiving rituximab and 126 cladribine, with a median follow-up of 4.5 years (interquartile range (IQR): 4.2-4.7). The 4-year risk of new MRI disease activity was 17% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11-23) for rituximab-treated patients and 57% (95% CI: 44-66) for cladribine-treated patients, yielding an RD of 40 percentage-points (95% CI: 28-50). The 4-year RD for relapse was 12 percentage-points (95% CI: 4-19). The incidence of hospitalizations related to potential adverse events was 6.0 per 100 person-years for rituximab and 4 per 100 person-years for cladribine. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that rituximab has superior effectiveness compared to cladribine during a median follow-up of 4.5 years.","Neuro-SysMed, Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen,  Norway.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.; The Norwegian Multiple Sclerosis Registry and Biobank, Haukeland University  Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Neurology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Psychology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; Neuro-SysMed, Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen,  Norway.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.; Departments of Epidemiology and Nutrition, Harvard T.

40104887,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is unclear if findings from randomized controlled trials  (RCT) of medications for opioid use disorder apply to real-world settings. We estimated the effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) versus extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) on treatment interruption in a RCT and an observational study based on real-world data. DESIGN: Target trial emulation to harmonize the protocol and statistical analyses of X:BOT (target trial) and the observational study (observational emulation). Baseline was randomization in the target trial and medically managed opioid withdrawal (MMOW) discharge in the observational emulation. SETTINGS: X:BOT trial and Massachusetts Public Health Data Warehouse observational data (United States). PARTICIPANTS: The target trial included all X:BOT participants. The observational emulation trial included MMOW discharges from January 2014 to May 2016. MEASUREMENTS: Treatment strategies were BUP-NX versus XR-NTX initiation within 28 days of baseline. The outcome was treatment interruption (earliest of treatment discontinuation, incarceration, MMOW readmission, death). We estimated the 24-week risk and risk difference. FINDINGS: In the target trial, 94% (269/287) and 66% (187/283) of participants randomized to BUP-NX or XR-NTX initiated their assigned treatment within 28 days, respectively. In the observational emulation, BUP-NX and XR-NTX were initiated within 28 days in 9% (5209/59 076) and 3% (1813/59 076) of MMOW discharges, respectively. The adjusted 24-week treatment interruption risks (95% confidence interval) for BUP-NX and XR-NTX were 68% (60%,77%) and 72% (60%,83%) in the target trial [risk difference, -4 percentage points (pp; -17 pp,11 pp)] and 82% (81%,83%) and 93% (92%,95%) in the observational emulation [risk difference,-11 pp (-13 pp,-10 pp)]. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine-naloxone might be superior to extended-release naltrexone in real-world settings where the majority of people struggle to remain on medications for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine-naloxone initiators had a lower risk of treatment interruption than extended-release naltrexone initiators in an observational emulation, but similar risks in a randomized controlled trial, although confidence intervals were wide. Trial participation, study size and residual confounding may explain these differences.","Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston,  MA, USA.; Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical  Center and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical  Center and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical  Center and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of  Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New  York, NY, USA.; Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine,  New York, NY, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New  York, NY, USA.; Division of General Internal Medicine, Center for Research on Health Care,  Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical  Center and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical  Center and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.",10.1111/add.70040 [doi],Lodi S; Yan S; Bovell-Ammon B; Christine PJ; Hsu HE; Bernson D; Novo P; Lee JD; Rotrosen J; Liebschutz JM; Walley AY; Larochelle MR,ORCID: 0000-0002-9419-7830; ORCID: 0000-0003-1707-0761,© 2025 Society for the Study of Addiction.,,,,,2025/03/19 05:13,20250702,20250319,2025 Aug,2025/03/19 06:22,,,"Lodi, Sara; Yan, Shapei; Bovell-Ammon, Benjamin; Christine, Paul J; Hsu, Heather E; Bernson, Dana; Novo, Patricia; Lee, Joshua D; Rotrosen, John; Liebschutz, Jane M; Walley, Alexander Y; Larochelle, Marc R",,K01 DA054328/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States; R01 DA054268/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States; UG1 DA013035/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States; U10/UG1 DA013035/National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)/,8,,1360-0443,0965-2140,0965-2140,9304118,"Addiction (Abingdon, England)",eng,10.1111/add.70040 [doi],20250704,"Humans; *Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use; *Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy; *Naltrexone/therapeutic use; *Narcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use/administration & dosage; Male; Adult; Delayed-Action Preparations; Female; Middle Aged; *Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy; *Opiate Substitution Treatment/methods; Treatment Outcome; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Interruption",2025/07/02 12:30,NIHMS2075251,,,buprenorphine; extended‐related naltrexone; medically managed opioid withdrawal; opioid use disorder; target trial emulation; trial benchmarking,NOTNLM,NLM,1634-1645,2025/02/10 00:00,2025/03/19 05:13,2025/07/02 12:30,,2026/03/19 00:00,2025/03/19 06:22,2024/09/17 00:00,England,PMC12221784,2026/03/19,ppublish,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Observational Study; Randomized Controlled Trial,"0 (Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination); 5S6W795CQM (Naltrexone); 0 (Narcotic Antagonists); 0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)",IM,,Addiction. 2025 Aug;120(8):1634-1645. doi: 10.1111/add.70040.

40069950,"Target trial emulation (TTE) has gained popularity in evaluating treatments and  health interventions. Its application to infectious disease outcomes requires careful consideration, as infectious disease transmission violates the assumption of no interference. Thus, we conducted a scoping review to understand how TTE approaches have been applied to vaccine evaluation. We searched literature published in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science until May 2024, using keywords related to TTE, infectious diseases, and vaccines. Full-text articles meeting inclusion criteria were further assessed for eligibility. Our keyword-based search and citation search identified a total of 241 studies. Of these, 35 original research studies used TTE approaches to evaluate vaccines, predominantly published from 2022 to 2024. The majority (n=32, 91%) evaluated the effect of COVID-19 vaccines, with one study each evaluating influenza, mpox, and rotavirus vaccines. Most studies did not define which of the four effects of vaccination they evaluated (direct, indirect, total, or overall effect), and none incorporated interference in vaccine evaluation. Our review highlights the increasing popularity of TTE in vaccine evaluation following the COVID-19 pandemic. Further discussions are needed to establish TTE approaches to estimating four effects of vaccination, using large, routinely collected data.","Department of Global Health, School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston,  MA, USA.; Department of Global Health, School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston,  MA, USA.; Department of Global Health, School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston,  MA, USA.; Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.",8071274 [pii]; 10.1093/aje/kwaf053 [doi],Komura T; Watanabe M; Shioda K,,"© The Author(s) 2025.

37518087,"INTRODUCTION: Concerns about public health threats have shifted towards  obesity-related, non-communicable diseases in both developed and developing countries. Since 2008, Japan has adopted a nationwide universal screening programme called Specific Health check-ups (SHC) for the primary prevention of obesity-related, non-communicable diseases, namely, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. The effectiveness of SHC has not been systemically evaluated to date. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use the employment-based health insurance database, which includes both records of receipt versus non-receipt of SHC and healthcare claims. The study design adopts the target trial emulation framework to minimise the bias inherent to the observational study (eg, time-related bias and its consequences). The key components of trial emulation-eligibility criteria, treatment strategy, assignment procedure, follow-up period, outcome, causal contrast of interest and analysis plan-are detailed, along with the ideal target trial protocol. Briefly, we will conduct the nested-trial emulation approach that allows multiple trial entries. Persons aged 40-74 years will be eligible if they do not have a documented diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes and a history of receiving SHC at baseline. Participants will be classified according to the receipt or non-receipt of SHC service and followed for a maximum of 10 years until the withdrawal from the insurance plan, the outcome occurrence or the administrative censoring (the end of the available data, expected to be March 2022), whichever comes first. The 10-year incidence of diabetes/hypertension will be compared between SHC recipients and non-recipients using pooled logistic regression with adjustments for baseline confounders. Five sensitivity analyses are employed, including per-protocol analysis, changing eligibility criteria and negative outcome control analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol obtained the approval from Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, Ethics Committee (R2448). The findings will be disseminated to academic conferences, and published in a peer-reviewed journal.","Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan  takeuchi.masato.3c@kyoto-u.jp.; Department of Information and Computer Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo  University of Science, Katushika-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.",bmjopen-2022-070417 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-070417 [doi],Takeuchi M; Shinozaki T; Kawakami K,ORCID: 0000-0002-2990-2687; ORCID: 0000-0003-3395-9691; ORCID: 0000-0002-7477-4071,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

36814050,"BACKGROUND: Food insecurity is associated with many aspects of poor health.  However, trials of food insecurity interventions typically focus on outcomes of interest to funders, such as healthcare use, cost, or clinical performance metrics, rather than quality of life outcomes that may be prioritized by individuals who experience food insecurity. OBJECTIVE: To emulate a trial of a food insecurity elimination intervention, and quantify its estimated effects on health utility, health-related quality of life, and mental health. DESIGN: Target trial emulation using longitudinal, nationally representative data, from the USA, 2016-2017. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2013 adults in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey screened positive for food insecurity, representing 32 million individuals. MAIN MEASURES: Food insecurity was assessed using the Adult Food Security Survey Module. The primary outcome was the SF-6D (Short-Form Six Dimension) measure of health utility. Secondary outcomes were mental component score (MCS) and physical component score (PCS) of the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (a measure of health-related quality of life), Kessler 6 (K6) psychological distress, and Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item (PHQ2) depressive symptoms. KEY RESULTS: We estimated that food insecurity elimination would improve health utility by 80 QALYs per 100,000 person-years, or 0.008 QALYs per person per year (95% CI 0.002 to 0.014, p = 0.005), relative to the status quo. We also estimated that food insecurity elimination would improve mental health (difference in MCS [95% CI]: 0.55 [0.14 to 0.96]), physical health (difference in PCS: 0.44 [0.06 to 0.82]), psychological distress (difference in K6: -0.30 [-0.51 to -0.09]), and depressive symptoms (difference in PHQ-2: -0.13 [-0.20 to -0.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity elimination may improve important, but understudied, aspects of health. Evaluations of food insecurity interventions should holistically investigate their potential to improve many different aspects of health.","Division of General Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine,  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. seth_berkowitz@med.unc.edu.; Cecil G.

38354442,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of commonly used  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for comorbid depression in older adults with chronic somatic diseases by applying a target-trial-emulation framework. METHODS: Danish target-trial-emulation study including 43,061 individuals aged ≥65 years (54.1% females, mean age 77.8 years) with a first redeemed prescription for depression with sertraline (n = 6673), escitalopram (n = 7104) or citalopram (n = 29,284) in 2006-2017. Individuals had cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease (COPD)/asthma, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, or osteoporosis. Outcomes were treatment switching, combination/augmentation, psychiatric hospital contact for depression, and any psychiatric in-patient care. Follow-up was one year and adjusted Cox regression analyses calculated hazard rate ratios (HRR) within each somatic disease. RESULTS: Across all six disease groups and four outcomes, we found that citalopram use, compared with sertraline, was associated with lower risks in several analyses, with statistically significant results in cancer, CVD, COPD/asthma, and diabetes (e.g., HRRs for psychiatric hospital contacts for depression/any psychiatric in-patient care ranging between 0.47 and 0.61). For escitalopram, compared with sertraline, some analyses indicated poorer outcomes with significantly higher risks for combination/augmentation treatment (HRRs ranging between 1.15 and 1.40). CONCLUSIONS: Although observational studies are prone to confounding, these findings indicate clinically relevant differences between the SSRIs, with better outcomes in citalopram users and poorer outcomes in escitalopram users than sertraline, urging the need for clinical studies in this vulnerable patient population.","Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital Psychiatry, 8200  Aarhus N, Denmark; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.

38832710,"We emulated a hypothetical target trial in which hematological subjects cared at  the University Hospital of Pisa (Italy) received or not SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis with tixagevimab/cilgavimab. Subjects who received prophylaxis (cases) were compared to those who did not (controls). The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the subsequent 6 months. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to adjust for confounders. A multivariable analysis was performed to identify variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We recruited 462 patients: 228 received prophylaxis, 234 were controls. COVID-19 was lower in cases compared to controls (16.7% vs 24.8%, p = 0.03, after IPW 14.3% vs 24.6%, p = 0.01). On multivariable analysis, B-cell depleting therapies (HR 2.09, 95%CI 1.05-4.18, p = 0.037) were associated with increased risk of COVID-19, while tixagevimab/cilgavimab prophylaxis (HR 0.45, 95%CI 0.27-0.73, p = 0.001) and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 0.27, 95%CI 0.14-0.51, p < 0.001) were protective.

39011092,"AIMS: In patients with advanced heart failure requiring dobutamine infusion, it  is usually recommended to initiate beta-blockers after weaning from dobutamine. However, beta-blockers are sometimes initiated under dobutamine infusion in a real-world scenario. The association between such early beta-blocker initiation with clinical outcomes is unknown. Therefore, this study investigates the association between initiating beta-blockers under dobutamine infusion and survival outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: This observational study with a multicentre inpatient-care database emulated a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the beta-blocker initiation strategy. First, 1151 patients on dobutamine and not on beta-blockers on the day of heart failure admission (Day 0) were identified. Among 1095 who met eligibility criteria, patients who were eventually initiated beta-blockers under dobutamine infusion by Day 7 (early initiation strategy) were 1:1 matched to those who were not initiated (conservative strategy). The methods of cloning, censoring, and weighting were applied to emulate the target trial. Patients were followed up for up to 30 days. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Among 780 matched patients (median age, 81 years), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.75-1.64, P = 0.59) for the early initiation strategy. The estimated 30-day all-cause mortalities in the early initiation strategy and the conservative strategy were 19.3% (10.6-30.7) and 16.2% (9.2-25.3), respectively. The results were consistent when we used different days to determine strategies (i.e. 5 and 9) instead of 7 days. CONCLUSION: The present observational study emulating a pragmatic RCT found no positive or negative association between beta-blocker initiation under dobutamine infusion and overall survival.","Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto  University, 54, Shogoin-Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-Ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.; Department of Social Epidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University,  Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto 6068315, Japan.; Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Honmachi,  Sakyo-ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto 6068317, Japan.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku  University, 1-1, Seiryo-cho, Aoba-ku, Sendai-shi, Miyagi 9808574, Japan.; University Hospitals Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute, Case Western  Reserve University School of Medicine, 11100 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto  University, 54, Shogoin-Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-Ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.; Department of Epidemiology, Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, Hiroshima  University Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, 1-3-2, Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima 7398511, Japan.",oeae054 [pii]; 10.1093/ehjopen/oeae054 [doi],Mori Y; Inoue K; Sato H; Tsushima T; Fukuma S,ORCID: 0000-0001-7211-8970; ORCID: 0000-0001-9614-8103; ORCID: 0000-0003-0190-7555; ORCID: 0000-0002-8379-8761,© The Author(s) 2024.

40062740,"OBJECTIVES: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated  with increased risk of osteoporosis, and sertraline may be more potent than citalopram in this regard. Here, target trial emulation was used to investigate whether sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram (the S-enantiomer of citalopram) differentially affect the risk of osteoporosis. Subsequently, it was examined whether SSRIs increase the risk of osteoporosis in a dose-response-like manner. METHODS: Danish nationwide registers were used to identify all individuals that initiated treatment for depression with sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram between January 1, 2007, and March 1, 2019. These individuals were followed until development of osteoporosis, death, or end of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for relevant baseline covariates to emulate randomised treatment allocation to compare the rate of osteoporosis for individuals treated with sertraline, citalopram or escitalopram. Subsequently, the cumulative dose of sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram was calculated, and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess dose-response-like relationships with osteoporosis. RESULTS: We identified 27,280, 65,529, and 17,703 individuals initiating treatment with sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram, respectively. There was no material or statistically significant differential risk of osteoporosis between these groups (adjusted hazard rate ratio, aHRR = 0.98 for citalopram versus sertraline and aHRR = 0.94 for escitalopram versus sertraline). The results were not indicative of the SSRIs having a dose-response-like effect on osteoporosis risk. CONCLUSIONS: Sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram do not appear to differentially affect the risk of osteoporosis. The lack of clear dose-response-like relationships suggest that they do not have a causal effect on osteoporosis risk.","Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital - Psychiatry,  Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT),  School of Medicine, Barwon Health, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia.; The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT),  School of Medicine, Barwon Health, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia.; Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital - Psychiatry,  Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT),  School of Medicine, Barwon Health, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia.",S0924270825000031 [pii]; 10.1017/neu.2025.3 [doi],Rohde C; Williams LJ; Berk M; Østergaard SD,ORCID: 0000-0001-9458-506X; ORCID: 0000-0002-1377-1272; ORCID: 0000-0002-5554-6946; ORCID: 0000-0002-8032-6208,,,,,,2025/03/10 09:03,20250512,20250310,2025 Mar 10,2025/03/10 12:31,,,"Rohde, Christopher; Williams, Lana J; Berk, Michael; Østergaard, Søren Dinesen",,,,,1601-5215,0924-2708,,9612501,Acta neuropsychiatrica,eng,10.1017/neu.2025.3 [doi],20250512,"Humans; *Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/administration & dosage; *Osteoporosis/chemically induced/epidemiology; Female; Male; *Citalopram/adverse effects/administration & dosage; *Sertraline/adverse effects/administration & dosage; Middle Aged; Denmark/epidemiology; Aged; *Escitalopram/adverse effects/administration & dosage; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Adult; *Depression/drug therapy; Registries; Proportional Hazards Models",2025/03/24 06:30,,,,Antidepressants; depression; epidemiology; osteoporosis; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,NOTNLM,NLM,e48,,2025/03/10 09:03,2025/03/24 06:30,,,2025/03/10 12:31,,England,,,epublish,Journal Article,0 (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors); 0DHU5B8D6V (Citalopram); QUC7NX6WMB (Sertraline); 4O4S742ANY (Escitalopram),IM,,Acta Neuropsychiatr. 2025 Mar 10;37:e48. doi: 10.1017/neu.2025.3.,MEDLINE,Acta Neuropsychiatr,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and osteoporosis: a target trial  emulation using real-world data.,,,,37
40049928,"BACKGROUND: Whether or not to reinitiate direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in  atrial fibrillation patients who survived an antithrombotic agent-associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) event remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of DOACs after ICH, with the secondary objective to explore the optimal timing of DOAC reinitiation. METHODS: A sequential target trial emulation study was conducted using the National Health Insurance claims data in Taiwan. We included AF patients receiving antithrombotic therapy who later developed an ICH event between June 2012 and December 2018. Post-ICH DOAC reinitiation status was assessed at 6 consecutive 14-day intervals after discharge. We further stratified our analysis using the stroke severity index to explore the optimal timing of DOAC reinitiation. Study outcomes were all-cause mortality, ICH, and ischemic stroke. Adjusted HRs (aHRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: DOAC reinitiation was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality (aHR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.61-0.88) without increased ICH risk (aHR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.81-1.80) compared with no antithrombotic therapy after ICH. The ischemic stroke risk after reinitiating DOAC was similar to that with no antithrombotic therapy (aHR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.47-1.14). Reinitiating DOACs within 14 and 28 days after discharge most benefited patients with low and high ICH severity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: DOAC is associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality. The optimal timing of DOAC reinitiation varies by ICH severity, with later reinitiation recommended for patients with higher ICH severity.","Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan  University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan;  School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan  University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Stroke Center and Department of Neurology, National Taiwan University Hospital,  Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan  University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

40479120,"BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions that are dependent on if-then rules on disease  status or prior treatment information are dynamic treatment decisions. The effectiveness of dynamic treatment strategies is often investigated with real-world data (RWD). As many different therapy strategies can be observed in routine practice, RWD offer great potential. However, RWD are always associated with risks for several biases including immortal time and selection bias. OBJECTIVES: This article shows how to adequately compare dynamic treatment strategies and identify the optimal strategy. A case study is used to illustrate the causal approach described above. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe how the combination of three counterfactual approaches allows causal interpretation of results. We describe causal diagrams, target trial emulation, and g-methods. The described causal approach is illustrated by a case study examining when antiviral therapy should be initiated in treatment-naïve patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. RESULTS: Causal diagrams visualize underlying causal processes. They help to identify parameters that need to be considered in the analysis. Target trial emulation simulates a randomized clinical trial by defining all possible dynamic strategies, copying (""cloning"") patient data, and assigning each patient to each treatment arm. In a causal per protocol analysis, all patients violating the protocol of a given treatment strategy are censored. Informative censoring is adjusted by g-methods. The expected outcomes of each treatment strategy are simulated and compared. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic treatment strategies can be adequately compared using RWD when three causal approaches are combined, and the necessary data are available. These approaches are (1) causal diagrams, (2) target trial emulation, and (3) statistical g-methods.","Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology  Assessment, Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT TIROL - University for Health Sciences and Technology, Eduard-Wallnoefer-Zentrum 1, 6060 Hall in Tirol, Österreich.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Territory-wide electronic health records in Hong Kong were used to perform target trial emulation using a sequential trial approach. Patients (1) aged ≥18 years, (2) with T2DM, (3) with COVID-19 infection, and (4) who received molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of infection between 16 March 2022 and 31 December 2022 in non-hospital and hospital settings were included. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiators were matched using one-to-one propensity-score matching and followed for 28 days. Risk of outcomes was compared between groups by Cox regression adjusted for baseline characteristics. Subgroup analyses were performed on age (<70 years, ≥70 years), sex, Charlson comorbidity index (<4, ≥4), and number of COVID-19 vaccine doses (<2 doses, ≥2 doses). RESULTS: Totals of 17 974 non-hospitalized (8987 in each group) and 3678 hospitalized (1839 in each group) patients were identified. Non-hospitalized nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiators had lower risk of all-cause mortality (absolute risk reduction [ARR] at 28 days 0.80%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-1.04; hazard ratio [HR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.73) and hospitalization (ARR at 28 days 4.01%, 95% CI 3.19-4.83; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.82) as compared with molnupiravir initiators. Hospitalized nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiators had reduced risk of all-cause mortality (ARR at 28 days 2.94%, 95% CI 1.65-4.23; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.80) as compared with molnupiravir initiators. Consistent findings were found across all subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be preferred to molnupiravir for COVID-19 patients with T2DM and without contraindication to either treatment.","Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong  Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of  Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen,  China.; The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation,  Shenzhen, China.",10.1111/dom.15830 [doi],Wan EYF; Wong ZCT; Yan VKC; Chui CSL; Lai FTT; Li X; Wong ICK; Chan EWY,ORCID: 0000-0002-6275-1147,"© 2024 The Author(s).

37884665,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: When studying the effect of weight change between two time  points on a health outcome using observational data, two main problems arise initially (i) 'when is time zero?' and (ii) 'which confounders should we account for?' From the baseline date or the 1st follow-up (when the weight change can be measured)? Different methods have been previously used in the literature that carry different sources of bias and hence produce different results. METHODS: We utilised the target trial emulation framework and considered weight change as a hypothetical intervention. First, we used a simplified example from a hypothetical randomised trial where no modelling is required. Then we simulated data from an observational study where modelling is needed. We demonstrate the problems of each of these methods and suggest a strategy. INTERVENTIONS: weight loss/gain vs maintenance. RESULTS: The recommended method defines time-zero at enrolment, but adjustment for confounders (or exclusion of individuals based on levels of confounders) should be performed both at enrolment and the 1st follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of our suggested method [adjusting for (or excluding based on) confounders measured both at baseline and the 1st follow-up] can help researchers attenuate bias by avoiding some common pitfalls. Other methods that have been widely used in the past to estimate the effect of weight change on a health outcome are more biased. However, two issues remain (i) the exposure is not well-defined as there are different ways of changing weight (however we tried to reduce this problem by excluding individuals who develop a chronic disease); and (ii) immortal time bias, which may be small if the time to first follow up is short.","MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science,  University College London, London, UK. m.katsoulis@ucl.ac.uk.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Inequalities in Cancer Outcomes Network, Department of Non-communicable Disease  Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; AstraZeneca, London, UK.; Department of Applied Health Research, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK.; Barts Health NHS Trust, The Royal London Hospital, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Alan Turing Institute, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial  College London, London, UK.; Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Ioannina School of  Medicine, Ioannina, Greece.; Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.; Inequalities in Cancer Outcomes Network, Department of Non-communicable Disease  Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool,  UK.; Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool,  UK.; Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,  London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Dept of Statistical Science, Faculty of Maths & Physical Sciences, University  College London, London, UK.",10.1038/s41366-023-01396-0 [pii]; 1396 [pii]; 10.1038/s41366-023-01396-0 [doi],Katsoulis M; Lai AG; Kipourou DK; Gomes M; Banerjee A; Denaxas S; Lumbers RT; Tsilidis K; Kostara M; Belot A; Dale C; Sofat R; Leyrat C; Hemingway H; Diaz-Ordaz K,ORCID: 0000-0002-1756-9530; ORCID: 0000-0001-8960-8095; ORCID: 0000-0001-8741-3411; ORCID: 0000-0002-9077-4741; ORCID: 0000-0002-8452-8472,© 2023.

39097255,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested an association between cataract surgery  and retinal vascular occlusion. However, the association may be attributable to detection bias because postoperative monitoring may be more frequent for those who receive cataract surgery than for those who do not. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study using target trial emulation framework. METHODS: We included patients with cataract aged 50 years and older receiving cataract surgery or nonsurgical interventions identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 2003 and 2018, matched by propensity score. The primary outcome was retinal vascular occlusion. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare surgery and control groups. Additional analyses were restricted to patients who had undergone fundoscopic examination within 6 months prior to cataract surgery to address the issue of detection bias. RESULTS: We included 577,129 cataract surgery and control pairs. We found the hazard ratio (HR) for retinal vascular occlusion after cataract surgery was 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-1.29), compared with the control group. Secondary outcome analyses yielded similar results for retinal artery occlusion (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.26) and retinal vein occlusion (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.20-1.33). However, no risk of retinal vascular occlusion was observed among patients who had received fundoscopic examinations (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.98-1.15) at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscored the importance of conducting complete baseline fundoscopic examinations before cataract surgery to clarify whether postoperative conditions are due to patients' underlying diseases or unintended complications of cataract surgery.","From the Department of Ophthalmology (L.W., Y.S., S.H., Y.H., J.H.), National  Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center (A.Y., C.L., S.S., J.H., E.L.), National Cheng Kung  University, Tainan, Taiwan; School of Pharmacy (A.Y., C.L., S.S., E.L.), Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; From the Department of Ophthalmology (L.W., Y.S., S.H., Y.H., J.H.), National  Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; From the Department of Ophthalmology (L.W., Y.S., S.H., Y.H., J.H.), National  Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; From the Department of Ophthalmology (L.W., Y.S., S.H., Y.H., J.H.), National  Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center (A.Y., C.L., S.S., J.H., E.L.), National Cheng Kung  University, Tainan, Taiwan; School of Pharmacy (A.Y., C.L., S.S., E.L.), Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Dermatology (C.L.), National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center (A.Y., C.L., S.S., J.H., E.L.), National Cheng Kung  University, Tainan, Taiwan; School of Pharmacy (A.Y., C.L., S.S., E.L.), Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacy (S.S.), Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy Systems (S.L.), Outcomes and Policy College of Pharmacy,  University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; From the Department of Ophthalmology (L.W., Y.S., S.H., Y.H., J.H.), National  Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Population Health Data Center (A.Y., C.L., S.S., J.H., E.L.), National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine (J.H.), College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan..

34180721,"Concomitant with expanded legalization, cannabis is increasingly used to treat  chronic pain among persons with HIV (PWH), despite equivocal benefit in research limited by small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. To address these limitations, among a sample of PWH with pain interference enrolled in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, we performed a target trial emulation study to compare the impact of four cannabis use strategies on pain interference. Among those receiving long-term opioid therapy (LTOT), we also explored impact of these strategies on ≥ 25% LTOT dose reduction. Among the analytic sample (N = 1284), the majority were men with a mean age of 50. Approximately 31% used cannabis and 12% received LTOT at baseline. Adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, cannabis use in any of 4 longitudinal patterns was not associated with resolved pain interference over 12- to 24-month follow-up. Among 153 participants receiving LTOT at baseline, cannabis use at both baseline and follow-up was negatively associated with LTOT dose reduction compared to no use at both baseline and follow-up. These findings support other observational studies finding no association between cannabis use and improved chronic pain or LTOT reduction among PWH.","VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.; Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence,  RI, USA.; Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Kentucky College of Public Health,  Lexington, KY, USA.; Center on Drug and Alcohol Research, Department of Behavioral Science, University  of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA.; VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.; Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence,  RI, USA.; Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, Yale School of Public Health, New  Haven, CT, USA.",10.1080/09540121.2021.1944597 [doi],Becker WC; Li Y; Caniglia EC; Vickers-Smith R; Feinberg T; Marshall BDL; Edelman EJ,ORCID: 0000-0002-0788-1467; ORCID: 0000-0002-0134-7052,,,,Declaration of interest statement The authors have no conflicts of interest to  report.,,2021/06/28 12:14,20220405,20210628,2022 Apr,2021/06/29 06:00,,,"Becker, William C; Li, Yu; Caniglia, Ellen C; Vickers-Smith, Rachel; Feinberg, Termeh; Marshall, Brandon D L; Edelman, E Jennifer",,R01 DA040471/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States; U01 AA020790/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States,4,,1360-0451,0954-0121,0954-0121,8915313,AIDS care,eng,10.1080/09540121.2021.1944597 [doi],20230828,"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use; *Cannabis; *Chronic Pain/complications/drug therapy; Cohort Studies; Female; *HIV Infections/complications/drug therapy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prescriptions",2022/04/05 06:00,NIHMS1718867,,,Chronic pain; cannabis use; long-term opioid therapy; target trial emulation study,NOTNLM,NLM,469-477,,2021/06/28 12:14,2022/04/05 06:00,,2023/08/25 00:00,2021/06/29 06:00,,England,PMC10450359,2023/08/25,ppublish,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","0 (Analgesics, Opioid)",IM,,AIDS Care. 2022 Apr;34(4):469-477. doi: 10.1080/09540121.2021.1944597.

37755835,"IMPORTANCE: Antidepressants are increasingly prescribed to pediatric patients  with unipolar depression, but little is known about the risk of treatment-emergent mania. Previous research suggests pediatric patients may be particularly vulnerable to this adverse outcome. OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether pediatric patients treated with antidepressants have an increased incidence of mania/hypomania compared with patients not treated with antidepressants and to identify patient characteristics associated with the risk of mania/hypomania. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a cohort study applying the target trial emulation framework, nationwide inpatient and outpatient care in Sweden from July 1, 2006, to December 31, 2019, was evaluated. Follow-up was conducted for 12 and 52 weeks after treatment initiation, with administrative follow-up ending December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed between May 1, 2022, and June 28, 2023. Individuals aged 4 to 17 years with a diagnosis of depression, but without a prior diagnosis of mania/hypomania, bipolar disorder, or psychosis or treatment with mood stabilizer (lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine), prescriptions were included. EXPOSURES: The treatment group included patients who initiated any antidepressant medication within 90 days of diagnosis. The control group included patients who did not initiate antidepressants within 90 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnosis of mania/hypomania or initiation of mood stabilizer therapy. Incidences were estimated with Kaplan-Meier estimator, and inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for group differences at baseline. RESULTS: The cohort included 43 677 patients (28 885 [66%] girls); 24 573 in the treatment group and 19 104 in the control group. The median age was 15 (IQR, 14-16) years. The outcome occurred in 96 individuals by 12 weeks and in 291 by 52 weeks. The cumulative incidence of mania was 0.26% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.33%) in the treatment group and 0.20% (95% CI, 0.13%-0.27%) in the control group at 12 weeks, with a risk difference of 0.06% (95% CI, -0.04% to 0.16%). At 52 weeks, the cumulative incidence was 0.79% (95% CI, 0.68%-0.91%) in the treatment group and 0.52% (95% CI, 0.40%-0.63%) in the control group (risk difference, 0.28%; 95% CI, 0.12%-0.44%). Hospitalizations, parental bipolar disorder, and use of antipsychotics and antiepileptics were the most important predictors of mania/hypomania by 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: This cohort study found no evidence of treatment-emergent mania/hypomania by 12 weeks in children and adolescents. This corresponds to the time frame for antidepressants to exert their psychotropic effect. A small risk difference was found only with longer follow-up. Certain patient characteristics were associated with mania/hypomania, which warrants clinical attention.","Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford,  United Kingdom.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institute,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg  University, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.",2809866 [pii]; yoi230074 [pii]; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.3555 [doi],Virtanen S; Lagerberg T; Takami Lageborn C; Kuja-Halkola R; Brikell I; Matthews AA; Lichtenstein P; D'Onofrio BM; Landén M; Chang Z,,,JAMA Psychiatry. 2024 Jan 1;81(1):13-14. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.3525.

35764205,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the real-world effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in  patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) by replicating a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design in an observational study. METHOD: This study emulated a target trial using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Eligible participants were ≥45 years, had symptomatic KOA and did not take vitamin D supplements in the past 30 days. A participant can enter the trial more than once. Participants were included in vitamin D group if they took ≥1,000 IU/day for ≥4 days/week in the past 30 days at the first follow-up visit after baseline. The control group did not use vitamin D in the past 30 days. Optimal propensity score matching at 1:1 ratio was performed. The primary outcome was change in knee pain 2 years after baseline measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes included WOMAC physical function and quantitative joint space width (JSW). Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to compare the findings with previous RCTs. RESULTS: A total of 236 person-trials in the vitamin D group were pair-matched with a control. Compared to the control group, vitamin D supplementation did not reach significant changes in WOMAC pain (SMD = -0.04, 95%CI [-0.21, 0.13]), physical function and radiographic JSW over 2 years. The SMDs were consistent with the effect sizes reported in previous RCTs. CONCLUSION: Target trial emulation in the OAI cohort demonstrated findings close to published RCTs. This supports the future use of target trial emulation in evaluating other systemic therapies for KOA.","Centre for Big Data Research in Health, University of New South Wales, Australia;  Sydney Musculoskeletal Health, Kolling Institute, The University of Sydney, Australia.

39985508,"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the leading cause of valvular heart  disease-related morbidity and mortality, but there are no medical treatments to slow its progression. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have pleiotropic effects which could be disease modifying in AS. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine if SGLT2i usage is associated with slower progression of AS. METHODS: A target trial emulation comparing the effect of the initiation of SGLT2i compared with no SGLT2i in patients with nonsevere AS was performed using retrospective electronic medical record data from the Yale New Haven Health System from January 2016 to September 2022. Patients with native aortic valve sclerosis or nonsevere AS with at least 12 months of echocardiographic follow-up were included. Patients were excluded if they had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or had initiated SGLT2i >1 year before the index echocardiogram. The prespecified primary outcome was progression to severe AS. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients prescribed SGLT2i and 11,240 patients never prescribed SGLT2i were included. Patients were on SGLT2i for a median of 0.9 years. Patients on SGLT2i were younger and had higher rates of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Patients on SGLT2i were more likely to have ejection fraction ≤40%. There were no differences between groups in baseline AS severity (66% sclerosis, 23% mild stenosis, and 11% moderate in overall cohort). Patients ever prescribed SGLT2i were less likely to progress to severe AS (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.39-0.94; P = 0.03) with a progressively lower risk among patients on SGLT2i for >3, 6, and 12 months (HR: 0.54, 0.48, and 0.27, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective, multicenter, observational study suggests that SGLT2i may slow the progression of nonsevere AS.","The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA;  Yale Cardiovascular Research Group, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Yale Cardiovascular Research Group, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA.; The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Yale Cardiovascular Research Group, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg,  Gothenburg, Sweden; Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg,  Gothenburg, Sweden.; School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow, Glasgow,  United Kingdom.; Yale Cardiovascular Research Group, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Yale Cardiovascular Research Group, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Yale Cardiovascular Research Group, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Yale Cardiovascular Research Group, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.

37398261,"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 has placed a monumental burden on the health care system  globally. Although no longer a public health emergency, there is still a pressing need for effective treatments to prevent hospitalization and death. Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) is a promising and potentially effective antiviral that has received emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA. OBJECTIVE: Determine real world effectiveness of Paxlovid nationwide and investigate disparities between treated and untreated eligible patients. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study emulating a target trial, using inverse probability weighted models to balance treated and untreated groups on baseline confounders. Participants were patients with a SARS-CoV-2 positive test or diagnosis (index) date between December 2021 and February 2023 selected from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database who were eligible for Paxlovid treatment. Namely, adults with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness, no contraindicated medical conditions, not using one or more strictly contraindicated medications, and not hospitalized within three days of index. From this cohort we identified patients who were treated with Paxlovid within 5 days of positive test or diagnosis (n = 98,060) and patients who either did not receive Paxlovid or were treated outside the 5-day window (n = 913,079 never treated; n = 1,771 treated after 5 days). EXPOSURES: Treatment with Paxlovid within 5 days of positive COVID-19 test or diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalization and death in the 28 days following COVID-19 index date. RESULTS: A total of 1,012,910 COVID-19 positive patients at risk for severe COVID-19 were included, 9.7% of whom were treated with Paxlovid. Uptake varied widely by geographic region and timing, with top adoption areas near 50% and bottom near 0%. Adoption increased rapidly after EUA, reaching steady state by 6/2022. Participants who were treated with Paxlovid had a 26% (RR, 0.742; 95% CI, 0.689-0.812) reduction in hospitalization risk and 73% (RR, 0.269, 95% CI, 0.179-0.370) reduction in mortality risk in the 28 days following COVID-19 index date. CONCLUSIONS/RELEVANCE: Paxlovid is effective in preventing hospitalization and death in at-risk COVID-19 patients. These results were robust to a large number of sensitivity considerations. DISCLOSURE: The authors report no disclosures. KEY POINTS: Question: Is treatment with Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) associated with a reduction in 28-day hospitalization and mortality in patients at risk for severe COVID-19? Findings: In this multi-institute retrospective cohort study of 1,012,910 patients, Paxlovid treatment within 5 days after COVID-19 diagnosis reduced 28-day hospitalization and mortality by 26% and 73% respectively, compared to no treatment with Paxlovid within 5 days. Paxlovid uptake was low overall (9.7%) and highly variable. Meaning: In Paxlovid-eligible patients, treatment was associated with decreased risk of hospitalization and death. Results align with prior randomized trials and observational studies, thus supporting the real-world effectiveness of Paxlovid.",,2023.05.26.23290602 [pii]; 10.1101/2023.05.26.23290602 [doi],Hansen K; Makkar SR; Sahner D; Fessel J; Hotaling N; Sidky H,ORCID: 0000-0001-7399-7911; ORCID: 0000-0003-2403-2472; ORCID: 0000-0002-4616-1171; ORCID: 0000-0003-0797-7693; ORCID: 0000-0001-8423-6464; ORCID: 0000-0003-3532-4809,,,,,,2023/07/03 11:44,,20230603,2023 Jun 3,2023/07/03 13:05,,,"Hansen, Kristen; Makkar, Steve R; Sahner, David; Fessel, Josh; Hotaling, Nathan; Sidky, Hythem",,,,,,,,101767986,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,eng,2023.05.26.23290602 [pii]; 10.1101/2023.05.26.23290602 [doi],20230704,,2023/07/03 13:06,,,,,,NLM,,,2023/07/03 11:44,2023/07/03 13:06,,2023/06/30 00:00,2023/07/03 13:05,,United States,PMC10312865,2023/06/30,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,medRxiv [Preprint]. 2023 Jun 3:2023.05.26.23290602. doi:  10.1101/2023.05.26.23290602.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,medRxiv,Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) effectiveness against hospitalization and death  in N3C: A target trial emulation study.,,,,

36913693,"BACKGROUND: Whether hospitalized patients benefit from COVID-19 oral antivirals  is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the real-world effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the Omicron outbreak. DESIGN: Target trial emulation study. SETTING: Electronic health databases in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: The molnupiravir emulated trial included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or older between 26 February and 18 July 2022 (n = 16 495). The nirmatrelvir-ritonavir emulated trial included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or older between 16 March and 18 July 2022 (n = 7119). INTERVENTION: Initiation of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of hospitalization with COVID-19 versus no initiation of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. MEASUREMENTS: Effectiveness against all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or use of ventilatory support within 28 days. RESULTS: The use of oral antivirals in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was associated with a lower risk for all-cause mortality (molnupiravir: hazard ratio [HR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.93]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 0.77 [CI, 0.66 to 0.90]) but no significant risk reduction in terms of ICU admission (molnupiravir: HR, 1.02 [CI, 0.76 to 1.36]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 1.08 [CI, 0.58 to 2.02]) or the need for ventilatory support (molnupiravir: HR, 1.07 [CI, 0.89 to 1.30]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 1.03 [CI, 0.70 to 1.52]). There was no significant interaction between drug treatment and the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, thereby supporting the effectiveness of oral antivirals regardless of vaccination status. No significant interaction between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment and age, sex, or Charlson Comorbidity Index was observed, whereas molnupiravir tended to be more effective in older people. LIMITATION: The outcome of ICU admission or need for ventilatory support may not capture all severe COVID-19 cases; unmeasured confounders, such as obesity and health behaviors, may exist. CONCLUSION: Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced all-cause mortality in both vaccinated and unvaccinated hospitalized patients. No significant reduction in ICU admission or the need for ventilatory support was observed.

35952768,"BACKGROUND: The inhaled vasodilators nitric oxide and epoprostenol may be  initiated to improve oxygenation in mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory failure (ARF); however, practice patterns and head-to-head comparisons of effectiveness are unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the practice patterns and comparative effectiveness for inhaled nitric oxide and epoprostenol in severe ARF? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a large US database (Premier Healthcare Database), we identified adult patients with ARF or ARDS who were mechanically ventilated and started on inhaled nitric oxide, epoprostenol, or both. Leveraging large hospital variation in the choice of initial inhaled vasodilator, we compared the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide with that of epoprostenol by limiting analysis to patients admitted to hospitals that exclusively used either inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol. The primary outcome of successful extubation was modeled using multivariate Fine-Grey competing risk (death or hospice discharge) time-to-event models. RESULTS: Among 11,200 patients (303 hospitals), 6,366 patients (56.8%) received inhaled nitric oxide first, 4,720 patients (42.1%) received inhaled epoprostenol first, and 114 patients (1.0%) received both therapies on the same day. One hundred four hospitals (34.3%; 1,666 patients) exclusively used nitric oxide and 118 hospitals (38.9%; 1,812 patients) exclusively used epoprostenol. No differences were found in the likelihood of successful extubation between patients admitted to nitric oxide-only hospitals vs those admitted to epoprostenol-only hospitals (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80-1.18). Also no differences were found in total hospital costs or death. Results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Large variation exists in the use of initial inhaled vasodilator for respiratory failure across US hospitals. Comparative effectiveness analyses identified no differences in outcomes based on inhaled vasodilator type.","Pulmonary Center, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine,  Boston, MA.

The study was conducted among adults with T2D and CKD initiating SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021, with follow-up until December 31, 2022. The study was conducted at the Chang Gung Medical Foundation, the largest multi-institutional hospital system in Taiwan. EXPOSURES: Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of anemia outcomes, including anemia event occurrence (hemoglobin level <12-13 g/dL or International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes) or anemia treatment initiation. Changes in hematological parameters, including hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, and red blood cell count, were evaluated during the follow-up period for as long as 3 years. RESULTS: The cohort included a total of 13 799 patients with T2D and CKD, initiating SGLT2 inhibitors (12 331 patients; mean [SD] age, 62.4 [12.3] years; 7548 [61.2%] male) or GLP-1 RAs (1468 patients; mean [SD] age, 61.5 [13.3] years; 900 [61.3%] male). After the median follow-up period of 2.5 years, patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors had lower incidence of composite anemia outcomes (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.90) compared with those receiving GLP-1 RAs. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower incidence of anemia events (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71-0.87) but not with a lower rate of anemia treatment initiation (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83-1.19). Changes in hematological parameters for SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs throughout the 3-year follow-up period supported the primary analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multi-institutional cohort study with target trial emulation, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a decreased risk of composite anemia outcomes, especially anemia event occurrences. SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered as an adjunct therapy to reduce anemia incidence in patients with T2D and CKD.","School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung  University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung  University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.",2815525 [pii]; zoi240066 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0946 [doi],Hu JC; Shao SC; Tsai DH; Chuang AT; Liu KH; Lai EC,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.,,2024/03/04 11:33,20240305,20240304,2024 Mar 4,2024/03/04 12:45,,,"Hu, Jia-Chian; Shao, Shih-Chieh; Tsai, Daniel Hsiang-Te; Chuang, Albert Tzu-Ming; Liu, Kuan-Hung; Lai, Edward Chia-Cheng",,,3,,2574-3805,2574-3805,,101729235,JAMA network open,eng,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0946 [doi]; e240946,20241028,"Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; *Anemia/epidemiology; Cohort Studies; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/drug therapy; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Hemoglobins; *Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/epidemiology; Retrospective Studies; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use; *Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists/adverse effects/therapeutic use",2024/03/05 06:46,,,,,,NLM,e240946,,2024/03/04 11:33,2024/03/05 06:46,,2024/03/04 00:00,2024/03/04 12:45,,United States,PMC10912959,2024/03/04,epublish,Journal Article,89750-14-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide 1); 0 (Hemoglobins); 0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors); 0 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists),IM,,JAMA Netw Open. 2024 Mar 4;7(3):e240946. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0946.,MEDLINE,JAMA Netw Open,Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors vs GLP-1 RAs and Anemia in Patients With Diabetes and  CKD.,,,,7
39038293,"BACKGROUND: Limited evidence exists on the safety of pharmacokinetic interactions  of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 (CYP2D6)-metabolized opioids with antidepressants among older nursing home (NH) residents. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of concomitant use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids and antidepressants with clinical outcomes and opioid-related adverse events (ORAEs). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using a target trial emulation framework. SETTING: 100% Medicare NH sample linked to Minimum Data Set (MDS) from 2010 to 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Long-term residents aged 65 years and older receiving CYP2D6-metabolized opioids with a disease indication for antidepressant use. INTERVENTION: Initiating CYP2D6-inhibiting versus CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants that overlapped with use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids for 1 day or more. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical outcomes were worsening pain, physical function, and depression from baseline to quarterly MDS assessments and were analyzed using modified Poisson regression models. The ORAE outcomes included counts of pain-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose and were analyzed with negative binomial or Poisson regression models. All models were adjusted for baseline covariates via inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among 29 435 identified residents, use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids concomitantly with CYP2D6-inhibiting (vs. CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with a higher adjusted rate ratio of worsening pain (1.13 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.17]) and higher adjusted incidence rate ratios of pain-related hospitalization (1.37 [CI, 1.19 to 1.59]), pain-related ED visit (1.49 [CI, 1.24 to 1.80]), and OUD (1.93 [CI, 1.37 to 2.73]), with no difference in physical function, depression, and opioid overdose. LIMITATION: Findings are generalizable to NH populations only. CONCLUSION: Use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids concomitantly with CYP2D6-inhibiting (vs. CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with worsening pain and increased risk for most assessed ORAEs among older NH residents.

38847907,"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin in  patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). However, their safety and effectiveness in patients with AFib and cancer are inconclusive. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by emulating a target trial. Patients with a record of cancer (breast, prostate, or lung), newly diagnosed with AFib initiated DOACs or warfarin within 3 months after AFib diagnosis from the 2012-2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database were included. We compared the risk of ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and secondary outcomes (venous thromboembolism, intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and non-critical site bleeding) between patients who initiated DOACs and warfarin. Inverse probability treatment weights and inverse probability censoring weights were used to adjust imbalanced patient and disease characteristics and loss to follow-up between the two groups. Weighted pooled logistic regression were used to estimate treatment effect with hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (95% CIs). RESULTS: The incidence rates of stroke and major bleeding between DOAC and warfarin initiators were 9.97 vs. 9.91 and 7.74 vs. 9.24 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively. In adjusted intention-to-treat analysis, patients initiated DOACs had no statistically significant difference in risk of ischemic stroke (HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.52-1.44) and major bleeding (HR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.77-1.68) compared to those initiated warfarin. In adjusted per-protocol analysis, there was no statistical difference in risk of ischemic stroke (HR = 1.81, 95% CI 0.75-4.36) and lower risk for major bleeding, but the 95% CI was wide (HR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.12-0.99) among DOAC initiators compared to warfarin initiators. The benefits in secondary outcomes were in favor of DOACs. The findings remained consistent across subgroups and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: DOACs are safe and effective alternatives to warfarin in the management of patients with AFib and cancer.","Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Auburn University Harrison  College of Pharmacy, 4306d Walker Building, Auburn, AL, USA.; Department of Pharmacy Practice, Auburn University Harrison College of Pharmacy,  Auburn, AL, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Auburn University Harrison  College of Pharmacy, 4306d Walker Building, Auburn, AL, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Auburn University Harrison  College of Pharmacy, 4306d Walker Building, Auburn, AL, USA.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Auburn University College of Sciences  and Mathematics, Auburn, AL, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Auburn University Harrison  College of Pharmacy, 4306d Walker Building, Auburn, AL, USA. jzq0004@auburn.edu.",10.1007/s10557-024-07589-7 [pii]; 10.1007/s10557-024-07589-7 [doi],Truong B; Hornsby L; Fox B; Chou C; Zheng J; Qian J,ORCID: 0000-0002-8654-5444; ORCID: 0000-0003-4624-9963,© 2024.

40323454,"PURPOSE: Ketamine use is a potentially modifiable risk factor for hallucinations.  We aimed to use target trial emulation to investigate the association between low-dose ketamine and development of hallucinations in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Retrospective study using data from a university affiliated ICU in Melbourne, Australia. Application of marginal structural models and parametric g-formulas to assess the impact of low-dose ketamine on the development of hallucinations. RESULTS: We studied 7514 patients from June 2016 to April 2021. Of these, 625 patients (8%) received low-dose ketamine, beginning at a median of 0 (0-1) days from ICU admission and at a mean daily dose of 0.11 (0.08-0.15) mg/kg/h. Low-dose ketamine treated patients had a higher rate of hallucinations within 30 days of ICU admission (26% vs. 7%; p < 0.001) and the first episode of hallucination occurred earlier than in unexposed patient (2 [1-3] vs. 3 [1-7] days from ICU admission; p < 0.001). After adjustment for baseline and time-dependent confounders, low-dose ketamine was associated with a higher risk of hallucinations within 30 days (OR, 6.46 [95% CI 5.17-8.07]; p < 0.001). These findings were confirmed with parametric g-formulas. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU patients, low-dose ketamine was strongly associated with an increased risk of hallucinations. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the observational nature of the study and the risk of residual confounding.","Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.  ary.serpaneto@monash.edu.; Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre, School of Public  Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. ary.serpaneto@monash.edu.; Data Analytics Research and Evaluation (DARE) Centre, Austin Health and The  University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia. ary.serpaneto@monash.edu.; Department of Critical Care, School of Medicine, The University of Melbourne,  Parkville, Melbourne, Australia. ary.serpaneto@monash.edu.; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São  Paulo, Brazil. ary.serpaneto@monash.edu.; Data Analytics Research and Evaluation (DARE) Centre, Austin Health and The  University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia.; Department of Critical Care, School of Medicine, The University of Melbourne,  Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Anaesthesiology, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Data Analytics Research and Evaluation (DARE) Centre, Austin Health and The  University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and  Immunity, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.; Data Analytics Research and Evaluation (DARE) Centre, Austin Health and The  University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia.; Data Analytics Research and Evaluation (DARE) Centre, Austin Health and The  University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia.; Business Intelligence Unit, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Data Analytics Research and Evaluation (DARE) Centre, Austin Health and The  University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia.; Business Intelligence Unit, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Critical Care, School of Medicine, The University of Melbourne,  Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Intensive Care, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.; Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre, School of Public  Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.; Data Analytics Research and Evaluation (DARE) Centre, Austin Health and The  University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia.; Department of Critical Care, School of Medicine, The University of Melbourne,  Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.",10.1007/s00134-025-07926-w [pii]; 7926 [pii]; 10.1007/s00134-025-07926-w [doi],Serpa Neto A; Young M; Chan JW; Holmes NE; Kishore K; Pandey D; Jahanabadi H; Casamento A; Bellomo R,ORCID: 0000-0003-1520-9387,© 2025.

39983535,"BACKGROUND: Cefazolin is the primary antibiotic for surgical prophylaxis in  orthopedic procedures. The cessation of cefazolin supply in approximately 60 % of Japanese hospitals from 2019 to 2020 provided an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative beta-lactams for preventing surgical site infection (SSI). Given the global potential for antibiotics shortages, confirming the effectiveness of alternative beta-lactams is critical. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the differences in risk of reoperation for SSI between cefazolin and alternative beta-lactams in patients undergoing lower extremity fracture surgeries. METHODS: We emulated a target trial to compare the effectiveness of cefazolin with alternative beta-lactams-specifically broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins-in preventing SSI using a Japanese hospital administrative database provided by JMDC Inc. We included patients undergoing initial open reduction and internal fixation for closed lower extremity fractures between March 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020. The outcome was reoperation for SSI within 30 days after surgery. Risks were estimated using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for confounders via inverse probability weighting. Sensitivity analyses extended the follow-up period to 90 and 365 days. RESULTS: Of the 16,602 patients analyzed, 35 patients (0.30 %) in the cefazolin group (11,538 patients) and 16 patients (0.32 %) in the alternative beta-lactam group (5,064 patients) underwent reoperation for SSI within 30 days. The estimated 30-day risk was 0.31 % in the cefazolin group and 0.37 % in the alternative beta-lactam group, resulting in a risk difference of -0.06 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], -0.33 to 0.14) and a risk ratio of 0.82 (95 % CI, 0.50 to 1.52). In sensitivity analyses, the estimated 90-day risk was 0.67 % in the cefazolin group and 0.57 % in the alternative beta-lactam group, with a risk difference of 0.10 % (95 % CI, -0.15 to 0.32) and a risk ratio of 1.19 (95 % CI, 0.80 to 1.62). The 365-day risk was 1.02 % and 0.90 %, respectively, with a risk difference of 0.12 % (95 % CI, -0.29 to 0.39) and a risk ratio of 1.13 (95 % CI, 0.78 to 1.51). CONCLUSIONS: In surgeries for lower extremity fractures, substituting cefazolin with alternative beta-lactams did not result in substantial differences in the risk of reoperation for SSI.","Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

38957996,"Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (""Z-drugs"") are prescribed for insomnia but might  increase the risk of motor vehicle crash (MVC) among older adults through prolonged drowsiness and delayed reaction times. We estimated the effect of initiating Z-drug treatment on the 12-week risk of MVC in a sequential target trial emulation. After linking New Jersey driver licensing and police-reported MVC data to Medicare claims, we emulated a new target trial each week (July 1, 2007, to October 7, 2017) in which Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries were classified as Z-drug-treated or untreated at baseline and followed for an MVC. We used inverse probability of treatment and censoring-weighted pooled logistic regression models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences with 95% bootstrap confidence limits (CLs). There were 257 554 person-trials, of which 103 371 were Z-drug-treated and 154 183 untreated, giving rise to 976 and 1249 MVCs, respectively. The intention-to-treat RR was 1.06 (95% CL, 0.95-1.16). For the per-protocol estimand, there were 800 MVCs and 1241 MVCs among treated and untreated person-trials, respectively, suggesting a reduced MVC risk (RR, 0.83; 95% CL, 0.74-0.92) with sustained Z-drug treatment. Z-drugs should be prescribed to older patients judiciously but not withheld entirely over concerns about MVC risk.

38629975,"BACKGROUND: Initiation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9  monoclonal antibody (PCSK9 mAb) for lipid-lowering following myocardial infarction (MI) is likely affected by patients' prognostic factors, potentially leading to bias when comparing real-world treatment effects. METHODS: Using target-trial emulation, we assessed potential confounding when comparing two treatment strategies post-MI: initiation of PCSK9 mAb within 1 year and no initiation of PCSK9 mAb. We identified MI hospitalizations during July 2015-June 2020 for patients aged ≥18 years in Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart (CDM) and MarketScan, and those aged ≥66 in the US Medicare claims database. We estimated a 3-year counterfactual cumulative risk and risk difference (RD) for 10 negative control outcomes using the clone-censor-weight approach to address time-varying confounding and immortal person-time. RESULTS: PCSK9 mAb initiation within 1-year post-MI was low (0.7% in MarketScan and 0.4% in both CDM and Medicare databases). In CDM, there was a lower risk for cancer (RD = -3.6% [95% CI: -4.3%, -2.9%]), decubitus ulcer (RD = -7.7% [95% CI: -11.8%, -3.7%]), fracture (RD = -8.1% [95% CI: -9.6%, -6.6%]), influenza vaccine (RD = -9.3% [95% CI: -17.5%, -1.1%]), and visual test (RD = -0.6% [95% CI: -0.7%, -0.6%]) under the PCSK9 mAb initiation versus no initiation strategy. Similar differences persisted in the MarketScan and Medicare databases. In each database, ezetimibe and low-density lipoprotein testing were unbalanced between treatment strategies. CONCLUSION: A comparative effectiveness study of these treatments using the current approach would likely bias results due to the low number of PCSK9 mAb initiators.","Amgen Ltd., Uxbridge, United Kingdom.; Target RWE, Inc., Durham, NC.; Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel  Hill, NC.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.; Target RWE, Inc., Durham, NC.; Target RWE, Inc., Durham, NC.; Center for Observational Research, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.; Target RWE, Inc., Durham, NC.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC.; Center for Observational Research, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA.",00001648-202407000-00019 [pii]; EDE23-0218 [pii]; 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001730 [doi],Sloot R; Breskin A; Colantonio LD; Allmon AG; Yu Y; Sakhuja S; Chen L; Muntner P; Brookhart MA; Dhalwani N,ORCID: 0000-0002-3865-9607; ORCID: 0000-0003-3204-1328,"Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38586590,"BACKGROUND: Current labelling advises discontinuation of metformin when estimated  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) due to increased risk of lactic acidosis. However, in real-world practice, the risk-benefit ratios remain uncertain. We examined the risk associations of discontinued-metformin use with cardiorenal and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and advanced chronic kidney disease. METHODS: In this territory-wide, retrospective cohort and target trial emulation study, we included Chinese patients attending the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA) and enrolled in the Risk-Assessment-and-Management-Programme-for-Diabetes-Mellitus (RAMP-DM) from 2002 to 2019. Patients were stratified by discontinuation of metformin within six months after reaching eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2018, and followed up until December 31 2019. We excluded patients who had observational time <6 months from eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and had their eGFR measured during a hospitalisation episode due to acute kidney injury, or missing diagnosis date of diabetes. We compared the risk associations of metformin discontinuation with clinical outcomes. The primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), cancer, and all-cause mortality. A Cox-model with time-dependent exposure and covariates was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of outcomes in a propensity-score overlap-weighted cohort. The risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis (serum lactate > 5.0 mmol/L with a concomitant blood pH < 7.35 or ICD-9 codes of 276.2) in discontinued-metformin versus continued-metformin users was assessed in a separate register-based cohort. FINDINGS: A total of 33,586 metformin users with new-onset eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) were included in the study, 7500 (22.3%) of whom discontinued metformin within 6 months whereas 26,086 (77.7%) continued use of metformin. During a median follow-up of 3.8 (IQR: 2.2-6.1) years, 16.4% (5505/33,586), 30.1% (10,113/33,586), and 7.1% (2171/30,682) had incident MACE, ESKD, and cancer respectively, and 44.4% (14,917/33,586) died. Compared to continued-metformin use, discontinuation was associated with higher risk of MACE (weighted and adjusted HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.29-1.52), ESKD (HR = 1.52, 1.42-1.62), and death (HR = 1.22, 1.18-1.27). No association was observed for cancer (HR = 0.93, 0.85-1.01). Discontinued-metformin users had higher change in HbA1c change at 6-month of follow-up versus continued-metformin users (weighted mean HbA1c level change: 0.5% [0.4-0.6%] versus 0.2% [0.1-0.2]). In the separate register-based cohort (n = 3235), null association was observed between metformin use and risk of lactic acidosis (weighted HR = 0.94 [0.53-1.64]). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that discontinuation of metformin in patients with T2D and chronic kidney disease may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular-renal events. Use of metformin below eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) may be associated with cardiovascular, renal, and mortality benefits that need to be weighed against the risk of lactic acidosis, but further research is needed to validate these findings.

36563766,"PURPOSE: To emulate a hypothetical target trial assessing the effect of  initiating 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) versus gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GN) within 8 weeks of diagnosis on overall survival. METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted using population-level data from Alberta, Canada. Individuals diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer between April 2015 and December 2019 were identified through the provincial cancer registry and followed until March 2021. Records were linked to other administrative databases containing information on relevant variables. Individuals were excluded if they did not have adequate hemoglobin, platelet, white blood cell, and serum creatinine measures or if they received prior therapy. The observational analog of the per-protocol effect was estimated using inverse probability weighted Kaplan-Meier curves with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Four hundred seven individuals were eligible. The weighted median overall survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.7-11.9) for FOLFIRINOX and 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.3 to 5.8) for GN. The adjusted difference in median overall survival was 3.2 months (95% CI, 1.1-7.4) and the mortality hazard ratio was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.61-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates favored the initiation of FOLFIRINOX over GN with respect to overall survival.","Oncology Outcomes Research Initiative, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada;  Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Division of Real World and Advanced Analytics, Cytel, Toronto, Canada.

Veterans represent a population at risk of ischemic events from rapid lowering of BP, but the impact of as-needed BP medication use in this population is unknown.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation and propensity score matching included adult veterans, who were hospitalized 3 or more days in Veterans Administration hospitals between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2020. Participants must have been hospitalized on a non-intensive care unit medical or surgical floor, must not have undergone surgery, and must have received at least 1 scheduled BP medication in the first 24 hours of admission. Participants also must have had at least 1 systolic BP more than 140 mm Hg during hospitalization. Data in this study were analyzed from April 2023 to August 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to first AKI occurrence during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included greater than 25% reduction in systolic BP within 3 hours of as-needed BP medication administration and the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death during hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 133 760 veterans eligible for analysis (mean [SD] age, 71.2 [11.6] years), 96% were male. The mean (SD) baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 75.7 (22.7) mL/min/1.73m2. A total of 28 526 patients (21%) received as-needed BP medication. As-needed BP medication use was associated with an increased AKI risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.18-1.29]) compared to nonusers. Subgroup analyses showed higher AKI risk with intravenous as-needed BP medication use (compared to oral or combined oral and intravenous routes). Secondary analyses indicated as-needed BP medication users had a 1.5-fold greater risk of rapid BP reduction (95% CI, 1.39-1.62) and 1.69-fold higher rate of the composite outcome (95% CI, 1.49-1.92) compared to nonusers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this retrospective cohort study showed that as-needed BP medication use among veterans is associated with increased AKI risk. The risks and benefits of this type of BP medication use would best be determined through a prospective trial, and these data suggest that there is the necessary equipoise to conduct such a trial.","Medical Service, Research Service and Geriatric Research Education and Clinical  Center, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida.; Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville.; Research Service, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System,  Gainesville.; College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville.; Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Minneapolis, Minnesota.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, North Florida/South Georgia  Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida.; Research Service, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System,  Gainesville.; College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, Orlando.; Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System and the University of Minnesota.; Department of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New  Orleans.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, North Florida/South Georgia  Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida, Gainesville.; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, School of  Medicine, and Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing, Health Policy Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.; North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System Geriatric Research Education  and Clinical Center, Gainesville, Florida.",2826330 [pii]; ioi240078 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.6213 [doi],Canales MT; Yang S; Westanmo A; Wang X; Hadley D; Ishani A; Mohandas R; Shorr R; Lo-Ciganic W,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Hadley reported grants from the VA  Intergovernmental Personnel Act contract during the conduct of the study.

35610649,"BACKGROUND: Immunomodulatory therapies that improve the outcome of sepsis are not  available. We sought to determine whether treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis with low-dose erythromycin-a macrolide antibiotic with broad immunomodulatory effects-decreased mortality and ameliorated underlying disease pathophysiology. METHODS: We conducted a target trial emulation, comparing patients with sepsis admitted to two intensive care units (ICU) in the Netherlands for at least 72 h, who were either exposed or not exposed during this period to treatment with low-dose erythromycin (up to 600 mg per day, administered as a prokinetic agent) but no other macrolides. We used two common propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) to deal with confounding by indication and subsequently used Cox regression models to estimate the treatment effect on the primary outcome of mortality rate up to day 90. Secondary clinical outcomes included change in SOFA, duration of mechanical ventilation and the incidence of ICU-acquired infections. We used linear mixed models to assess differences in 15 host response biomarkers reflective of key pathophysiological processes from admission to day 4. RESULTS: In total, 235 patients started low-dose erythromycin treatment, 470 patients served as controls. Treatment started at a median of 38 [IQR 25-52] hours after ICU admission for a median of 5 [IQR 3-8] total doses in the first course. Matching and weighting resulted in populations well balanced for proposed confounders. We found no differences between patients treated with low-dose erythromycin and control subjects in mortality rate up to day 90: matching HR 0.89 (95% CI 0.64-1.24), weighting HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.66-1.36). There were no differences in secondary clinical outcomes. The change in host response biomarker levels from admission to day 4 was similar between erythromycin-treated and control subjects. CONCLUSION: In this target trial emulation in critically ill patients with sepsis, we could not demonstrate an effect of treatment with low-dose erythromycin on mortality, secondary clinical outcomes or host response biomarkers.","Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical  Centers, Location Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. t.d.reijnders@amsterdamumc.nl.; Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical  Centers, Location Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical  Centers, Location Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical  Centers, Location Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; AP-HP, Hôpital Louis Mourier, DMU ESPRIT, Médecine Intensive-Réanimation, 92700,  Colombes, France.; Université de Paris, UFR de Médecine, 75018, Paris, France.; INSERM U1151, CNRS UMR 8253, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, 75015, Paris,  France.; Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht,  The Netherlands.; Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center  Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht,  Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Intensive Care Medicine, and Laboratory of Experimental Intensive  Care and Anesthesiology (LEICA), Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU), Mahidol University,  Bangkok, Thailand.; Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Epidemiology and Data Science, Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam  University Medical Centers, Location Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical  Centers, Location Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location  Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",10.1186/s13054-022-04016-x [pii]; 4016 [pii]; 10.1186/s13054-022-04016-x [doi],Reijnders TDY; Peters-Sengers H; van Vught LA; Uhel F; Bonten MJM; Cremer OL; Schultz MJ; Stuiver MM; van der Poll T,,© 2022.

38420907,"Rehabilitation providers and policymakers need valid evidence to make informed  decisions about the healthcare needs of the population. Whenever possible, these decisions should be informed by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, there are circumstances when evidence needs to be generated rapidly, or when RCTs are not ethical or feasible. These situations apply to studying the effects of complex interventions, including rehabilitation as defined by Cochrane Rehabilitation. Therefore, we explore using the target trial emulation framework by Hernán and colleagues to obtain valid estimates of the causal effects of rehabilitation when RCTs cannot be conducted. Target trial emulation is a framework guiding the design and analysis of non-randomized comparative effectiveness studies using observational data, by emulating a hypothetical RCT. In the context of rehabilitation, we outline steps for applying the target trial emulation framework using real world data, highlighting methodological considerations, limitations, potential mitigating strategies, and causal inference and counterfactual theory as foundational principles to estimating causal effects. Overall, we aim to strengthen methodological approaches used to estimate causal effects of rehabilitation when RCTs cannot be conducted.","Institute for Disability and Rehabilitation Research, Faculty of Health Sciences,  Ontario Tech University, Oshawa, ON, Canada.; Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dentals Sciences, University &quot;La  Statale&quot;, Milan, Italy.; IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Milan, Italy.; Department of Orthopedics, University Medical Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands.; Harvard T.H.

39642890,"BACKGROUND: Regulators and oncology healthcare providers are increasingly  interested in using observational studies of real-world data (RWD) to complement clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials for informed decision-making. To generate valid evidence, RWD studies must be carefully designed to avoid systematic biases. The clone-censor-weight (CCW) method has been proposed to address immortal time and other time-related biases. METHODS: The objective of this manuscript is to de-mystify the CCW method for cancer researchers by describing and presenting its core components in an accessible and digestible format, using visualizations and examples from cancer-relevant studies. The CCW method has been applied in diverse settings, including investigations of the effects of surgery within a certain time after cancer diagnosis, the continuation of annual screening mammography, and chemotherapy duration on survival. RESULTS: The method handles complex data wherein the treatment group to which an individual belongs is unknown at the start of follow-up. The three steps of the CCW method involve cloning or duplicating the patient population and assigning one clone to each treatment strategy, artificially censoring the clones when their observed data are inconsistent with the assigned strategy and weighting the cloned and censored population to address selection bias created by the artificial censoring. CONCLUSIONS: The CCW method is a powerful tool for designing RWD studies in cancer that are free from time-related biases and successfully, to the extent possible, emulate features of a randomized clinical trial.","Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes, and Policy, University of  Illinois-Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance, Daiichi Sankyo Inc.,, Basking Ridge, New  Jersey, USA.; Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Minority Health and Health  Disparities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São  Paulo, Brazil.; Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance, Daiichi Sankyo Inc.,, Basking Ridge, New  Jersey, USA.; Center for Real-World Effectiveness and Safety of Therapeutics (CREST),  University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Inequalities in Cancer Outcomes Network, London School of Hygiene and Tropical  Medicine, London, UK.; RTI Health Solutions, Barcelona, Spain.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.",CAM470461 [pii]; 10.1002/cam4.70461 [doi],Gaber CE; Ghazarian AA; Strassle PD; Ribeiro TB; Salas M; Maringe C; Garcia-Albeniz X; Wyss R; Du W; Lund JL,ORCID: 0000-0002-6752-2968; ORCID: 0000-0002-1072-1560; ORCID: 0000-0002-1108-0689,© 2024 The Author(s).

37903369,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been linked to the development of many post-COVID-19  conditions (PCCs) after acute infection. Limited information is available on the effectiveness of oral antivirals used to treat acute COVID-19 in preventing the development of PCCs. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effectiveness of outpatient treatment of COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in preventing PCCs. DESIGN: Retrospective target trial emulation study comparing matched cohorts receiving nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no treatment. SETTING: Veterans Health Administration (VHA). PARTICIPANTS: Nonhospitalized veterans in VHA care who were at risk for severe COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during January through July 2022. INTERVENTION: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Cumulative incidence of 31 potential PCCs at 31 to 180 days after treatment or a matched index date, including cardiac, pulmonary, renal, thromboembolic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, mental health, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and general conditions and symptoms. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of the participants were male, with a median age of 66 years, and 17.5% were unvaccinated. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between participants treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and matched untreated comparators. No differences were observed between participants treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 9593) and their matched untreated comparators in the incidence of most PCCs examined individually or grouped by organ system, except for lower combined risk for venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism (subhazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.97]; cumulative incidence difference, -0.29 percentage points [CI, -0.52 to -0.05 percentage points]). LIMITATIONS: Ascertainment of PCCs using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes may be inaccurate. Evaluation of many outcomes could have resulted in spurious associations with combined thromboembolic events by chance. CONCLUSION: Out of 31 potential PCCs, only combined thromboembolic events seemed to be reduced by nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

34118301,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Evidence is mixed regarding the optimal choice of the  first permanent vascular access for elderly patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). Lacking data from randomized controlled trials, we used a target trial emulation approach to compare arteriovenous fistula (AVF) versus arteriovenous graft (AVG) creation among elderly patients receiving HD. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Elderly patients included in the US Renal Data System who initiated HD with a catheter and had an AVF or AVG created within 6 months of starting HD. EXPOSURE: Creation of an AVF versus an AVG as the incident arteriovenous access. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality, all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization, and sepsis. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Target trial emulation approach, high-dimensional propensity score and inverse probability of treatment weighting, and instrumental variable analysis using the proclivity of the operating physician to create a fistula as the instrumental variable. RESULTS: A total of 19,867 patients were included, with 80.1% receiving an AVF and 19.9% an AVG. In unweighted analysis, AVF creation was associated with significantly lower risks of mortality and hospitalization, especially within 6 months after vascular access creation. In inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis, AVF creation was associated with lower incidences of mortality and hospitalization within 6 months after creation (hazard ratios of 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75-0.91] and 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78-0.87] for mortality and all-cause hospitalization, respectively), but not between 6 months and 3 years after access creation. No association between AVF creation and mortality, sepsis, or all-cause, cardiovascular disease-related, or infection-related hospitalization was found in instrumental variable analyses. However, AVF creation was associated with a lower risk of access-related hospitalization not due to infection. LIMITATIONS: Potential for unmeasured confounding, analyses limited to elderly patients, and absence of data on actual access use during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Using observational data to emulate a target randomized controlled trial, the type of initial arteriovenous access created was not associated with the risks of mortality, sepsis, or all-cause, cardiovascular disease-related, or infection-related hospitalization among elderly patients who initiated HD with a catheter.","Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin School of  Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin.; Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public  Health Madison, Wisconsin.; Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public  Health Madison, Wisconsin.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin School of  Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin; Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health Madison, Wisconsin.

36869641,"AIM: To compare the efficacy of chitosan and intrauterine device (IUD)  combination with an IUD alone in patients with intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) who underwent hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 303 patients with moderate-to-severe IUA (American Fertility Society [AFS] score ≥5) who underwent hysteroscopic adhesiolysis between January 2018 and December 2020. Using observational data under a cohort design, we emulated a target trial with two treatment arms: chitosan plus IUD and IUD alone groups. Second-look hysteroscopy was performed in all patients 3 months after the initial hysteroscopy. The primary outcome was improved adhesion assessed using the AFS scoring system. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. The second hysteroscopy revealed significantly better AFS scores in group A than in group B (values: 3 [1-4] vs. 4 [2-6], p < 0.001; change: 63% [50%-80%] vs. 44% [33%-67%], p < 0.001, respectively). Significantly better menstruation conditions (improved rate: 66% vs. 49%, p = 0.004) and endometrial thickness (mean: 7.0 mm vs. 6.0 mm, p < 0.001) were also observed in group A than in group B. Moreover, group A showed a significantly higher 1-year clinical pregnancy rate (40% vs. 28%, p = 0.037) and better quality of life (p < 0.001) than group B. CONCLUSIONS: Chitosan and IUD combination showed better efficacy in reducing adhesions and improving clinical outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe IUA after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis.","Department of Gynecology, The Fourth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang,  China.; Department of Obstetrics, The Fourth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang,  China.; Department of Gynecology, The Fourth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang,  China.; Department of Gynecology, The Fourth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang,  China.; Department of Gynecology, The Fourth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang,  China.; Department of Gynecology, The Fourth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang,  China.; Department of Gynecology, The Fourth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang,  China.",10.1111/jog.15629 [doi],Zhang H; Shao L; Wang L; Gao Y; Cui W; Chu D; Zhang Y,ORCID: 0000-0003-4679-6262,© 2023 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.,,,,,2023/03/04 03:52,20230615,20230304,2023 Jun,2023/03/05 06:00,,,"Zhang, Hongjuan; Shao, Lijin; Wang, Lina; Gao, Yu; Cui, Wei; Chu, Dongmei; Zhang, Ying",,211460583/Shijiazhuang Science and Technology Research and Development Program/,6,,1447-0756,1341-8076,,9612761,The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,eng,10.1111/jog.15629 [doi],20230615,Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Chitosan/therapeutic use; Hysteroscopy/adverse effects; *Intrauterine Devices/adverse effects; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Tissue Adhesions/prevention & control/surgery/etiology; *Uterine Diseases/surgery/etiology,2023/06/05 06:42,,,,chitosan hydrogel; hysteroscopy; intrauterine adhesions; intrauterine device; pregnancy outcomes,NOTNLM,NLM,1571-1578,2023/02/20 00:00,2023/03/04 03:52,2023/06/05 06:42,,,2023/03/05 06:00,2022/10/06 00:00,Australia,,,ppublish,Clinical Trial; Journal Article,9012-76-4 (Chitosan),IM,,J Obstet Gynaecol Res. 2023 Jun;49(6):1571-1578. doi: 10.1111/jog.15629.

40197402,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies investigating the effectiveness of augmentation  therapy have been limited. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of antipsychotic augmentation therapies among patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHOD: We included patients diagnosed with depression receiving two antidepressant courses within 1 year between 2009 and 2020 and used the clone-censor-weight approach to address time-lag bias. Participants were assigned to either an antipsychotic or a third-line antidepressant. Primary outcomes were suicide attempt and suicide death. Cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality were considered as safety outcomes. Weighted pooled logistic regression and non-parametric bootstrapping were used to estimate approximate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The cohort included 39 949 patients receiving antipsychotics and the same number of matched antidepressant patients. The mean age was 51.2 (standard deviation 16.0) years, and 37.3% of participants were male. Compared with patients who received third-line antidepressants, those receiving antipsychotics had reduced risk of suicide attempt (sub-distribution hazard ratio 0.77; 95% CI 0.72-0.83) but not suicide death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08; 95% CI 0.93-1.27). After applying the clone-censor-weight approach, there was no association between antipsychotic augmentation and reduced risk of suicide attempt (hazard ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.89-1.29) or suicide death (hazard ratio 1.22; 95% CI 0.91-1.71). However, antipsychotic users had increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.21; 95% CI 1.07-1.33). CONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic augmentation was not associated with reduced risk of suicide-related outcomes when time-lag bias was addressed; however, it was associated with increased all-cause mortality. These findings do not support the use of antipsychotic augmentation in patients with treatment-resistant depression.","School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.",S0007125024002836 [pii]; 10.1192/bjp.2024.283 [doi],Tsai DH; Yang AS; Wong ZX; Chuang AT; Cheng MC; Shen CY; Shao SC; Lai EC,ORCID: 0000-0003-2841-0338; ORCID: 0000-0002-1674-0148; ORCID: 0009-0000-1738-9671; ORCID: 0000-0002-8640-3593; ORCID: 0000-0002-8885-6406; ORCID: 0000-0003-4867-6686; ORCID: 0000-0002-5852-7652,,,,,,2025/04/08 10:50,,20250408,2025 Apr 8,2025/04/08 13:55,,,"Tsai, Daniel Hsiang-Te; Yang, Avery Shuei-He; Wong, Zi-Xuan; Chuang, Albert Tzu-Ming; Cheng, Michael Chun-Yuan; Shen, Chin-Yao; Shao, Shih-Chieh; Lai, Edward Chia-Cheng",,,,,1472-1465,0007-1250,,0342367,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,eng,10.1192/bjp.2024.283 [doi],20250408,,2025/04/08 13:55,,,,Antidepressants; antipsychotic augmentation; suicide attempt; time-lag bias; treatment-resistant depression,NOTNLM,NLM,1-9,,2025/04/08 10:50,2025/04/08 13:55,,,2025/04/08 13:55,,England,,,aheadofprint,Journal Article,,IM,,Br J Psychiatry. 2025 Apr 8:1-9. doi: 10.1192/bjp.2024.283.,Publisher,Br J Psychiatry,Antipsychotic therapy and suicide risk in patients with treatment-resistant  depression: target trial emulation framework study.,,,,
40208301,"BACKGROUND: Statins are associated with liver-related adverse events, with risk  varying by statin type. However, current guidelines lack specific recommendations for statin selection in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with elevated liver enzymes. METHODS: This cohort study used a target trial emulation approach to include AMI patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention between 2013 and 2022 from the Tianjin Health and Medical Data Platform, China. Eligible patients with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin prescriptions during hospitalization were matched 1:1 using propensity scores in those with elevated liver enzymes and normal liver enzymes respectively, and tracked for 1 year or until death (intention-to-treat analysis). Nonadherent patients were censored in the per-protocol analysis. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes including recurrent MI and stroke. RESULTS: In a matched cohort of 25,728 patients with elevated liver enzymes, 614 deaths (2.4%) occurred. Atorvastatin was associated with higher all-cause mortality compared to rosuvastatin (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.51), consistent in the per-protocol analysis, and the in-hospital mortality difference was confirmed in an independent cohort. No significant differences were observed for recurrent MI (HR: 0.98, 95% CI 0.87-1.11) or stroke (HR: 1.10, 95% CI 0.93-1.28). Similar target trial emulation design among 18,270 AMI patients with normal liver enzymes at admission (9135 per group) found no significant differences between the two statins in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.09, 95% CI 0.88-1.35), recurrent MI (HR: 1.05, 95% CI 0.90-1.23), or stroke (HR: 1.07, 95% CI 0.90-1.28). CONCLUSIONS: Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a higher risk of 1-year all-cause mortality than Rosuvastatin in a target trial emulation study of patients with elevated liver enzymes following AMI.","Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin  Medical University, 154, Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin  Medical University, 154, Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin  Medical University, 154, Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin  Medical University, 154, Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin  Medical University, 154, Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China.; Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, National University of  Singapore, 18 Science Drive 4, Singapore, 117543, Singapore.; Department of Cardiology, National University Heart Centre, 5 Lower Kent Ridge  Rd, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.; Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University Health System, 14 Medical  Drive, Singapore, 117599, Singapore.; Yong Loo-Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 1E, Kent,  Ridge Road, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.; Department of Cardiology, National University Heart Centre, 5 Lower Kent Ridge  Rd, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.; Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University Health System, 14 Medical  Drive, Singapore, 117599, Singapore.; Yong Loo-Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 1E, Kent,  Ridge Road, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.; Division of Cardiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of  California, Geffen Hall 885 Tiverton Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin  Medical University, 154, Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China. cardio-yq@tmu.edu.cn.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin  Medical University, 154, Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, China. xinzhou@tmu.edu.cn.",10.1007/s00392-025-02645-0 [pii]; 10.1007/s00392-025-02645-0 [doi],Chen X; Liu H; Li L; A G; Sun P; Tan DS; Chan MY; Foo RS; Fonarow GC; Yang Q; Zhou X,ORCID: 0000-0003-1395-7103,"© 2025.

40135571,"BACKGROUND: Both diabetes and low magnesium-containing food intake may increase  the risk of heart failure (HF). However, the effect of nonprescription magnesium supplements on the risk of HF or major adverse cardiac events in patients with diabetes is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a target-trial-emulation approach, we assembled a national cohort of 94 239 veterans ≥40 years with diabetes, without prior HF or magnesium use, who received ambulatory care in the US veterans-health care system documented by electronic clinic notes between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2020. A natural language processing approach was used to detect self-reported magnesium-supplement use from clinic notes, n=17 619 were identified as users versus n=76 620 as nonusers. Using inverse probability treatment weighting, we constructed a cohort balanced in 88 baseline characteristics between users and nonusers. The primary outcome was incident HF. Secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke, HF hospitalization, or death). Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with magnesium-supplement use and outcomes were estimated in the inverse probability treatment weighting weighted cohort using Cox regression. The inverse probability treatment weighting weighted cohort had a mean age of 67.4±10.3 years; 18.4% were Black, and 5.1% were women. The mean duration of magnesium-supplement use was 3.5±3.1 (interquartile range, 1.1-5.1) years. Incident HF occurred in 8.0% of users and 9.7% of nonusers of magnesium supplements (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.89-0.99]).

39139277,"BACKGROUND: Special educational needs (SEN) provision is designed to help pupils  with additional educational, behavioural or health needs; for example, pupils with cleft lip and/or palate may be offered SEN provision to improve their speech and language skills. Our aim is to contribute to the literature and assess the impact of SEN provision on health and educational outcomes for a well-defined population. METHODS: We will use the ECHILD database, which links educational and health records across England. Our target population consists of children identified within ECHILD to have a specific congenital anomaly: isolated cleft lip and/or palate. We will apply a trial emulation framework to reduce biases in design and analysis of observational data to investigate the causal impact of SEN provision (including none) by the start of compulsory education (Year One - age five year on entry) on the number of unplanned hospital utilisation and school absences by the end of primary education (Year Six - age ten/eleven). We will use propensity score-based estimators (inverse probability weighting (IPW) and IPW regression adjustment IPW) to compare categories of SEN provision in terms of these outcomes and to triangulate results obtained using complementary estimation methods (Naïve estimator, multivariable regression, parametric g-formula, and if possible, instrumental variables), targeting a variety of causal contrasts (average treatment effect/in the treated/in the not treated) of SEN provision. CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate the impact of reasonable adjustments at the start of compulsory education on health and educational outcomes in the isolated cleft lip and palate population by triangulating complementary methods under a target-trial framework.","Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, England, WC1N 1EH,  UK.; Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, England, WC1N 1EH,  UK.; Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, England, WC1N 1EH,  UK.; Social Research Institute, University College London, London, England, WC1H 0AL,  UK.; Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, England, WC1N 1EH,  UK.",10.3310/nihropenres.13472.1 [doi],Nguyen VG; Lewis KM; Gilbert R; Dearden L; De Stavola B,ORCID: 0000-0002-9776-6242; ORCID: 0000-0003-1148-1017; ORCID: 0000-0001-7853-0528,Copyright: © 2023 Nguyen VG et al.,,,No competing interests were disclosed.,,2024/08/14 04:15,,20231024,2023,2024/08/14 06:42,,,"Nguyen, Vincent G; Lewis, Kate M; Gilbert, Ruth; Dearden, Lorraine; De Stavola, Bianca",,,,,2633-4402,2633-4402,,9918333281906676,NIHR open research,eng,10.3310/nihropenres.13472.1 [doi]; 54,20240815,,2024/08/14 06:43,,"Children born with cleft lip and/or palate have been shown to have lower academic  performance compared to the general population and have also been shown to have higher attendances to hospitals.

37753272,"BACKGROUND: Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir have emerged as promising  options for COVID-19 treatment, but direct comparisons of their effectiveness have been limited. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these two oral antiviral drugs in non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this target trial emulation study, we used data from a territory-wide electronic health records database on eligible patients aged ≥18 years infected with COVID-19 who were prescribed either molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within five days of infection between 16 March 2022 and 31 December 2022 in the non-hospitalised and hospitalised settings in Hong Kong. A sequence trial approach and 1:1 propensity score matching was applied based on age, sex, number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, Charlson comorbidity index, comorbidities, and drug use within past 90 days. Cox regression adjusted with patients' characteristics was used to compare the risk of effectiveness outcomes (all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or ventilatory support and hospitalisation) between groups. Subgroup analyses included age (<70; ≥70 years); sex, Charlson comorbidity index (<4; ≥4), and number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received (0-1; ≥2 doses). FINDINGS: A total of 63,522 non-hospitalised (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 31,761; molnupiravir: 31,761) and 11,784 hospitalised (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 5892; molnupiravir: 5892) patients were included. In non-hospitalised setting, 336 events of all-cause mortality (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 71, 0.22%; molnupiravir: 265, 0.83%), 162 events of ICU admission or ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 71, 0.22%; molnupiravir: 91, 0.29%), and 4890 events of hospitalisation (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 1853, 5.83%; molnupiravir: 3037, 9.56%) were observed. Lower risks of all-cause mortality (absolute risk reduction (ARR) at 28 days: 0.61%, 95% CI: 0.50-0.72; HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.33-0.56) and hospital admission (ARR at 28 days: 3.73%, 95% CI: 3.31-4.14; HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.67-0.76) were observed in nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users compared to molnupiravir users. In hospitalised setting, 509 events of all-cause mortality (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 176, 2.99%; molnupiravir: 333, 5.65%), and 50 events of ICU admission or ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 26, 0.44%; molnupiravir: 24, 0.41%) were observed. Risk of all-cause mortality was lower for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users than for molnupiravir users (ARR at 28 days: 2.66%, 95% CI: 1.93-3.40; HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.49-0.71). In both settings, there was no difference in the risk of intensive care unit admission or ventilatory support between groups. The findings were consistent across all subgroup's analyses. INTERPRETATION: Our analyses suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was more effective than molnupiravir in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality in both non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients. When neither drug is contraindicated, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be considered the more effective option.

39394165,"BACKGROUND: The suicide risk in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving novel  oral anticoagulants or warfarin has not been evaluated in real-world practice. Moreover, reducing vitamin K levels may increase the suicide risk, underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate oral anticoagulants to prevent unintended outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between different types of oral anticoagulants and the risk of attempted and completed suicide among patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: This nationwide study retrieved data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from 2012 to 2020. This study included patients with atrial fibrillation aged 20 years and older who newly received oral anticoagulant treatment, and who had no contraindications for NOACs and no history of suicide-related events. The main outcomes were suicide-related outcomes, including attempted suicide and completed suicide. This study employed the target trial emulation framework to improve the causal inference for the observed association.  RESULTS: A total of 103,768 (71.74%) patients taking NOACs and 40,877 (28.26%) patients taking warfarin were included in this study. Compared to those receiving warfarin, patients receiving NOACs were associated with a lower risk of suicide-related outcomes (HR, 0.82; 95% CIs, 0.69-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this cohort study suggested that patients receiving NOACs were associated with a lower risk of suicidal attempts but similar risk of complete suicide, compared to those receiving warfarin. Considering the risk of suicide, NOACs could be the preferred anticoagulants for patients with atrial fibrillation.","School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Family Medicine, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical  Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.; School of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. edward_lai@mail.ncku.edu.tw.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.  edward_lai@mail.ncku.edu.tw.",10.1186/s12916-024-03645-z [pii]; 3645 [pii]; 10.1186/s12916-024-03645-z [doi],Li BM; Yang AS; Cheng MC; Huang HK; Lai EC,,© 2024.

37403325,"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for eligible  patients with kidney failure who need renal replacement therapy. However, it remains unclear whether the anticipated survival benefit from kidney transplantation is different for women and men. METHODS: We included all dialysis patients recorded in the Austrian Dialysis and Transplant Registry who were waitlisted for their first kidney transplant between 2000 and 2018. In order to estimate the causal effect of kidney transplantation on 10-year restricted mean survival time, we mimicked a series of controlled clinical trials and applied inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted sequential Cox models. RESULTS: This study included 4408 patients (33% female) with a mean age of 52 years. Glomerulonephritis was the most common primary renal disease both in women (27%) and men (28%). Kidney transplantation led to a gain of 2.22 years (95% CI 1.88 to 2.49) compared with dialysis over a 10-year follow-up. The effect was smaller in women (1.95 years, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.41) than in men (2.35 years, 95% CI 1.92 to 2.70) due to a better survival on dialysis. Across ages the survival benefit of transplantation over a follow-up of 10 years was smaller in younger women and men and increased with age, showing a peak for both women and men aged about 60 years.

39139276,"INTRODUCTION: One third of children in English primary schools have additional  learning support called special educational needs (SEN) provision, but children born preterm are more likely to have SEN than those born at term. We aim to assess the impact of SEN provision on health and education outcomes in children grouped by gestational age at birth. METHODS: We will analyse linked administrative data for England using the Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data (ECHILD) database. A target trial emulation approach will be used to specify data extraction from ECHILD, comparisons of interest and our analysis plan. Our target population is all children enrolled in year one of state-funded primary school in England who were born in an NHS hospital in England between 2003 and 2008, grouped by gestational age at birth (extremely preterm (24-<28 weeks), very preterm (28-<32 weeks), moderately preterm (32-<34 weeks), late preterm (34-<37 weeks) and full term (37-<42 weeks). The intervention of interest will comprise categories of SEN provision (including none) during year one (age five/six). The outcomes of interest are rates of unplanned hospital utilisation, educational attainment, and absences by the end of primary school education (year six, age 11). We will triangulate results from complementary estimation methods including the naïve estimator, multivariable regression, g-formula, inverse probability weighting, inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment and instrumental variables, along with a variety for a variety of causal contrasts (average treatment effect, overall, and on the treated/not treated). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We have existing research ethics approval for analyses of the ECHILD database described in this protocol. We will disseminate our findings to diverse audiences (academics, relevant government departments, service users and providers) through seminars, peer-reviewed publications, short briefing reports and infographics for non-academics (published on the study website).","Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, England, WC1N 1EH,  UK.; Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, England, WC1N 1EH,  UK.; Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, England, WC1N 1EH,  UK.; Social Research Institute, University College London, London, England, WC1H 0AL,  UK.; Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, England, WC1N 1EH,  UK.",10.3310/nihropenres.13471.1 [doi],Nguyen VG; Lewis KM; Gilbert R; Dearden L; De Stavola B,ORCID: 0000-0002-9776-6242; ORCID: 0000-0003-1148-1017; ORCID: 0000-0001-7853-0528,Copyright: © 2023 Nguyen VG et al.,,,No competing interests were disclosed.,,2024/08/14 04:15,,20231121,2023,2024/08/14 06:42,,,"Nguyen, Vincent G; Lewis, Kate Marie; Gilbert, Ruth; Dearden, Lorraine; De Stavola, Bianca",,,,,2633-4402,2633-4402,,9918333281906676,NIHR open research,eng,10.3310/nihropenres.13471.1 [doi]; 59,20240815,,2024/08/14 06:43,,"One third of all children need extra help with learning in school, such as  support from a teaching assistant.

39108175,"Studying the effect of duration of treatment on prognostic outcomes using  real-world data is challenging because only people who survive for a long time can receive a treatment for a long time. Specifying a target trial helps overcome such challenge. We aimed to estimate the effect of different durations of treatment with antihypertensive drugs with anticholinergic properties (AC AHT) on the risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease by emulating a target trial using the UK CPRD GOLD database (2001-2017). Comparing treatment for 3-6 years vs ≤3 years yielded null results for both types of dementia. Comparing a longer duration of treatment, >6 years vs ≤3 years, yielded a 10-year risk ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54-0.90) for vascular dementia and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.77-1.10) for Alzheimer's disease. For illustration, we performed an analysis that failed to emulate a target trial by assigning exposure categories using postbaseline information, obtaining implausible beneficial estimates. Our findings indicate a modest benefit of longer duration of treatment with AC AHT on vascular dementia and highlight the value of the target trial emulation to avoid selection bias in the evaluation of the effect of different durations of treatment.

40294370,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: More than half of the endovascularly treated ischemic  stroke patients with incomplete reperfusion (expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] <3) show delayed reperfusion (DR) on 24-hour perfusion imaging, which is associated with favorable clinical outcome. The effect of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) on the rates of DR remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the treatment effect of IVT on the occurrence of DR. METHODS: Pooled data from 3 randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA and EXTEND-IA TNK parts 1 and 2) and 2 comprehensive stroke centers (University Hospitals Graz and Bern) were analyzed. Only patients with a final reperfusion score of eTICI 2a-2c and available perfusion imaging at follow-up of 24 ± 12 hours were included. The primary outcome was the presence of DR on 24-hour follow-up CT/MRI perfusion imaging, defined as the absence of any focal perfusion deficit on perfusion imaging, despite incomplete reperfusion on the final angiography series during thrombectomy. For the secondary analysis, we explored the association between the primary outcome (DR) and the time elapsed between start of IVT and the end of an intervention. To address confounding in observational data, we performed a target trial emulation. RESULTS: Of 832 included patients with eTICI 2a-2c (median age 74 years, 49% female), 511 (61%) had DR. There was an independent treatment effect of IVT on DR (standardized risk ratio [sRR] 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3; standardized risk difference [sRD] 8.2%, 95% CI 0.2%-16.1%), after adjusting for age, sex, atrial fibrillation, number of device passes, collateral score, and eTICI. Among those patients who have received IVT (n = 524/832, 63%), when adjusting for the aforementioned covariates, there was a causal effect of shorter time between administration of thrombolytics and end of the intervention on DR (sRR 0.93%, 95% CI 0.87-0.98; sRD -5.2%; 95% CI -9.1% to -1.3%, per hour increase). DISCUSSION: Exposure to thrombolytics showed independent treatment effect on the occurrence of DR among patients with incomplete reperfusion after thrombectomy who undergo perfusion imaging at the 24-hour follow-up. The effect of thrombolytics on DR was observed if there was a high chance of therapeutic concentrations of thrombolytics at the time point when the proximal vessel was recanalized, but distal occlusions persisted and/or occurred. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study is rated Class III because it is a nonrandomized study and there are substantial differences in baseline characteristics of the treatment groups.","Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, University Hospital  Bern Inselspital, University of Bern, Switzerland.;

39955105,"BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most  commonly diagnosed mental disorders in children. For many patients, treatment involves long-term medication in order to reduce symptoms, regulate behaviour, and, hopefully, improve school performance and achievement. However, there is little to no evidence to support a long-term effect on the latter complex outcomes. METHODS: We utilize a target trial framework to emulate a pretest-posttest control group design and estimate the intention-to-treat effect of ADHD medication on national test scores in children diagnosed with ADHD born between 2000 and 2007 in Norway. The data were obtained through linkage of Norwegian registries (NorPD, Norwegian Prescription Database; NPR, Norwegian Patient Registry; KUHR, Database for Control and Payment of Health Reimbursement; SSB, Statistics Norway; MBRN, Medical Birth Registry of Norway). RESULTS: The resulting analytic sample size consisted of 8548 children diagnosed with ADHD, with about 9% missingness in their grade eight national test scores. We find that initiating ADHD medication had a slight positive average effect on national test scores for all three domains: English, numeracy, and reading [standardized mean differences: 0.037 (95% compatibility interval (CI95), -0.003; 0.076), 0.063 (CI95, 0.016; 0.111), 0.071 (CI95, 0.030; 0.111), respectively]. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the estimated long-term average effect of ADHD medication on learning, as measured by the Norwegian national tests, is not clinically relevant. Study strengths include the use of real-world data on ecologically valid and relevant outcomes and the robustness of results across model specifications. Limitations include possibility of unobserved confounding and lack of prescription data.","Department of Child Health and Development, Norwegian Institute of Public Health,  Oslo, Norway.; Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Child Health and Development, Norwegian Institute of Public Health,  Oslo, Norway.; Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",8016235 [pii]; dyaf010 [pii]; 10.1093/ije/dyaf010 [doi],Varnet Pérez T; Øvergaard KR; Frigessi A; Biele G,ORCID: 0000-0002-2552-077X; ORCID: 0000-0002-4225-9024,© The Author(s) 2025.

First-time diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD) including vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia and other dementias were examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses during a 3-year follow-up. Models were adjusted by propensity-score matching.ResultsWe show that semaglutide was associated with a significantly reduced risk of overall ADRD incidence with a hazard ratio ranging from 0.54 (0.49-0.59) compared with insulin, 0.67 (0.61-0.74) compared with metformin, to 0.80 (0.72-0.89) compared with older generation glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1RAs). The association varied for specific dementia types, with significantly reduced risk of vascular dementia and no evidence of associations with frontotemporal and Lewy body dementias.ConclusionsThese findings provide evidence supporting protective effects of semaglutide on dementias in patients with T2D. Future works are needed to establish the causal relationships through randomized clinical trials and to characterize the underlying mechanisms.","Center for Science, Health, and Society, Case Western Reserve University School  of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Center for Community Health Integration, Case Western Reserve University School  of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University School  of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Neuroscience, Development and Regenerative Biology, College of  Sciences, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of  Health, North Bethesda, MD, USA.; Center for Clinical Informatics Research and Education, The MetroHealth System,  Cleveland, OH, USA.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.",10.1177/13872877251351329 [doi],Wang W; Davis PB; Qi X; Gurney M; Perry G; Volkow ND; Kaelber DC; Xu R,ORCID: 0000-0002-6547-0172; ORCID: 0000-0003-3127-4795,,,,"Declaration of conflicting interests The authors declared the following potential  conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: George Perry is an Editor-in-Chief of this journal but was not involved in the peer-review process of this article nor had access to any information regarding its peer-review.

36943798,"BACKGROUND: We sought to examine the cardiovascular safety of intensive  treat-to-target serum urate strategies for gout using Medicare claims data linked to electronic health record laboratory data. METHODS: We selected patients with gout who initiated urate-lowering therapy. We emulated a hypothetical trial comparing the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) among seven different strategies over 24 months. Three aspects were considered in defining increasingly intensive strategies: (1) continuation of urate-lowering therapy, (2) serum urate monitoring, and (3) modification of urate-lowering therapy when serum urate >6 mg/dl. We applied the ""clone-censor-weight"" method to account for baseline and time-varying confounding. RESULTS: We identified 4402 patients with gout who initiated urate-lowering therapy (mean age 77; male 60%). During a total of 6611 person-years (PY) of follow-up under usual care, the rate of major cardiovascular events (first and recurrent) was 4.5/100 PY (95% CI = 4.0, 5.1). The rate ratios (RRs) suggested reductions (RR point estimates 0.88-0.84) compared with usual care. All 95% CIs were imprecise, but their upper bounds excluded substantial increase in RRs. RRs were closer to 1.0 for the analysis focusing on the first major adverse cardiovascular event during follow-up and on comparison to the strategy requiring continuation of urate-lowering therapy (but not necessarily titration). CONCLUSIONS: Our treatment strategy trial emulation did not find increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with intensive urate-lowering strategies. Results may provide reassurance of the cardiovascular safety of intensive treat-to-target serum urate strategies recommended by rheumatology societies.","From the Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Department of  Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; OM1, Inc., Boston, MA.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.; Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Boston, MA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

37507510,"There is concern regarding the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) on suicidal behaviour. Using the target trial framework, we investigated the effect on suicidal behaviour of SSRI treatment following a depression diagnosis. We identified 162,267 individuals receiving a depression diagnosis aged 6-59 years during 2006-2018 in Stockholm County, Sweden, after at least 1 year without antidepressant dispensation. Individuals who initiated an SSRI within 28 days of the diagnosis were assigned as SSRI initiators, others as non-initiators. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects were estimated; for the latter, individuals were censored when they ceased adhering to their assigned treatment strategy. We applied inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for baseline confounding in the intention-to-treat analysis, and additionally for treatment non-adherence and time-varying confounding in the per-protocol analysis. The suicidal behaviour risk difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR) between SSRI initiators and non-initiators were estimated at 12 weeks. In the overall cohort, we found an increased risk of suicidal behaviour among SSRI initiators (intention-to-treat RR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.25, 1.80; per-protocol RR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.20, 2.36). In age strata, we only found evidence of an increased risk among individuals under age 25, with the greatest risk among 6-17-year-olds (intention-to-treat RR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.72, 4.91; per-protocol RR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.59, 7.00). Our finding of an increased suicidal behaviour risk among individuals under age 25 reflects evidence from RCTs. We found no evidence of an effect in the high-risk group of individuals with past suicidal behaviour. Further studies with information on a wider array of confounders are called for.","Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden. tyra.lagerberg@ki.se.; Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.  tyra.lagerberg@ki.se.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.",10.1038/s41386-023-01676-3 [pii]; 1676 [pii]; 10.1038/s41386-023-01676-3 [doi],Lagerberg T; Matthews AA; Zhu N; Fazel S; Carrero JJ; Chang Z,ORCID: 0000-0002-5383-5365; ORCID: 0000-0003-4763-2024,© 2023.

40166010,"Observational studies provide the only evidence on the effectiveness of  interventions when randomized controlled trials (RCTs) - apart from the initial RCT that establishes the efficacy of a treatment compared to a placebo - are impractical due to cost, ethical concerns, or time constraints. While many methodologies aim to draw causal inferences from observational data, there is a growing trend to model observational study designs after hypothetical or existing RCTs, a strategy known as ""target trial emulation."" Despite its potential, causal inference through target trial emulation is challenging because it cannot fully address the confounding bias inherent in real-world data due to the lack of randomization. In this work, we present a novel framework for target trial emulation that aims to overcome several key limitations, including confounding bias. The framework proceeds as follows: First, we apply the eligibility criteria of a specific trial to an observational cohort derived from real-world data. We then ""correct"" this cohort by extracting a subset that, through optimization techniques, matches both the distribution of covariates and baseline prognoses (i.e., the prognosis in the trial's control group) of the target RCT. Next, we address unmeasured confounding by adjusting the prognosis estimates of the treated group to align with those observed in the trial, using cost-sensitive counterfactual models. Following trial emulation, we go a step further by leveraging the emulated cohort to train optimal decision trees, developed by our team, to identify subgroups of patients exhibiting heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE). The absence of confounding is verified using two external models, and the validity of the treatment effects estimated by our framework is independently confirmed by the team responsible for the original trial we emulate. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to successfully address both observed and unobserved confounding, a challenge that has historically limited the use of randomized trial emulation and causal inference in general since the 1950s. Additionally, our framework holds promise in advancing precision or personalized medicine by identifying patient subgroups that benefit most from specific treatments.","Sloan School of Management and Operations Research Center, E62-560, Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.; Sloan School of Management and Operations Research Center, E62-560, Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.; National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Sloan School of Management and Operations Research Center, E62-560, Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.; National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Sloan School of Management and Operations Research Center, E62-560, Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.; Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,  10065, USA.",rs.3.rs-5576146 [pii]; 10.21203/rs.3.rs-5576146/v1 [doi],Bertsimas D; Koulouras A; Nagata H; Gao C; Mizusawa J; Kanemitsu Y; Margonis GA,ORCID: 0000-0003-0902-9208; ORCID: 0000-0001-8123-5298; ORCID: 0000-0003-4894-5743,,,,Competing interests The authors declare no competing interests.,,2025/04/01 04:57,,20250319,2025 Mar 19,2025/04/01 06:26,,,"Bertsimas, Dimitris; Koulouras, Angelos; Nagata, Hiroshi; Gao, Carol; Mizusawa, Junki; Kanemitsu, Yukihide; Margonis, Georgios Antonios",,P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,,,2693-5015,2693-5015,,101768035,Research square,eng,rs.3.rs-5576146 [pii]; 10.21203/rs.3.rs-5576146/v1 [doi],20250424,,2025/04/01 06:27,,,,,,NLM,,,2025/04/01 04:57,2025/04/01 06:27,,2025/03/31 00:00,2025/04/01 06:26,,United States,PMC11957197,2025/03/31,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,Res Sq [Preprint]. 2025 Mar 19:rs.3.rs-5576146. doi: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-5576146/v1.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Res Sq,The R.O.A.D. to clinical trial emulation.,,,,
39908569,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) are antidiabetic agents  recently approved for weight loss. Obesity is an established risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Moreover, preclinical studies have shown that GLP1-RA may attenuate thromboxane-induced platelet activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that GLP1-RA use may reduce the risk of VTE. We performed a target trial emulation (TTE) using a population-based database of electronic health records to evaluate whether GLP1-RA use is associated with a reduction in VTE in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i). Patients who were newly initiated on GLP1-RA were propensity score matched to patients who were newly initiated on DPP4i. We evaluated the primary outcome, composite VTE, identified using ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes, within 12 months of the initiation of GLP1-RA or DPP4i. The study cohort comprised 540 258 patients with 270 129 individuals receiving either GLP1-RA or DPP4i. Over 12 months of follow-up, patients who received GLP1-RA had a lower incidence of VTE compared with patients who received DPP4i (6.1 vs 7.6 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.83). This was similar for pulmonary embolism (2.9 vs 3.8 events per 1000 patient-years; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68-0.82) and deep vein thrombosis (3.9 vs 4.7 events per 1000 patient-years; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.88).

40064300,"AIMS: To compare the effects of low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel on the risk of  incident type 2 diabetes among patients with ASCVD. METHODS: This target trial emulation study was performed usingthe IQVIA Medical Research Data UK primary care database, including adults with an incident first ASCVD event who initiated low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel between 2004 and 2021. We applied an overlap weighting approach to balance treatment groups. The observational analogues of intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects were estimated using pooled logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 111,292 ASCVD patients who initiated aspirin (n = 78,012) or clopidogrel (n = 33,280) were included. In intention-to-treat analyses, aspirin and clopidogrel had similar risks of diabetes (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.02, 95 % Confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 1.07), cardiovascular events (1.00, 0.95 to 1.05), and bleeding events (1.02, 0.97 to 1.08). In per-protocol analyses, risks remained comparable for diabetes (1.06, 0.97 to 1.15), cardiovascular events (0.96, 0.89 to 1.03), and bleeding events (1.01, 0.92 to 1.10).

The choice between these agents may thus be influenced more by factors like cost, patient preference, or tolerance than by clinical outcomes alone.","Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, United Kingdom; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, United Kingdom; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of  Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Preclinical Medicine and Clinical  Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.; School of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and  Technology Park, Hong Kong, China; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology & Dynamics, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China; Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Advanced Data Analytics for Medical Science (ADAMS) Limited, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D(2)4H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China; Department of Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China; The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, Shenzhen, China.

36910458,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of covid-19 vaccination on the severity of  symptoms in patients with long covid. DESIGN: Target trial emulation based on ComPaRe e-cohort. DATA SOURCE: ComPaRe long covid cohort, a nationwide e-cohort (ie, a cohort where recruitment and follow-up are performed online) of patients with long covid, in France. METHODS: Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) enrolled in the ComPaRe cohort before 1 May 2021 were included in the study if they reported a confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptoms persistent for >3 weeks after onset, and at least one symptom attributable to long covid at baseline. Patients who received a first covid-19 vaccine injection were matched with an unvaccinated control group in a 1:1 ratio according to their propensity scores. Number of long covid symptoms, rate of complete remission of long covid, and proportion of patients reporting an unacceptable symptom state at 120 days were recorded. RESULTS: 910 patients were included in the analyses (455 in the vaccinated group and 455 in the control group). By 120 days, vaccination had reduced the number of long covid symptoms (mean 13.0 (standard deviation 9.4) in the vaccinated group v 14.8 (9.8) in the control group; mean difference -1.8, 95% confidence interval -3.0 to -0.5) and doubled the rate of patients in remission (16.6% v 7.5%, hazard ratio 1.93, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 3.14). Vaccination reduced the effect of long covid on patients' lives (mean score on the impact tool 24.3 (standard deviation 16.7) v 27.6 (16.7); mean difference -3.3, 95% confidence interval -5.7 to -1.0) and the proportion of patients with an unacceptable symptom state (38.9% v 46.4%, risk difference -7.4%, 95% confidence interval -14.5% to -0.3%). In the vaccinated group, two (0.4%) patients reported serious adverse events requiring admission to hospital. CONCLUSION: In this study, covid-19 vaccination reduced the severity of symptoms and the effect of long covid on patients' social, professional, and family lives at 120 days in those with persistent symptoms of infection.","Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAE, Center  for Research in Epidemiology and StatisticS (CRESS), F-75004 Paris, France.; Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, AP-HP, Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, F-75004 Paris,  France.; Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, AP-HP, Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, F-75004 Paris,  France.; Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, AP-HP, Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, F-75004 Paris,  France.; Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, AP-HP, Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, F-75004 Paris,  France.; Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health,  New York, New York, USA.",bmjmed-2022-000229 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjmed-2022-000229 [doi],Tran VT; Perrodeau E; Saldanha J; Pane I; Ravaud P,ORCID: 0000-0003-1863-6739,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

35850425,"OBJECTIVES: We aim to use real-world data in evidence synthesis to optimize an  evidence base for the effectiveness of biologic therapies in rheumatoid arthritis to allow for evidence on first-line therapies to inform second-line effectiveness estimates. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We use data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis to supplement randomized controlled trials evidence obtained from the literature, by emulating target trials of treatment sequences to estimate treatment effects in each line of therapy. Treatment effects estimates from the target trials inform a bivariate network meta-analysis (NMA) of first-line and second-line treatments. RESULTS: Summary data were obtained from 21 trials of biologic therapies including two for second-line treatment and results from six emulated target trials of both treatment lines. Bivariate NMA resulted in a decrease in uncertainty around the effectiveness estimates of the second-line therapies, when compared to the results of univariate NMA, and allowed for predictions of treatment effects not evaluated in second-line randomized controlled trials. CONCLUSION: Bivariate NMA provides effectiveness estimates for all treatments in first and second line, including predicted effects in second line where these estimates did not exist in the data. This novel methodology may have further applications; for example, for bridging networks of trials in children and adults.","Biostatistics Research Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of  Leicester, University Road, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK.

34945788,"This study aims to develop and validate the use of machine learning-based  prediction models to select individualized pharmacological treatment for patients with depressive disorder. This study used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with incident depressive disorders were included in this study. The study outcome was treatment failure, which was defined as psychiatric hospitalization, self-harm hospitalization, emergency visits, or treatment change. Prediction models based on the Super Learner ensemble were trained separately for the initial and the next-step treatments if the previous treatments failed. An individualized treatment strategy was developed for selecting the drug with the lowest probability of treatment failure for each patient as the model-selected regimen. We emulated clinical trials to estimate the effectiveness of individualized treatments. The area under the curve of the prediction model using Super Learner was 0.627 and 0.751 for the initial treatment and the next-step treatment, respectively. Model-selected regimens were associated with reduced treatment failure rates, with a 0.84-fold (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.86) decrease for the initial treatment and a 0.82-fold (95% CI 0.80-0.83) decrease for the next-step.

39848674,"BACKGROUND: Whether bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase is beneficial  compared with thrombectomy alone in patients who had a stroke with large-vessel occlusion remains unclear. METHODS: This is a causal inference study of observational data from the trials SWIFT DIRECT and EXTEND-IA TNK Parts 1 and 2 applying target trial emulation. We compared patients receiving thrombectomy alone to patients receiving tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or 0.40 mg/kg before thrombectomy. The primary outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included improvement over the full ordinal mRS scale, freedom of disability (mRS 0-1), mortality and occurrence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. The average causal treatment effect was estimated via inverse probability of treatment weighting and G-Computation. We calculated standardised risk differences (SRDs) and adjusted (common) ORs (a(c)ORs). RESULTS: Of 377 patients included in the target trial, 187 received thrombectomy alone and 190 tenecteplase before thrombectomy. Tenecteplase before thrombectomy did not increase the probability of patients achieving functional independence (SRD 0.04 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.13)) but resulted in a significant improvement in the mRS overall (acOR 1.56 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.23)) and in a higher probability of freedom from disability (SRD 0.10 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.20)). The probability for improvement of functional outcomes was further increased in patients treated within 140 min after onset (ordinal mRS acOR 1.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.56)). No significant differences in safety outcomes were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Tenecteplase before thrombectomy compared with thrombectomy alone did not increase the probability of functional independence but resulted in significant improvement over the full mRS scale. This improvement was most evident in patients treated early.","Department of Medicine and Neurology, Melbourne Brain Centre at The Royal  Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia valerian.altersberger@mh.org.au.; Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, University Hospital Basel and  University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; University Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, University  Hospital of Bern, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Medicine and Neurology, Melbourne Brain Centre at The Royal  Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Medicine and Neurology, Melbourne Brain Centre at The Royal  Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Division of Neurology, The Ottawa Hospital and Ottawa Research Institute,  University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; University Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, University  Hospital of Bern, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Neurology, Helsinki University Hospital, and University of  Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Bern, University of Bern, Bern,  Switzerland.; Department of Radiology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria,  Australia.; Department of Neurology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia,  Australia.; Department of Medicine and Neurology, Melbourne Brain Centre at The Royal  Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, University Hospital Basel and  University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Bern, University of Bern, Bern,  Switzerland.",jnnp-2024-335325 [pii]; 10.1136/jnnp-2024-335325 [doi],Altersberger VL; Kaesmacher J; Churilov L; Yogendrakumar V; Gralla J; Strbian D; Seiffge DJ; Mitchell PJ; Kleinig TJ; Campbell BC; Fischer U,ORCID: 0000-0002-0610-9328; ORCID: 0000-0002-9177-2289; ORCID: 0000-0003-3890-3849; ORCID: 0000-0003-3632-9433,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

38450806,"PURPOSE: A recent observational study suggested statins could reduce cancer  diagnosis in patients with heart failure (HF). The findings need to be validated using robust epidemiological methods. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of statin treatment on the risk of cancer in patients with HF. METHODS: We conducted two target trial emulations using primary care data from IQVIA Medical Research Database-UK (2000 to 2019) with a clone-censor-weight design. The first emulated trial addressed the treatment initiation effect: initiating within 1 year versus not initiating a statin after the HF diagnosis. The second emulated trial addressed the cumulative exposure effect: continuing a statin for ≤3 years, 3-6 years, and >6 years after initiation. The study outcomes were any incident cancer and site-specific cancer diagnoses. Weighted pooled logistic regression models were used to estimate 10-year risk ratios (RR). 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: The first emulated trial showed that, compared to no statin, statins did not reduce the cancer risk in patients with HF (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.15). The second emulated trial showed that, compared to treatment ≤3 years, statins with longer durations did not reduce the cancer risk (3-6 years: RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.70-1.33. >6 years: RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.26). No significant risk difference was observed on any site-specific cancer diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the target trial emulations suggest that statin treatment is not associated with cancer risk in patients with HF.","Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, UK.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, UK.; Centre for Medicines Optimisation Research and Education, University College  London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science Park, Hong  Kong, SAR, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, UK.; Centre for Medicines Optimisation Research and Education, University College  London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; Pharmacy Department, University College London Hospital NHS Trust, London, UK.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science Park, Hong  Kong, SAR, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China.; Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.; MEMO Research, Division of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Dundee,  Dundee, UK.; Department of Cardiology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust,  London, UK.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, UK.; Centre for Medicines Optimisation Research and Education, University College  London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science Park, Hong  Kong, SAR, China.",10.1002/pds.5775 [doi],Ju C; Lau WCY; Chambers P; Man KKC; Forster MD; Mackenzie IS; Manisty C; Wei L,ORCID: 0000-0003-2320-0470; ORCID: 0000-0001-8840-7267,© 2024 The Authors.

In this article, we use a linked claims and electronic health record database to comprehensively explore repurposing effects of antihypertensive drugs. We follow a target trial emulation framework for causal inference to emulate randomized controlled trials estimating confounding adjusted effects of antihypertensives on each of 262 outcomes of interest. We then fit hierarchical models to the results as a form of postprocessing to account for multiple comparisons and to sift through the results in a principled way. Our motivation is twofold. We seek both to surface genuinely intriguing drug repurposing opportunities and to elucidate through a real application some study design decisions and potential biases that arise in this context.","Division of Healthcare and Life Sciences, IBM Research, Armonk, New York, USA.; MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, CUNY School of Public Health, New  York City, New York, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; Engineering Systems, MIT Institute for Data Systems, and Society, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; Division of Healthcare and Life Sciences, IBM Research, Armonk, New York, USA.; MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Operations Research and Statistics, MIT Sloan School of Management, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Engineering Systems, MIT Institute for Data Systems, and Society, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA.; Division of Clinical Informatics, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston,  Massachusetts, USA.",PDS5491 [pii]; 10.1002/pds.5491 [doi],Shahn Z; Spear P; Lu H; Jiang S; Zhang S; Deshmukh N; Xu S; Ng K; Welsch R; Finkelstein S,,© 2022 The Authors.

37953303,"BACKGROUND: Subclinical hypothyroidism is diagnosed when serum thyroid  stimulating hormone levels are higher whilst free thyroxine levels remain within their respective reference ranges. These reference ranges are uniformly applied in all adults, despite serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels naturally increasing with age. Research has found that mildly elevated thyroid stimulating hormone levels may be associated with some benefits in ageing patients, including reduced mortality and better cardiorespiratory fitness. Levothyroxine is typically prescribed to patients with hypothyroidism, but no conclusive evidence exists on whether levothyroxine therapy is beneficial or detrimental in older subclinical hypothyroid patients. Despite this, prescriptions for levothyroxine are increasing year-on-year. This study aims to determine if receiving levothyroxine affects the cardiovascular and bone health outcomes of subclinical patients in primary care aged 50 years and over. METHODS: This project includes a retrospective cohort analysis and a target trial emulation study using electronic patient records collected between 2006 and 2021 and recorded in The Health Improvement Network database. The primary outcome of this study is to compare the cardiovascular outcomes of subclinical hypothyroid patients aged over 50 years treated with levothyroxine compared to those untreated. Secondary outcomes are bone health and all-cause mortality outcomes. Descriptive and inferential statistics will both be employed to analyse the data. Secondary analysis will explore confounding factors, including age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, co-morbidities, and levothyroxine dosage. DISCUSSION: There needs to be a greater understanding of the potential risks of the current treatment for older patients with subclinical hypothyroidism in a primary care setting. We will investigate the clinical importance of this issue and whether older subclinical hypothyroid patients have poorer outcomes when treated. Clarifying this concern may help address the healthcare resource implications of ageing patients being misclassified as having mild hypothyroidism, as these patients are more likely to repeat their blood tests. This could reduce prescription wastage and improve patient outcomes and quality of life in the ageing population.

39687920,"BACKGROUND: Prior nonrandomized studies have suggested nephroprotective effects  of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) formation, but these are plausibly susceptible to immortal time and selection biases. METHODS: We studied patients attending nephrology clinics in the West of Scotland during 2010-22 with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and no prior AVF. Using target trial emulation and a sequential trial design, we simulated a hypothetical trial that would randomize patients to either undergo AVF formation immediately or not to undergo AVF formation. The primary outcome was the difference in eGFR slope for the first 6 months of follow-up, estimated using a mixed-effects model. The secondary outcomes were 5-year absolute risks of dialysis and death, estimated using the Aalen-Johansen and Kaplan-Meier estimators respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1364 unique patients (mean age 51.1 years, 55.7% male) contributed 3125 person-trials, with 561 in the AVF and 2564 in the no AVF group. Mean eGFR was 12.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and the median number of eGFR measurements per person-trial was 7 (interquartile range 4-12). Slope of eGFR decline did not differ significantly between the AVF and no AVF groups (between-group difference -0.67 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year, 95% CI -1.43, 0.10). The 5-year absolute risk of dialysis was 87% (95% CI 84, 91) in the AVF group and 75% (95% CI 73, 77) in the no AVF group, and the 5-year survival probability was 77% (95% CI 70, 83) in the AVF group and 67% (95% CI 64, 69) in the no AVF group.

37582724,"BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is involved in migraine  pathophysiology and blood pressure regulation. Although clinical trials have established the cardio-cerebrovascular safety profile of anti-CGRP treatment, limited high-quality real-world evidence exists on its long-term effects on blood pressure (BP). To address this gap, we examined the safety of anti-CGRP treatment on BP in patients with migraine headache in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). METHODS: We emulated a target trial of patients who initiated anti-CGRP treatment or topiramate for migraine prevention between May 17th, 2018 and February 28th, 2023. We calculated stabilized inverse probability weights to balance between groups and then used weighted linear mixed-effect models to estimate the systolic and diastolic BP changes over the study period. For patients without hypertension at baseline, we estimated the cumulative incidence of hypertension using Kaplan-Meier curve. We also used weight mixed-effect Poisson model to estimate the number of antihypertension medications for patients with hypertension at baseline. RESULTS: This analysis included 69,589 patients and 554,437 blood pressure readings. of these, 18,880 patients received anti-CGRP treatment, and they were more likely to be women, have a chronic migraine diagnosis and higher healthcare utilization than those received topiramate. Among patients without hypertension at baseline, we found no significant differences in systolic BP changes over the four-year follow-up between anti-CGRP (slope [standard error, SE] = 0.48[0.06]) and topiramate treated patients (slope[SE] = 0.39[0.04]). The incidence of hypertension was similar for anti-CGRP and topiramate group (4.4 vs 4.3 per 100 person-years). Among patients with hypertension at baseline who initiated anti-CGRP treatment, we found a small but persistent effect on exacerbating hypertension during the first four years of treatment, as evidenced by a significant annual 3.7% increase in the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed (RR = 1.037, 95%CI 1.025-1.048). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that anti-CGRP treatment is safe regarding blood pressure in patients without hypertension. However, for those with baseline hypertension, anti-CGRP treatment resulted in a small but persistent increase in the number of antihypertensives, indicating an exacerbation of hypertension. Future studies are needed to evaluate the cardio-cerebrovascular safety of anti-CGRP treatment beyond the first four years.","Department of Veterans Affairs, Research, Education, Evaluation and Engagement  Activities Center for Headache, Headache Centers of Excellence, Orange, CT, USA. kaicheng.wang@va.gov.; Yale Center for Analytical Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, 300 George St  STE 511, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. kaicheng.wang@va.gov.; Department of Veterans Affairs, Research, Education, Evaluation and Engagement  Activities Center for Headache, Headache Centers of Excellence, Orange, CT, USA.; Pain Research, Informatics, Multi-Morbidities, and Education Center, VA  Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.; Pharmacy Benefits Management Services, VA Minneapolis Health Care System,  Minneapolis, MN, USA.; Headache Center of Excellence, VA Minneapolis Health Care System, Minneapolis,  MN, USA.; Pharmacy Benefits Management Services, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West  Haven, CT, USA.; Headache Center of Excellence, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT,  USA.; Department of Veterans Affairs, Research, Education, Evaluation and Engagement  Activities Center for Headache, Headache Centers of Excellence, Orange, CT, USA.; Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Veterans Affairs, Research, Education, Evaluation and Engagement  Activities Center for Headache, Headache Centers of Excellence, Orange, CT, USA.; Department of Veterans Affairs, Research, Education, Evaluation and Engagement  Activities Center for Headache, Headache Centers of Excellence, Orange, CT, USA.; Headache Center of Excellence, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT,  USA.; Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.",10.1186/s10194-023-01640-y [pii]; 1640 [pii]; 10.1186/s10194-023-01640-y [doi],Wang K; Fenton BT; Dao VX; Guirguis AB; Anthony SE; Skanderson M; Sico JJ,,"© 2023.

39111517,"BACKGROUND: The effect of primary cytoreductive surgery vs interval cytoreductive  surgery on International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV ovarian cancer outcomes remains uncertain and may vary depending on the stage and the location of extraperitoneal metastasis. Emulating target trials through causal assessment, combined with propensity score adjustment, has become a leading method for evaluating interventions using observational data. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of primary vs interval cytoreductive surgery on progression-free and overall survival in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV ovarian cancer using target trial emulation. STUDY DESIGN: Using the comprehensive French national health insurance database, we emulated a target trial to explore the causal impacts of primary vs interval cytoreductive surgery on stage IV ovarian cancer prognosis (Surgery for Ovarian cancer FIGO 4: SOFI-4). The clone method with inverse probability of censoring weighting was used to adjust for informative censoring and to balance baseline characteristics between the groups. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the stages and extraperitoneal metastasis locations. The study included patients younger than 75 years of age, in good health condition, who were diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2022. The primary and secondary outcomes were respectively 5-year progression-free survival and 7-year overall survival. RESULTS: Among the 2772 patients included in the study, 948 (34.2%) were classified as having stage IVA ovarian cancer and 1824 (65.8%) were classified as having stage IVB ovarian cancer at inclusion. Primary cytoreductive surgery was performed for 1182 patients (42.6%), whereas interval cytoreductive surgery was conducted for 1590 patients (57.4%). The median progression-free survival for primary cytoreductive surgery was 19.7 months (interquartile range, 19.3-20.1) as opposed to 15.7 months (interquartile range, 15.7-16.1) for those who underwent interval cytoreductive surgery. The median overall survival was 63.1 months (interquartile range, 61.7-65.4) for primary cytoreductive surgery in comparison with 55.6 months (interquartile range, 53.8-56.3) for interval cytoreductive surgery. The findings of our study indicate that primary cytoreductive surgery is associated with a 5.0-month increase in the 5-year progression-free survival (95% confidence interval, 3.8-6.2) and a 3.9-month increase in 7-year overall survival (95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.2). These survival benefits of primary over interval cytoreductive surgery were observed in both the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IVA and IVB subgroups. Primary cytoreductive surgery demonstrated improved progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with pleural, supradiaphragmatic, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSION: This study advocates for the benefits of primary cytoreductive surgery over interval cytoreductive surgery for patients with stage IV ovarian cancer and suggests that extraperitoneal metastases like supradiaphragmatic or extra-abdominal lymph nodes should not automatically preclude primary cytoreductive surgery consideration in suitable patients.","Residual Tumor & Response to Treatment Laboratory, Translational Research  Department, INSERM, U932 Immunity and Cancer, Paris, France; Department of Gynaecology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.

40201798,"BACKGROUND: Reducing risk of cardiovascular disease is crucial in managing type 2  diabetes (T2D). This study assessed the comparative cardiovascular effectiveness of newer glucose-lowering drugs in real-world elderly individuals with T2D, and examined how age modified these effects. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using Danish nationwide registries to emulate a three-arm randomized clinical trial. Participants aged ≥70 years were new users of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), between 2012 and 2020. We estimated the overall and age-specific incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (3P-MACE) and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) using Poisson regression models. Summarized weights were used to balance baseline characteristics and treatment adherence. FINDINGS: The study included 35,679 participants (DPP-4is: 21,848 (62%), GLP1-RAs: 5702 (16%), SGLT-2is: 8129 (23%)). In the as-treated analysis, GLP1-RAs and SGLT-2is were associated with significantly reduced rates of 3P-MACE and HHF compared to DPP-4is. The overall IRR for 3P-MACE was 0.68 (95% CI 0.65-0.71) (GLP1-RAs vs. DPP4is) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.63-0.68) (SGLT-2is vs. DPP4is), while for HHF the IRR was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.88) (GLP1-RAs vs. DPP4is) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.55-0.66) (SGLT-2is vs. DPP4is). These effects were predominantly independent of age. No significant difference was observed between SGLT-2is and GLP1-RAs on 3P-MACE, however, SGLT-2is were associated with a significant reduction of HHF, compared to GLP1-RAs, with an overall IRR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67-0.83), and with age-dependent variations for both outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In the elderly, use of GLP1-RAs and SGLT-2is was associated with reduced rates of 3P-MACE and HHF compared to DPP-4is, independent of age. SGLT-2is were also associated with reduced rates of HHF compared to GLP1-RAs, largely independent of age, in this population of individuals aged 70 years and above. This provides real-world evidence on the comparative cardiovascular effectiveness of the three most recent glucose-lowering medications and may help strengthen implementation of guidelines into clinical practice.

40388602,"BACKGROUND: The association of metformin with mortality has been mixed, and no  prior study has determined whether metformin initiation is associated with exceptional longevity, defined as survival to ages 90 and older. METHODS: We performed a new-user, active comparator cohort study using the target trial emulation framework among the Women's Health Initiative cohort to determine whether metformin versus sulfonylurea initiation was associated with exceptional longevity (survival to age 90). We identified participants ≥60 years with incident type 2 diabetes and no history of hypoglycemic agents or insulin prior to treatment initiation to perform intention-to-treat analyses. We used 1:1 propensity score matching on demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, diabetes duration, comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer), body mass index, and concomitant medications to balance treatment groups on key confounders. RESULTS: Among 438 propensity score-matched women with type 2 diabetes, the incidence rate of death before age 90 per 100 person-years in women initiating metformin monotherapy was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1-4.4) compared with 5.0 (95% CI: 4.2-5.8) for sulfonylurea monotherapy. The adjusted risk of death before age 90 was 30% lower for initiation of metformin monotherapy versus sulfonylurea monotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this first target trial emulation of metformin and exceptional longevity, we found that metformin initiation increased exceptional longevity compared with sulfonylurea initiation among women with type 2 diabetes. Because this comparison was not made to placebo in a randomized controlled trial and given the observational design with potential for residual confounding, causality cannot be inferred.","Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, University  of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Division of Geriatrics, Gerontology, and Palliative Care, Department of Medicine,  University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine,  Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, Wake Forest University School of  Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California Irvine,  Irvine, California, USA.; Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

36561190,"BACKGROUND: Information about the effectiveness of oral antivirals in preventing  short- and long-term COVID-19-related outcomes during the Omicron surge is limited. We sought to determine the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir for the outpatient treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted three retrospective target trial emulation studies comparing matched patient cohorts who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no treatment, molnupiravir versus no treatment, and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus molnupiravir in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Participants were Veterans in VHA care at risk for severe COVID-19 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the outpatient setting during January and February 2022. Primary outcomes included all-cause 30-day hospitalization or death and 31-180-day incidence of acute or long-term care admission, death, or post-COVID-19 conditions. For 30-day outcomes, we calculated unadjusted risk rates, risk differences, and risk ratios. For 31-180-day outcomes, we used unadjusted time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: Participants were 90% male with median age 67 years and 26% unvaccinated. Compared to matched untreated controls, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir-treated participants (N=1,587) had a lower 30-day risk of hospitalization (27.10/1000 versus 41.06/1000, risk difference [RD] - 13.97, 95% CI -23.85 to -4.09) and death (3.15/1000 versus 14.86/1000, RD -11.71, 95% CI - 16.07 to -7.35). Among persons who were alive at day 31, further significant reductions in 31-180-day incidence of hospitalization (sub-hazard ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.37) or death (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.08) were not observed. Molnupiravir-treated participants aged â‰¥65 years (n=543) had a lower combined 30-day risk of hospitalization or death (55.25/1000 versus 82.35/1000, RD -27.10, 95% CI -50.63 to -3.58). A statistically significant difference in 30-day or 31-180-day risk of hospitalization or death was not observed between matched nirmatrelvir- or molnupiravir-treated participants. Incidence of most post-COVID conditions was similar across comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was highly effective in preventing 30-day hospitalization and death. Short-term benefit from molnupiravir was observed in older groups. Significant reductions in adverse outcomes from 31-180 days were not observed with either antiviral.","Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, Portland, OR.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Oregon Health and  Sciences University, Portland, OR.; Research and Development, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System,  Seattle, WA.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP-CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP-CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT.; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP-CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP-CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT.; Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT.; Veterans Affairs Center for Medication Safety - Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM)  Services, Hines, IL.; Center of Innovation to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care (CIVIC), VA Portland  Healthcare System, Portland, OR.; Health Management and Policy, School of Social and Behavioral Health Sciences,  College of Public Health and Human Sciences; Health Data and Informatics Program, Center for Quantitative Life Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR.; Center of Innovation to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care (CIVIC), VA Portland  Healthcare System, Portland, OR.; Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann  Arbor, MI.; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.; Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center, Veterans Affairs Puget  Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA.; Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann  Arbor, MI.; Schools of Medicine and Public Health, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD.; Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation, Durham  VA Medical Center, Durham, NC.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine,  Durham, NC.; Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, Duke University, Durham, NC.; Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA.; Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.; Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann  Arbor, MI.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.; Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Epidemiology Research  Center (CSP-CERC), Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT.; Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Office of Research and Development, Veterans Health Administration, Washington,  DC.; Research and Development, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System,  Seattle, WA.; Divisions of Gastroenterology, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Healthcare System and  University of Washington, Seattle, WA.",2022.12.05.22283134 [pii]; 10.1101/2022.12.05.22283134 [doi],Bajema KL; Berry K; Streja E; Rajeevan N; Li Y; Yan L; Cunningham F; Hynes DM; Rowneki M; Bohnert A; Boyko EJ; Iwashyna TJ; Maciejewski ML; Osborne TF; Viglianti EM; Aslan M; Huang GD; Ioannou GN,,,,,,,2022/12/23 02:19,,20221216,2022 Dec 16,2022/12/24 06:00,,,"Bajema, Kristina L; Berry, Kristin; Streja, Elani; Rajeevan, Nallakkandi; Li, Yuli; Yan, Lei; Cunningham, Francesca; Hynes, Denise M; Rowneki, Mazhgan; Bohnert, Amy; Boyko, Edward J; Iwashyna, Theodore J; Maciejewski, Matthew L; Osborne, Thomas F; Viglianti, Elizabeth M; Aslan, Mihaela; Huang, Grant D; Ioannou, George N",,IK6 HX003395/HX/HSRD VA/United States,,,,,,101767986,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,eng,2022.12.05.22283134 [pii]; 10.1101/2022.12.05.22283134 [doi],20240618,,2022/12/24 06:01,,,,,,NLM,,,2022/12/23 02:19,2022/12/24 06:01,,2022/12/22 00:00,2022/12/24 06:00,,United States,PMC9774229,2022/12/22,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,medRxiv [Preprint]. 2022 Dec 16:2022.12.05.22283134. doi:  10.1101/2022.12.05.22283134.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,medRxiv,Effectiveness of COVID-19 treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or molnupiravir  among U.S. Veterans: target trial emulation studies with one-month and six-month outcomes.,,Ann Intern Med. 2023 Jun;176(6):807-816. doi: 10.7326/M22-3565.

34928700,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE)  in racially and ethnically diverse, elderly populations with high comorbidity burden. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccines. DESIGN: Target trial emulation study comparing newly vaccinated persons with matched unvaccinated controls. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Among persons receiving care in the Veterans Affairs health care system (n = 5 766 638), those who received at least 1 dose of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from 11 December 2020 to 25 March 2021 (n = 2 099 871) were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic, clinical, and geographic characteristics. INTERVENTION: Follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as death within 30 days of infection, began after the vaccination date or an identical index date for the matched unvaccinated controls and continued until up to 30 June 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2-related death. RESULTS: Vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were well matched; both were predominantly male (92.9% vs. 93.4%), had advanced age (mean, 68.7 years in both groups), had diverse racial and ethnic distribution (for example, Black: 17.3% vs. 17.0%, Hispanic: 6.5% vs. 6.1%), and had substantial comorbidity burden. Vaccine effectiveness 7 or more days after the second vaccine dose was 69% (95% CI, 67% to 70%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 86% (CI, 82% to 89%) against SARS-CoV-2-related death and was similar when follow-up was extended to 31 March versus 30 June. Vaccine effectiveness against infection decreased with increasing age and comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly male population and lack of data on SARS-CoV-2 variants. CONCLUSION: In an elderly, diverse, high-comorbidity population, COVID-19 VE against infection was substantially lower than previously reported, but VE against death was high. Complementary infection mitigation efforts remain important for pandemic control, even with vaccination.

37573202,"BACKGROUND: Although CoronaVac was the only Covid-19 vaccine adopted in the first  months of the Brazilian vaccination campaign, randomized clinical trials to evaluate its efficacy in elderly adults were limited. In this study, we use routinely collected surveillance and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and testing data comprising the population of the fifth largest city of Brazil to evaluate the effectiveness of CoronaVac in adults 60+ years old against severe outcomes. METHODS: Using large observational databases on vaccination and surveillance data from the city of Fortaleza, Brazil, we defined a retrospective cohort including 324,302 eligible adults aged ≥60 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine. The cohort included individuals vaccinated between January 21, 2021, and August 31, 2021, who were matched with unvaccinated persons at the time of rollout following a 1:1 ratio according to baseline covariates of age, sex, and Human Development Index of the neighborhood of residence. Only Covid-19-related severe outcomes were included in the analysis: hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. Vaccine effectiveness for each outcome was calculated by using the risk ratio between the two groups, with the risk obtained by the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: We obtained 62,643 matched pairs for assessing the effectiveness of the two-dose regimen of CoronaVac. The demographic profile of the matched population was statistically representative of the population of Fortaleza. Using the cumulative incidence as the risk associated with each group, starting at day 14 since the receipt of the second dose, we found an 82.3 % (95 % CI 66.3-93.9) effectiveness against Covid-19-related death, 68.4 % (95 % CI 42.3-86.4) against ICU admission, and 55.8 % (95 % CI 42.7-68.3) against hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that, despite critical delays in vaccine delivery and limited evidence in efficacy trial estimates, CoronaVac contributed to preventing deaths and severe morbidity due to Covid-19 in elderly adults.","Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil;  Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Fortaleza (SMS-Fortaleza), Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil.

37062294,"BACKGROUND: Although most children and adolescents have had a previous SARS-CoV-2  infection and many continue to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, studies of the effectiveness of hybrid immunity against reinfection with the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant are scarce. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of vaccination in convalescent children and adolescents against reinfection with the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and the BA.1 and BA.2 and BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was devised to emulate a target randomised control trial using a retrospective dataset of anonymised health records of children (5-11 years old) and adolescents (12-16 years old) who were members of the Maccabi Healthcare Services, Israel. The design emulated 91 randomised trials by devising a series of multiple nested trials, compiling the results into a single dataset, and fitting Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs of each measured outcome. The primary aim was to assess the protection from reinfection with the delta variant and the BA.1 and BA.2 and BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants associated with hybrid immunity as a result of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by vaccination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. FINDINGS: Data from between from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2022, for 163 812 individuals (120 721 children [59 404 girls and 61 317 boys], median age 8·0 years [IQR 6·7 to 10·2]; and 43 091 adolescents [21 239 girls and 21 852 boys], median age 13·5 years [12·6 to 14·8]) were included in at least one trial. A single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in convalescent children and adolescents confers statistically significant protection against the delta variant (78% [95% CI 72 to 83] in adolescents and 64% [3 to 87] in children) and the omicron BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants (54% [50 to 57] in adolescents and 71% [67 to 73] in children) compared with children who had a previous infection but were unvaccinated. However, the vaccine was not found to confer statistically significant protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants in adolescents (8% [-18 to 29]) and children (12% [-6 to 27]). INTERPRETATION: Decision makers in BA.4 and BA.5 dominant regions should re-examine whether convalescent individuals aged 5-16 years should receive the BNT162b2 vaccine to prevent future reinfection, especially in light of reports that show that most children and adolescents have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

39983079,"PURPOSE: Targeted therapy and immunotherapy promise improved survival in patients  with advanced melanoma, yet the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multigene panel sequencing compared with single-gene BRAF testing to guide therapeutic decisions is unknown. METHODS: Our population-based quasi-experimental retrospective target trial emulation used comprehensive patient-level data for 364 British Columbia, Canada, adults with an advanced melanoma diagnosis receiving multigene panel sequencing or single-gene BRAF testing between September 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018. We 1:1 matched multigene panel patients to controls using genetic algorithm-based matching. Outcomes included 3-year overall survival (OS) and health care costs (2021 Canadian dollars [CAD]) with incremental net monetary benefit for life-years gained (LYG). Outcomes were analyzed using inverse probability of censoring weighted linear regression for the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect. The per-protocol (PP) effect estimation also included stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights. We then used Weibull regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: We matched 147 multigene panel patients to controls, achieving balance for all covariates. After matching, ITT incremental costs were $19,447 CAD (95% CI, -$18,516 to $76,006) and incremental LYG were 0.22 (95% CI, -0.05 to 0.49). We found uncertainty in differences on OS using Kaplan-Meier (P = .11) and Weibull regression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.03]) in the ITT. PP incremental costs were $36,367 CAD (95% CI, -$6,653 to $120,216]) and incremental LYG were 0.56 (95% CI, 0.39 to 1.24), with corresponding differences in OS using Kaplan-Meier (P = .02) and Weibull regression (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.87]). The probability of multigene panels being cost-effective at $100,000/LYG CAD was 55% for ITT and 65% for PP. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of multigene panels was evenly poised at higher thresholds, even when accounting for treatment initiation. Health systems reimbursing multigene panels and expensive therapies may be confronted with a value tradeoff, in which there may be improved survival albeit with a modest change in cost-effectiveness.","Cancer Control Research, BC Cancer Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Cancer Control Research, BC Cancer Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC.; Department of Medical Oncology, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia,  Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Medical Oncology, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia,  Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of  British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Cancer Genetics & Genomics Laboratory, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of  British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Research Institute, Vancouver,  BC, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.; Department of Public Health Science, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.; Cancer Control Research, BC Cancer Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC.; Fraser Health, Surrey, BC, Canada.; Cancer Control Research, BC Cancer Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; School of Population and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of  British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",PO-24-00631 [pii]; 10.1200/PO-24-00631 [doi],Krebs E; Weymann D; Ho C; Weppler A; Bosdet I; Karsan A; Hanna TP; Pollard S; Regier DA,ORCID: 0000-0002-6590-8728; ORCID: 0000-0002-3072-5657; ORCID: 0000-0002-5922-3984; ORCID: 0000-0003-4739-007X; ORCID: 0000-0001-6753-892X; ORCID: 0000-0003-3228-6042; ORCID: 0000-0002-3070-2092; ORCID: 0000-0001-8876-0511,,,,"The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this  manuscript.

40499831,"AIM: To estimate the effect of a sustained physical activity intervention on  12-year risk of late-life depressive symptoms among older adults. METHODS: We emulated a target trial of a sustained intervention of moderate to vigorous physical activity at least twice a week using data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). The HRS included 10,735 eligible participants (57.5 % women; 65.8y ± 9.4) and the ELSA included 4898 participants (54.0 % women, 66.3y ± 9.2). We adjusted for pre-baseline, baseline and time-varying risk factors using parametric g-formula to estimate the 12-year risk of depressive symptoms under the physical activity intervention vs under natural course. RESULTS: The estimated 12-year risk of developing depressive symptoms was 44.3 % (95%CI: 36.2; 51.1) under natural course and 39.1 % (32.5; 45.9) under the physical activity intervention, resulting in a risk difference of -5.20 percentage points (-7.40; -2.37) in the HRS. In the ELSA, the risk was 64.8 % (58.9; 73.4) under natural course vs 56.1 % (49.3; 64.5) under the physical activity intervention, resulting in a risk difference of -8.70 percentage points (-11.78; -6.14). CONCLUSION: We estimated that older adults have experienced a lower incidence of depressive symptoms under a long-term sustained intervention of physical activity.","Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and  Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Center for Epidemiological Research in Nutrition and Health, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Universidade de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade  Federal de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Chronic Disease Epidemiology Research Center, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and  Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Sport and Human Movement Science, Centre for Sport Science and University Sports, University of Vienna, Wien, Austria.

35261970,"BACKGROUND: mRNA COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and  Moderna (mRNA-1273) have been shown to be efficacious but have not been compared in head-to-head clinical trials. METHODS: We designed this observational study to emulate a target trial of COVID-19 vaccination by BNT162b2 versus mRNA-1273 among persons who underwent vaccination in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system from 11/12/2020 to 25/03/2021 using combined VA and Medicare electronic health records. We identified the best matching mRNA-1273 recipient(s) for each BNT162b2 recipient, using exact/coarsened-exact matching (calendar week, VA integrated service network, age buckets and Charlson comorbidity index buckets) followed by propensity score matching. Vaccine recipients were followed from the date of first vaccine dose until 25/08/2021 for the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization or SARS-CoV-2-related death. FINDINGS: Each group included 902,235 well-matched vaccine recipients, followed for a mean of 192 days, during which 16,890 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 3591 SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and 381 SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were documented. Compared to BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 recipients had significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.736, 95% CI 0.696-0.779) and SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization (aHR 0.633, 95% CI 0.562-0.713), which persisted across all age groups, comorbidity burden categories and black/white race. The differences between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 in risk of infection or hospitalization were progressively greater when the follow-up period was longer, i.e. extending to March 31, June 30 or August 25, 2021. These differences were more pronounced when we analyzed separately the outcomes that occurred during the follow-up period from July 1 to August 25, 2021 when the Delta variant became predominant in the U.S. (aHR for infection 0.584, 95% CI 0.533-0.639 and aHR for hospitalization 0.387, 95% 0.311-0.482). SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were less common in mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 recipients (168 versus 213) but this difference was not statistically significant (aHR 0.808, 95% CI 0.592-1.103). INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, although absolute rates of infection, hospitalization and death in both vaccine groups were low regardless of the vaccine received, our data suggests that compared to BNT162b2, vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significantly lower rates of SARS-CoV-2-infection and SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization. These differences were greater with longer follow-up time since vaccination and even more pronounced in the Delta variant era.

39998658,"BACKGROUND: High-risk acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening  condition necessitating hemodynamic stabilization and rapid restoration of pulmonary perfusion. In this context, evidence regarding the benefit of advanced circulatory support and pulmonary recanalization strategies is still limited. METHODS: In this observational study, we assessed data of 1060 patients treated for high-risk acute PE with 991 being included in a target trial emulation to investigate all-cause in-hospital mortality estimates with different advanced treatment strategies. The four treatment groups consisted of patients undergoing (I) veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) alone (n = 126), (II) intrahospital systemic thrombolysis (SYS) (n = 643), (III) surgical thrombectomy (ST) (n = 49), and (IV) percutaneous catheter-directed treatment (PCDT) (n = 173). VA-ECMO was allowed as bridging to pulmonary recanalization in groups II, III, and IV. Marginal causal contrasts were estimated using the g-formula with logistic regression models as the primary approach. Sensitivity analyses included targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with machine learning, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), as well as variations of estimands, handling of missing values, and a complete target trial emulation excluding the VA-ECMO alone group. RESULTS: In the overall target trial population, the median age was 62.0 years, and 53.3% of patients were male. The estimated probability of in-hospital mortality from the primary target trial intention-to-treat analysis for VA-ECMO alone was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI] 47%; 67%), compared to 48% (95% CI 44%; 53%) for intrahospital SYS, 34% (95%CI 18%; 50%) for ST, and 43% (95% CI 35%; 51%) for PCDT. The mortality risk ratios were largely in favor of any advanced recanalization strategy over VA-ECMO alone. The robustness of these findings was supported by all sensitivity analyses. In the crude outcome analysis, patients surviving to discharge had a high probability of favorable neurologic outcome in all treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Advanced recanalization by means of SYS, ST, and several promising catheter-directed systems may have a positive impact on short-term survival of patients presenting with high-risk PE compared to the use of VA-ECMO alone as a bridge to recovery.","Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Klinik Für Herz-, Thorax- Und Herznahe  Gefäßchirurgie, University Medical Center Regensburg, Universitätsklinik Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.;

40488647,"INTRODUCTION: Anecdotal observations report a decrease in craving for alcohol  among patients taking glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA). We aimed to assess liver-related outcomes and mortality among individuals with harmful alcohol use who received GLP-1 RAs. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using the electronic health records of US Veterans with positive alcohol use disorders-concise score (AUDIT-C), comparing new initiators of GLP-1 RA between 1/3/2017 and 9/30/2024, with controls, with follow-up until outcomes or study end. Each GLP-1 RA new user with a positive AUDIT-C screen was propensity score (PS) matched 1:1 with a patient not on a GLP-1 RA. The primary outcomes were the time to a composite outcome of decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related death, and all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with positive AUDIT-C scores. RESULTS: We matched 8,040 patients with positive AUDIT-C initiated on GLP-1 RA with 8,040 noninitiators. GLP-1 RA use was associated with a lower risk of composite liver-related outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.87) and death (aHR 0.43, 95% CI 0.37-0.49). Among semaglutide users, a 1 mg/wk dose increase was associated with a reduced risk of composite liver-related outcomes (aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.88) and death (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.58). GLP-1 RA use was also associated with lower odds of positive AUDIT-C during follow-up (adjusted Odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.82). DISCUSSION: In this observational target trial emulation study, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a lower risk of liver outcomes, death, and harmful alcohol use.","Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Miami VA Health System, Miami,  Florida, USA.; Division of Digestive Health and Liver Diseases, University of Miami Miller  School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond,  Virginia, USA.; Department of Psychology, Miami VA Health System, Miami, Florida, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Ann Arbor VA Medical Center,  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Psychology, Miami VA Health System, Miami, Florida, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond,  Virginia, USA.; Department of Health Policy, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond,  Virginia, USA .",00000434-990000000-01790 [pii]; 10.14309/ajg.0000000000003585 [doi],John BV; Bastaich D; Marchetti D; Perumalswami P; Mustafa MZ; Dahman B,ORCID: 0000-0002-2002-9682; ORCID: 0000-0002-2182-2471; ORCID: 0000-0003-3070-3906; ORCID: 0000-0001-7209-5369,Copyright © 2025 by The American College of Gastroenterology.,,Veterans Analysis of Liver Disease (VALID) Group of Investigators,,,2025/06/09 10:13,,20250610,2025 Jun 10,2025/06/09 12:30,,,"John, Binu V; Bastaich, Dustin; Marchetti, Daniella; Perumalswami, Ponni; Mustafa, Mixael Zirio; Dahman, Bassam",,I01CX002654 01A1/Clinical Science Research and Development/; P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,,,1572-0241,0002-9270,,0421030,The American journal of gastroenterology,eng,10.14309/ajg.0000000000003585 [doi],20250711,,2025/06/09 12:30,,,,AUDIT-C; alcohol use disorder; alcohol-associated liver disease; semaglutide,NOTNLM,NLM,,2025/05/22 00:00,2025/06/09 10:13,2025/06/09 12:30,,,2025/06/09 12:30,2025/03/13 00:00,United States,,,aheadofprint,Journal Article,,IM,,Am J Gastroenterol. 2025 Jun 10. doi: 10.14309/ajg.0000000000003585.,Publisher,Am J Gastroenterol,Association of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists With Liver-Related  Outcomes and All-Cause Mortality in Patients With Harmful Alcohol Use: A Target Trial Emulation Study.,,,,
37833846,"BACKGROUND: There are scarce data on best practices to control for confounding in  observational studies assessing vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19. We compared the performance of three well-established methods [overlap weighting, inverse probability treatment weighting and propensity score (PS) matching] to minimize confounding when comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Subsequently, we conducted a target trial emulation to study the ability of these methods to replicate COVID-19 vaccine trials. METHODS: We included all individuals aged ≥75 from primary care records from the UK [Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) AURUM], who were not infected with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 as of 4 January 2021. Vaccination status was then defined based on first COVID-19 vaccine dose exposure between 4 January 2021 and 28 January 2021. Lasso regression was used to calculate PS. Location, age, prior observation time, regional vaccination rates, testing effort and COVID-19 incidence rates at index date were forced into the PS. Following PS weighting and matching, the three methods were compared for remaining covariate imbalance and residual confounding. Last, a target trial emulation comparing COVID-19 at 3 and 12 weeks after first vaccine dose vs unvaccinated was conducted. RESULTS: Vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts comprised 583 813 and 332 315 individuals for weighting, respectively, and 459 000 individuals in the matched cohorts. Overlap weighting performed best in terms of minimizing confounding and systematic error. Overlap weighting successfully replicated estimates from clinical trials for vaccine effectiveness for ChAdOx1 (57%) and BNT162b2 (75%) at 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: Overlap weighting performed best in our setting. Our results based on overlap weighting replicate previous pivotal trials for the two first COVID-19 vaccines approved in Europe.","Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics,  Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics,  Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics,  Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics,  Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics,  Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics,  Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam,  The Netherlands.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics,  Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.",7313664 [pii]; dyad138 [pii]; 10.1093/ije/dyad138 [doi],Català M; Burn E; Rathod-Mistry T; Xie J; Delmestri A; Prieto-Alhambra D; Jödicke AM,ORCID: 0000-0002-9286-1128; ORCID: 0000-0002-3950-6346,© The Author(s) 2023.

39030720,"There is mounting interest in the possibility that metformin, indicated for  glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, has a range of additional beneficial effects. Randomized trials have shown that metformin prevents adverse cardiovascular events, and metformin use has also been associated with reduced cognitive decline and cancer incidence. In this paper, we dig more deeply into whether metformin prevents cancer by emulating target randomized trials comparing metformin to sulfonylureas as first-line diabetes therapy using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a UK primary-care database (1987-2018). We included 93 353 individuals with diabetes, no prior cancer diagnosis, no chronic kidney disease, and no prior diabetes therapy who initiated use of metformin (n = 79 489) or a sulfonylurea (n = 13 864). In our cohort, the estimated overlap-weighted additive separable direct effect of metformin compared with sulfonylureas on cancer risk at 6 years was -1 percentage point (95% CI, -2.2 to 0.1), which is consistent with metformin's providing no direct protection against cancer incidence or substantial protection. The analysis faced 2 methodological challenges: (1) poor overlap and (2) precancer death as a competing risk. To address these issues while minimizing nuisance model misspecification, we develop and apply double/debiased machine learning estimators of overlap-weighted separable effects in addition to more traditional effect estimates.

40134633,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) include  ampicillin-sulbactam as an initial treatment option, though they do not mandate routine coverage of anaerobic organisms. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of ampicillin-sulbactam with that of ceftriaxone as initial treatment for CAP in older adults. METHODS: This study was conducted using the target trial emulation framework, using a nationwide Japanese database (May 2010-June 2023). The study included patients aged ≥65 years, admitted to Diagnosis Procedure Combination hospitals for CAP, who received either ampicillin-sulbactam or ceftriaxone as the initial treatment. The exposure group received ampicillin-sulbactam, while the control group received ceftriaxone, both on the day of hospitalization. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; the secondary outcome was the development of Clostridioides difficile infection during hospitalization. RESULTS: The study included 26 633 older patients hospitalized with CAP, with 14 906 receiving ampicillin-sulbactam and 11 727 receiving ceftriaxone as initial treatment. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, the ampicillin-sulbactam group was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate than the ceftriaxone group (10.5% vs 9.0%, respectively; adjusted risk difference, 1.5% [95% confidence interval, .7%-2.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.19 [1.08-1.31]). The incidence of C difficile infection was numerically higher in the ampicillin-sulbactam group (0.6% vs 0.4%; adjusted risk difference, 0.2% [95% confidence interval, .0%-.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.45 [.99-2.11]). These results were consistent among patients with risk factors for aspiration. CONCLUSIONS: In older patients with CAP, initial treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam was associated with higher mortality compared to treatment with ceftriaxone.","Department of Transformative Infection Control Development Studies, Osaka  University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Division of Fostering Required Medical Human Resources, Center for Infectious  Disease Education and Research (CiDER), Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.; Division of Infection Control and Prevention, Osaka University Hospital, Osaka,  Japan.; Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of  Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Scientific Research Works Peer Support Group (SRWS-PSG), Osaka, Japan.; Scientific Research Works Peer Support Group (SRWS-PSG), Osaka, Japan.; Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Min-iren Asukai Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.; Section of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Community Medicine, Kyoto  University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Healthcare Epidemiology, Kyoto University Graduate School of  Medicine/School of Public Health, Kyoto, Japan.; Scientific Research Works Peer Support Group (SRWS-PSG), Osaka, Japan.; Department of Healthcare Epidemiology, Kyoto University Graduate School of  Medicine/School of Public Health, Kyoto, Japan.",ofaf133 [pii]; 10.1093/ofid/ofaf133 [doi],Yamamoto S; Shiroshita A; Kataoka Y; Someko H,ORCID: 0000-0003-3207-8403; ORCID: 0000-0001-7982-5213; ORCID: 0000-0002-7195-2055,© The Author(s) 2025.

40343984,"BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely administered for contraception and  menopausal symptom management. However, its impact on psoriasis risk remains unclear, requiring an evaluation across diverse age groups to inform clinical practice and optimize treatment strategies. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between HT and the risk of psoriasis in reproductive-age and postmenopausal women. METHODS: This study utilized both nationwide cohort design and target trial emulation, analysing data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database (2001-2021). Women over 20 years old without a prior history of psoriasis, ovarian cancer or breast cancer were included, and categorized into reproductive-age (≤ 50 years) and postmenopausal (> 50 years) groups. Women who initiated HT were assigned as the exposed group, while women without HT formed the comparison group. The primary outcome was the incidence of psoriasis over a 5-year period. The study applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed to enhance the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: In the postmenopausal cohort, comprising 1 482 302 HT users and 1 313 799 nonusers, the IPTW-adjusted HR for psoriasis in the ITT analysis was 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-1.52]. The PP analysis indicated a more pronounced risk, with an HR of 5.93 (95% CI 5.66-6.22). Among the reproductive-age cohort, which included 3 849 721 HT users and 1 585 461 nonusers, the IPTW-adjusted HR in the ITT analysis was 1.93 (95% CI 1.90-1.99). In the PP analysis, the risk increased, showing an HR of 7.85 (95% CI 7.56-8.15). These findings highlight the significantly elevated psoriasis risk associated with HT, especially in younger women. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes an association between HT and an increased risk of psoriasis in both reproductive-age and postmenopausal women using a nationwide cohort design and target trial emulation. These findings further highlight the potential influence of hormonal factors on psoriasis development. Clinicians should remain attentive to early signs of psoriasis in women receiving HT to ensure timely recognition and management.","Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Dermatology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical  Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan  University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou  Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy Practice, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.",8128051 [pii]; 10.1093/bjd/ljaf179 [doi],Yang HW; Chen YH; To SY; Wen YL; Kao S; Chen LH; Kao LT,ORCID: 0009-0003-5768-8424; ORCID: 0009-0007-5996-2879; ORCID: 0009-0005-0530-0074; ORCID: 0000-0003-0692-7408,"© The Author(s) 2025.

Psoriasis is a long-term skin condition that causes red, itchy and scaly patches. It affects about 2% of people and is linked to problems with the immune system. Some studies have suggested that hormones may affect psoriasis, but the risk for women using HT has not been clearly understood. This study was carried out in Taiwan and used health records from over 8 million women. We examined the health records from two groups of women: those of reproductive age (50 years of age or younger) and those who were postmenopausal (over 50 years of age). We then compared women who used HT with those who did not, and followed their health records for 5 years to see who developed psoriasis. Our results showed that women using HT had a higher risk of developing psoriasis. In younger women, the risk was almost twice as high, and even higher among those who used HT continuously. In postmenopausal women, the risk was also increased, although it was slightly lower than in younger women. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that hormones may play a role in psoriasis. Women using HT should be aware of this possible side-effect.

39745669,"BACKGROUND: Noncompressible truncal hemorrhage is a major contributor to  preventable deaths in trauma patients and, despite advances in emergency care, still poses a big challenge. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of trauma resuscitation care incorporating Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) compared to standard care for managing uncontrolled torso or lower body hemorrhage. METHODS: This study utilized a target trial design with a matched case-control methodology, emulating randomized 1 : 1 allocation for patients receiving trauma resuscitation care with or without the use of REBOA. The study was conducted at a high-volume trauma center in Southern Austria, including trauma patients treated between January 2019 and October 2023, aged 16 and above, with suspected severe non-compressible torso hemorrhage. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality rates at 3, 6, 24 h, and 90 days, need for damage control procedures, time to these procedures, computed tomography (CT) scan rates during resuscitation, complications, length of intensive care and in-hospital stay, and causes of death. RESULTS: Median age was 55 [interquartile range (IQR) 42-64] years. Median total injury severity, assessed by Injury Severity Score, was 46.5 (IQR: 43-57). There was no significant difference in 30-day in-hospital mortality between groups [9/22 (41%) vs. 9/22 (41%), odds ratio: 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3-3.36, P  > 0.999]. Lower mortality rates within 3, 6, and 24 h were observed in the REBOA group; in a Cox proportional hazards model, hazard ratio (95% CI) for mortality in the REBOA group was 0.87 (0.35-2.15). Timing to damage control procedures did not significantly differ between groups, although patients in the REBOA group underwent significantly more CT scans. Bleeding was cited as the main cause of death less frequently in the REBOA group. CONCLUSION: In severely injured patients presenting with possible major non-compressible torso hemorrhage, a systematically implemented resuscitation strategy including REBOA during the initial hospital phase, is not associated with significant changes in mortality.","Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine.; Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine.; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, Medical University Graz, Graz.; Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine.; Centre for Medical Data Science, Institute of Medical Statistics, Medical  University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, Medical University Graz, Graz.; Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine.; Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine.",00063110-990000000-00152 [pii]; 10.1097/MEJ.0000000000001183 [doi],Hallmann B; Honnef G; Eibinger N; Eichlseder M; Posch M; Puchwein P; Zoidl P; Zajic P,,"Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40369328,"BACKGROUND: Anecdotal evidence suggests that early renal replacement therapy  (RRT) may improve the mortality associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with leptospirosis. Conversely, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in intensive care units have refuted the positive impact of early RRT on mortality in patients with AKI and other causes of sepsis. METHODS: In this emulated RCT utilizing a propensity score-weighted logistic regression performed in the two academic centers on the island of La Réunion, France, between 2010 and 2020, we evaluated the impact of the timing of RRT on a composite outcome of mortality or new-onset or worsening chronic kidney disease (CKD) within a year, in patients hospitalized with leptospirosis, Stage 3 AKI, and no immediate need for RRT. RESULTS: We included 295 consecutive patients with leptospirosis and Stage 3 AKI: 82 (28%) began RRT within 48 h of admission (""early"" group), 213 (72%) did not start RRT within 48 h (""delayed"" group). In the delayed group, 53/213 (25%) patients eventually required RRT. 59/295 patients (20%) met the primary outcome: 32 (15%) in the delayed group and 27 (33%) in the early group. The odds ratio (OR) for primary outcome occurrence before weighing was 2.78 (95% confidence interval CI 1.53 to 5.01, p < 0.001; reference: delayed group) and after weighting was 2.08 (95% CI: 1.01 to 4.26, p = 0.046). In secondary analyses, there was a significantly higher probability of CKD occurrence in the early group (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.25 to 6.0, p = 0.012). Mortality at 1 year did not differ between groups (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.68, p = 0.666). CONCLUSION: Early initiation of RRT may be associated with an increased risk of death and development of CKD within 1 year in patients with leptospirosis and Stage 3 AKI.","Nephrology Unit, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Felix Guyon, Saint-Denis, La  Réunion, France.; Renal Intensive Care Unit, Tenon Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris,  Paris, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, Félix-Guyon University Hospital of La Réunion,  CS11021, Saint Denis, La Réunion, France.; Unité Mixte de Recherche Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical (UMR  PIMIT), Université de La Réunion, CNRS 9192, INSERM 1187, IRD 249, Saint-Denis, La Réunion, France.; Nephrology Unit, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Felix Guyon, Saint-Denis, La  Réunion, France.; Intensive Care Unit, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Saint-Denis, La Réunion,  France.; Intensive Care Unit, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Saint-Denis, La Réunion,  France.; Intensive Care Unit, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Saint-Denis, La Réunion,  France.; Renal Intensive Care Unit, Tenon Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris,  Paris, France. yannis.lombardi@aphp.fr.; Institut des Sciences du Calcul et des Données (ISCD), Sorbonne University,  Paris, France. yannis.lombardi@aphp.fr.; Sentinelles Network, Pierre Louis Institute for Epidemiology and Public Health,  INSERM and Sorbonne University, 27, Rue Chaligny, BC 2908, 75571, Paris, Cedex 12, France. yannis.lombardi@aphp.fr.",10.1186/s13613-025-01477-5 [pii]; 1477 [pii]; 10.1186/s13613-025-01477-5 [doi],Julien M; Rafat C; Raffray L; Vacher-Coponat H; Allou N; Allyn J; Jabot J; Lombardi Y,ORCID: 0000-0001-9031-1862,© 2025.

40229227,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of  prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) on the incidence of serious infections in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). METHODS: This multicenter cohort study was designed to emulate a target trial that studied 296 patients with AAV who were treated with rituximab (RTX) or cyclophosphamide (CYC) as induction therapy. Patients were grouped based on the administration of TMP-SMX within 14 days following induction therapy (n = 240 and 56 patients in prophylaxis and control groups, respectively) (intention-to-treat) and also as a time-dependent exposure (time-varying). Inverse probability weighting was applied to minimize the baseline imbalance between the two groups. The primary outcome was one-year incidence of serious infection. RESULTS: During the 252.1 person-years of observation, 77 cases of serious infections were recorded in 65 patients with a fatality rate of 18.5%. Most serious infections (n = 66, 85.7%) occurred within the first 180 days of observation. The prophylaxis group showed a significantly lower incidence of serious infections than the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.72]). However, this beneficial effect of TMP-SMX was only significant during the first 180 days (HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.22-0.76]) and not thereafter (HR 3.67 [95% CI 0.46-29.43]) (interaction P = 0.044). This result was also consistent with the time-varying analysis result. Based on one case of severe adverse drug reaction related to TMP-SMX, the number needed to harm was 127.4, whereas the number needed to treat to prevent one serious infection was 8.0. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic TMP-SMX significantly reduced the risk of serious infections in patients with AAV, particularly during the first six months of induction therapy with RTX or CYC.","Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National  University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Division of Clinical Immunology & Rheumatology, University of Alabama at  Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National  University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam-si, Republic of Korea.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil  Medical Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul Metropolitan  Government Seoul National University, Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National  University College of Medicine, Seoul, and Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam-si, Republic of Korea.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National  University College of Medicine, and Department of Molecular Medicine and Biopharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National  University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.",10.1002/art.43185 [doi],Kim YK; Curtis JR; Choi SR; Yeo J; Kim MJ; Lee YJ; Lee EB; Park JW,ORCID: 0000-0002-8907-8976; ORCID: 0000-0001-7615-8611; ORCID: 0000-0003-0703-1208; ORCID: 0000-0002-8624-2582,© 2025 The Author(s).

38319989,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy persists alongside concerns about the safety of  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. We aimed to examine the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on risk of death among US veterans. METHODS: We conducted a target trial emulation to estimate and compare risk of death up to 60 days under two COVID-19 vaccination strategies: vaccination within 7 days of enrollment versus no vaccination through follow-up. The study cohort included individuals aged ≥18 years enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration system and eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccination according to guideline recommendations from 1 March 2021 through 1 July 2021. The outcomes of interest included deaths from any cause and excluding a COVID-19 diagnosis. Observations were cloned to both treatment strategies, censored, and weighted to estimate per-protocol effects. RESULTS: We included 3 158 507 veterans. Under the vaccination strategy, 364 993 received vaccine within 7 days. At 60 days, there were 156 deaths per 100 000 veterans under the vaccination strategy versus 185 deaths under the no vaccination strategy, corresponding to an absolute risk difference of -25.9 (95% confidence limit [CL], -59.5 to 2.7) and relative risk of 0.86 (95% CL, .7 to 1.0). When those with a COVID-19 infection in the first 60 days were censored, the absolute risk difference was -20.6 (95% CL, -53.4 to 16.0) with a relative risk of 0.88 (95% CL, .7 to 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against COVID-19 was associated with a lower but not statistically significantly different risk of death in the first 60 days. These results agree with prior scientific knowledge suggesting vaccination is safe with the potential for substantial health benefits.","Center of Innovation Long-Term Services and Supports, Veterans Administration  Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Department of Health Services, Policy and Practice, School of Public Health,  Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; VA Center for Medication Safety, Department of Veterans Affairs, Chicago,  Illinois, USA.; CAUSALab, Harvard T.

40024480,"OBJECTIVES: The exclusion of pregnant women and infants from many randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) has left critical gaps in medication safety, complicating clinical decision-making during these sensitive life stages. This commentary explores target trial emulation using real-world data as a robust alternative for advancing medication safety research when RCTs are not feasible. METHODS: Target trial emulation replicates the design principles of RCTs within observational data, accounting for the dynamic nature of medication exposure across gestational stages and adjusting for time-varying confounders. While challenges such as unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and violations of positivity assumptions remain, this method provides crucial insights to address current evidence gaps. RESULTS: Information on medication exposure effects will be obtained, which will inform safer medication guidelines in pregnancy and infancy. Future research integrating artificial intelligence-driven tools, open science practices, and robust data governance frameworks will further strengthen the reliability and impact of target trial emulation. Multinational collaboration and data sharing across diverse sources will accelerate the generation of evidence, ultimately advancing medication safety. CONCLUSION: Target trial emulation, leveraging real-world data, is a promising alternative when traditional clinical trials are not feasible. This approach promotes safer medication use and improves health outcomes for mothers and infants. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Many clinical trials exclude pregnant women and infants, leaving critical gaps in understanding medication safety during pregnancy and early life. Target trial emulation, which applies clinical trial principles to real-world data, offers a promising alternative when traditional trials are not feasible. This method allows researchers to study how medications affect pregnant women and babies at different stages of pregnancy while also considering factors that change over time. While there are still challenges, like unmeasured factors and bias remain, target trial emulation helps fill these knowledge gaps. Future advancements, including AI, Open Science, enhanced data sharing, and international collaboration, can further enhance this method's ability to improve the safety of medications for mothers and infants worldwide.","Murdoch Children's Research Institute, The Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville,  Victoria, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.

38006324,"BACKGROUND: The effect of adjuvant therapy in node-negative pancreatic cancer is  uncertain. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival after surgery for pancreatic cancer in patients with node-negative (pN0) and node-positive (pN+) disease using target trial emulation. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study emulating a hypothetical RCT by the clone-censor-weight approach using population-based Danish healthcare registries. The study included Danish patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for pancreatic cancer during 2008-2021, who were discharged alive no more than 4 weeks after surgery. At the time of discharge after surgery, the data for each patient were duplicated; one copy was assigned to the adjuvant chemotherapy strategy and the other to the no adjuvant chemotherapy strategy of the hypothetical trial. Copies were censored when the assigned treatment was no longer compatible with the observed treatment. To account for informative censoring, uncensored patients were weighted according to measured confounders. The primary outcomes were absolute difference in 2-year survival and median overall survival, comparing adjuvant with no adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Some 424 patients with pN0 and 953 with pN+ disease were included. Of these, 62.0 and 74.6% respectively initiated adjuvant chemotherapy within the 8-week grace period. Among patients with pN0 tumours, the difference in 2-year survival between those with and without adjuvant therapy was -2.2 (95% c.i. -11.8 to 7.4)%. In those with pN+ disease, the difference in 2-year survival was 9.9 (1.6 to 18.1)%. Median overall survival was 24.9 (i.q.r. 12.8-49.4) and 15.0 (8.0-34.0) months for patients having adjuvant and no adjuvant therapy respectively. CONCLUSION: In a target trial emulation using observational data, adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve survival after surgery for node-negative pancreatic cancer.","Department of Surgery, Hepatopancreatobiliary Section, Aarhus University  Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Oncology and Clinical Cancer Research Centre, Aalborg University  Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Surgery, Hepatopancreatobiliary Section, Aarhus University  Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.",7450979 [pii]; 10.1093/bjs/znad398 [doi],Kirkegård J; Ladekarl M; Johannsen IR; Mortensen F,ORCID: 0000-0002-6994-0637; ORCID: 0000-0002-0182-1228,"© The Author(s) 2023.

38959183,"There is growing evidence supporting clinically important associations between  age at neutering in bitches and subsequent urinary incontinence (UI), although much of this evidence to date is considered weak. Target trial emulation is an innovative approach in causal inference that has gained substantial attention in recent years, aiming to simulate a hypothetical randomised controlled trial by leveraging observational data. Using anonymised veterinary clinical data from the VetCompass Programme, this study applied the target trial emulation framework to determine whether later-age neutering (≥ 7 to ≤ 18 months) causes decreased odds of early-onset UI (diagnosed < 8.5 years) compared to early-age neutering (3 to < 7 months). The study included bitches in the VetCompass database born from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, and neutered between 3 and 18 months old. Bitches were retrospectively confirmed from the electronic health records as neutered early or later. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of early-onset UI. Informed from a directed acyclic graph, data on the following covariates were extracted: breed, insurance status, co-morbidities and veterinary group. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for confounding, with inverse probability of censoring weighting accounting for censored bitches. The emulated trial included 612 early-age neutered bitches and 888 later-age neutered bitches. A pooled logistic regression outcome model identified bitches neutered later at 0.80 times the odds (95% CI 0.54 to 0.97) of early-onset UI compared with bitches neutered early. The findings show that later-age neutering causes reduced odds of early-onset UI diagnosis compared with early-age neutering. Decision-making on the age of neutering should be carefully considered, with preference given to delaying neutering until after 7 months of age unless other major reasons justify earlier surgery. The study is one of the first to demonstrate successful application of the target trial framework to veterinary observational data.","Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead  Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Herts, United Kingdom.; Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, United  Kingdom.; Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead  Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Herts, United Kingdom.; Research Support Office, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Herts, United  Kingdom.; School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham,  Sutton Bonington, United Kingdom.; Clinical Science and Services, The Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Lane,  North Mymms, Hatfield, Herts, United Kingdom.; Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead  Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Herts, United Kingdom.",PONE-D-24-08378 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pone.0305526 [doi],Pegram C; Diaz-Ordaz K; Brodbelt DC; Chang YM; Hall JL; Church DB; O'Neill DG,ORCID: 0000-0002-8367-5294,"Copyright: © 2024 Pegram et al.

38663126,"Bipolar disorder is associated with increased rates of many physical disorders,  but the effects of medication are unclear. We systematically investigated the associations between sustained use of first line maintenance agents, lithium versus lamotrigine and valproate, and the risk of physical disorders using a nation-wide population-based target trial emulation covering the entire 5.9 million inhabitants in Denmark. We identified two cohorts. Cohort 1: patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder prior to first purchase (N = 12.607). Cohort 2: all 156.678 adult patients who had their first ever purchase (since 1995) of either lithium, lamotrigine or valproate between 1997 and 2021 regardless of diagnosis. Main analyses investigated the effect of sustained exposure defined as exposure for all consecutive 6-months periods during a 10-year follow-up. Outcomes included a diagnosis of incident stroke, arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, myxedema, osteoporosis, dementia, Parkinson's disease, chronic kidney disease and cancer (including subtypes). In both Cohorts 1 and 2, there were no systematic statistically significant differences in associations between sustained use of lithium versus lamotrigine and valproate, respectively, and any physical disorder, including subtypes of disorders, except myxedema, for which exposure to lithium increased the absolute risk of myxedema with 7-10 % compared with lamotrigine or valproate. In conclusion, these analyses emulating a target trial of ""real world"" observational register-based data show that lithium does not increase the risk of developing any kind of physical disorders, except myxedema, which may be a result of detection bias.","Copenhagen Affective disorder Research Center (CADIC), Psychiatric Center  Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

40106109,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the impact of time to adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) on  survival after surgical resection (<8 weeks or 8-16 weeks) for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by applying a target-trial emulation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used Swedish population-based healthcare registries to emulate a hypothetical target trial, with treatment arms of 'initiate AC <8 weeks postoperatively' and 'initiate AC 8-16 weeks postoperatively'. The clone-censor-weight approach was used in which all patients were cloned and all clones were assigned to each treatment arm. Clones were then censored when the assigned treatment was no longer compatible with the actual treatment. RESULTS: We included 510 patients in the hypothetical target trial, of whom 51% received AC and 150 (57%) started AC within 8 weeks. More than half of the patients were female (52.5%) and the mean age was 69 years. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in the emulated trial for the group who initiated AC <8 weeks postoperatively was 50.3% and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 58.1%. For the group who initiated AC 8-16 weeks postoperatively, the emulated trial showed a 5-year DFS and OS of 49.1% and 57.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: By using target trial emulation, our study supports earlier data on timing for AC after surgical resection for NSCLC.

38343103,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for causal  inference. With a sufficient sample size, randomization removes confounding up to the time of randomization and allows the treatment effect to be isolated. However, RCTs may have limited generalizability and transportability and are often not feasible in addiction research due to ethical or logistical constraints. The importance of observational studies from real-world settings has been increasingly recognized in research on health. This paper provides an overview of modern approaches to designing observational studies that enable causal inference. It illustrates three key techniques, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion and Target Trial Emulation, and discusses the strengths and limitations of their applications.","National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, The University of Queensland,  Brisbane, Australia.; National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, The University of Queensland,  Brisbane, Australia.; National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, The University of Queensland,  Brisbane, Australia.; National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, The University of Queensland,  Brisbane, Australia.; National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, The University of Queensland,  Brisbane, Australia.; Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Science, The University of  Queensland, Woolloongabba, Australia.; National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, The University of Queensland,  Brisbane, Australia.; Discipline of Psychiatry, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.; National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, The University of Queensland,  Brisbane, Australia.",10.1111/add.16442 [doi],Chan GCK; Sun T; Stjepanović D; Vu G; Hall WD; Connor JP; Leung J,ORCID: 0000-0002-7569-1948; ORCID: 0000-0002-3939-9499; ORCID: 0000-0003-4307-423X; ORCID: 0000-0003-1984-0096; ORCID: 0000-0002-7020-1196; ORCID: 0000-0001-5816-2959,© 2024 The Authors.

39252433,"PURPOSE: This retrospective real-world study compared overall survival (OS)  between patients with BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) who received niraparib second-line maintenance (2LM) versus active surveillance (AS) using target trial emulation, cloning, inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) methodology to minimize immortal time bias. METHODS: Eligible patients from a United States-based, deidentified, electronic health record-derived database were diagnosed with epithelial OC (January 1, 2011-May 31, 2021), were BRCAwt, and completed second-line (2L) therapy (January 1, 2017-March 2, 2022). Patient data were cloned at index (2L last treatment date), assigned to niraparib 2LM and AS cohorts, and censored when treatment deviated from clone assignment. Follow-up was measured from index to earliest of study end (May 31, 2022), last activity, or death. Median OS (mOS) and hazard ratios were estimated from stabilized IPCW Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 199 patients received niraparib 2LM, and 707 had their care managed with AS. Key characteristics were balanced across cohorts after cloning and stabilized IPCW. Median follow-up was 15.6- and 9.3-months pre-cloning. IPCW mOS was 24.1 months (95% CI: 20.9-29.5) and 18.4 months (95% CI: 15.1-22.8) in niraparib 2LM and AS cohorts, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI: 0.66-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study provides supportive evidence of an OS benefit for patients with BRCAwt recurrent OC who received 2LM niraparib monotherapy compared with those whose care was managed with AS. The analytic strategies implemented were useful in minimizing immortal time bias and measured confounding.","GSK, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.; GSK, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; GSK, Upper Providence, Pennsylvania, USA.; GSK, Durham, North Carolina, USA.",10.1002/pds.70001 [doi],Perhanidis JA; Kalilani L; Zimmerman NM; Golembesky A,,© 2024 The Author(s).

39353713,"BACKGROUND: An association between driving pressure (∆P) and the outcomes of  invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) may exist. However, the effect of a sustained limitation of ∆P on mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including patients with COVID-19 (COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS)) undergoing IMV, has not been rigorously evaluated. The use of emulations of a target trial in intensive care unit research remains in its infancy. To inform future, large ARDS target trials, we explored using a target trial emulation approach to analyse data from a cohort of IMV adults with C-ARDS to determine whether maintaining daily ∆p<15 cm H(2)O (in addition to traditional low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) (tidal volume 5-7 cc/PBW+plateau pressure (P(plat)) ≤30 cm H(2)O), compared with LTVV alone, affects the 28-day mortality. METHODS: To emulate a target trial, adults with C-ARDS requiring >24 hours of IMV were considered to be assigned to limited ∆P or LTVV. Lung mechanics were measured twice daily after ventilator setting adjustments were made. To evaluate the effect of each lung-protective ventilation (LPV) strategy on the 28-day mortality, we fit a stabilised inverse probability weighted marginal structural model that adjusted for baseline and time-varying confounders known to affect protection strategy use/adherence or survival. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients included, 27 (29.3%) followed limited ∆P ventilation, 23 (25.0%) the LTVV strategy and 42 (45.7%) received no LPV strategy. The adjusted estimated 28-day survival was 47.0% (95% CI 23%, 76%) in the limited ∆P group, 70.3% in the LTVV group (95% CI 37.6%, 100%) and 37.6% (95% CI 20.8%, 58.0%) in the no LPV strategy group. INTERPRETATION: Limiting ∆P may not provide additional survival benefits for patients with C-ARDS over LTVV. Our results help inform the development of future target trial emulations focused on evaluating LPV strategies, including reduced ∆P, in adults with ARDS.","Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Long Beach, California, USA mtanios@uci.edu.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California  Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.; Northeastern University - Boston Campus, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California, USA.; Pharmacy and Health Systems Sciences, Northeastern University - Boston Campus,  Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Long Beach, California, USA.; Sound Physicians, Tacoma, Washington, USA.; Pharmacy and Health Systems Sciences, Northeastern University - Boston Campus,  Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston,  Massachusetts, USA.",11/1/e002439 [pii]; bmjresp-2024-002439 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjresp-2024-002439 [doi],Tanios M; Wu TT; Nguyen HM; Smith L; Mahidhara R; Devlin JW,ORCID: 0000-0002-4103-6099,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

35935819,"Background: Pregnant and postpartum women have been historically excluded from  clinical trials, with data on the safety of drugs relying on observational research. Methodological concerns regarding the timing and dosing of medications, data sources, study designs, and methods used for estimating associations are still problematic in observational studies. Answering causal questions is even more complex. Despite the increased interest in emulating target trials using observational data, little is known about this approach in perinatal pharmacoepidemiology. Objective: This scoping review protocol aims to describe the methodology for assessing the available literature concerning emulating target trials for studying outcomes in women exposed to medications in the preconception, perinatal, or postpartum periods. Methods and Analysis: We will follow the methods detailed in the Joanna Briggs Institute reviewer's manual. We will adopt the six-stage framework recommended by Arksey and O'Malley and Levac and others. Web scraping techniques will be used for identifying relevant studies. Two authors will select articles based on the title and abstract, with discrepancies resolved by consensus, by a third reviewer. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews flow diagram will be presented to reflect the search process. We will use existing statements to identify quality gaps in the current literature. Variables related to the content for perinatal pharmacoepidemiologic research will be included. The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) will guide the assessment of the target trial emulation (i.e., treatment strategies compared, assignment procedures, follow-up period, outcome, and causal contrasts). Discussion: Data regarding the safety of drugs taken, prior to and during pregnancy and while lactating are lacking and it is necessary to understand how we can answer these questions using rigorous methods in observational research. Through this scoping review, we intend to understand to what extent the target trial approach is being used in perinatal pharmacoepidemiology and provide recommendations to improve its use in this field. Ethics and Dissemination: Secondary data from published scientific articles will be used, not requiring approval by the Research Ethics Committee with human beings. Findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.","Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Epidemiology,  Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON,  Canada.; Division of Epidemiology, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of  Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), Brasília, Brazil.; Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), Brasília, Brazil.; Schulich Library of Physical Sciences, Life Sciences and Engineering, McGill  University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Epidemiology,  Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.",904824 [pii]; 10.3389/fphar.2022.904824 [doi],Leal LF; Grandi SM; Mota DM; Ferreira PJG; Gore G; Platt RW,,"Copyright © 2022 Leal, Grandi, Mota, Ferreira, Gore and Platt.",,,The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any  commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.,,2022/08/08 03:39,,20220722,2022,2022/08/09 06:00,,,"Leal, Lisiane Freitas; Grandi, Sonia Marzia; Mota, Daniel Marques; Ferreira, Paulo José Gonçalves; Gore, Genevieve; Platt, Robert William",,,,,1663-9812,1663-9812,1663-9812,101548923,Frontiers in pharmacology,eng,10.3389/fphar.2022.904824 [doi]; 904824,20250220,,2022/08/09 06:01,,,,perinatal; pharmacoepidemiogy; postpartum; preconception; scoping review; target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,904824,2022/06/14 00:00,2022/08/08 03:39,2022/08/09 06:01,,2022/07/22 00:00,2022/08/09 06:00,2022/03/25 00:00,Switzerland,PMC9354606,2022/07/22,epublish,Journal Article,,,,Front Pharmacol. 2022 Jul 22;13:904824. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2022.904824.  eCollection 2022.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Front Pharmacol,The Use of the Target Trial Approach in Perinatal Pharmacoepidemiology: A Scoping  Review Protocol.,,,,13
40372581,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of Xuanshen Yishen Decoction (XYD) in  the treatment of hypertension. METHODS: Hospital electronic medical records from 2019-2023 were utilized to emulate a randomized pragmatic clinical trial. Hypertensive participants were eligible if they were aged ⩾40 years with baseline systolic blood pressure (BP) ⩾140 mm Hg. Patients treated with XYD plus antihypertensive regimen were assigned to the treatment group, whereas those who followed only antihypertensive regimen were assigned to the control group. The primary outcome assessed was the attainment rate of intensive BP control at discharge, with the secondary outcome focusing on the 6-month all-cause readmission rate. RESULTS: The study included 3,302 patients, comprising 2,943 individuals in the control group and 359 in the treatment group. Compared with the control group, a higher proportion in the treatment group achieved the target BP for intensive BP control [8.09% vs. 17.5%; odds ratio (OR)=2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.68 to 3.13; P<0.001], particularly in individuals with high homocysteine levels (OR=3.13; 95% CI=1.72 to 5.71; P<0.001; P for interaction=0.041). Furthermore, the 6-month all-cause readmission rate in the treatment group was lower than in the control group (hazard ratio=0.58; 95% CI=0.36 to 0.91; P=0.019), and the robustness of the results was confirmed by sensitivity analyse. CONCLUSIONS: XYD could be a complementary therapy for intensive BP control. Our study offers real-world evidence and guides the choice of complementary and alternative therapies.

40690440,"BACKGROUND: The effects of mode of birth for women in preterm breech labour could  not be successfully determined in randomised trials. We aimed to explore the effect of caesarean birth on perinatal mortality for women in spontaneous-onset preterm labour with a singleton baby presenting breech through target trial emulation. METHODS: A target trial emulation of a parallel group randomised controlled trial using routinely collected Scottish electronic health record data was performed. Participants were pregnant women at 24-36 gestational weeks with a singleton breech baby, no prior caesarean birth, in spontaneous labour with a live baby at labour onset (1 January 1997 to 31 December 2019). We compared caesarean birth (intervention) to vaginal breech birth (control) in a per-protocol analysis (actual mode of birth). The primary outcome was extended perinatal mortality (intrapartum stillbirths and neonatal deaths). A multiple logistic regression model with inverse probability weight was used to adjust for measured confounders. There were 2,092 caesarean births and 967 vaginal breech births. In the emulated trial, caesarean birth reduced extended perinatal mortality compared to vaginal breech birth (odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.43). At 24 weeks' gestation, caesarean birth decreased the odds of perinatal death by 47.7% (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.78). At 36 gestational weeks it was associated with an 82.1% reduction in the odds of perinatal death (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.32). As the risk of perinatal mortality is inversely correlated with gestational age at birth, seven and 88 caesarean births were needed to prevent one perinatal death at 24 weeks and 36 weeks' gestation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Caesarean birth was associated with a reduced risk of extended perinatal mortality in spontaneous preterm singleton breech labour in a per-protocol trial emulation. Observational data that accurately captures planned mode of birth and unmeasured confounders such as breech subtype is required to emulate an intention-to-treat analysis.","Research Fellow in Medical Statistics, Division of Population and Behavioural  Sciences, School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom.; Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy, United  Kingdom.; Senior Lecturer, School of Medicine, St Andrews University, St Andrews, United  Kingdom.; Honorary Lecturer, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, United  Kingdom.; Honorary Senior Lecturer, Division of Population and Behavioural Sciences, School  of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom.; General Practitioner, Los Pintores Primary Health Center (SERMAS), Madrid, Spain.; Health Research Institute-Fundación Jiménez Díaz University Hospital, Universidad  Autónoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain.; Associate Professor in Medical Statistics, Centre for Healthcare and Community,  Coventry University, Coventry, United Kingdom.; Resident Doctor, Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, Stockport, United Kingdom.; Resident Physician, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of  Toronto, Toronto, Canada.; Honorary Professor in Maternal and Fetal Health, Usher Institute, Centre for  Medical Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Honorary Professor in Maternal and Fetal Health, Usher Institute, Centre for  Medical Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Honorary Senior Clinical Lecturer, Department of Child Life and Health,  University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Paediatric Respiratory Consultant, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal  Hospital for Children and Young People, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Lecturer in Statistics, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St  Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom.; Professor in Health Data Science, Division of Population and Behavioural  Sciences, School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom.; Associate Professor, Menzies School of Health Research, Charles Darwin  University, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.; Honorary Senior Clinical Lecturer, Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool  School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, United Kingdom.; Honorary Senior Research Fellow, Department of Infectious Diseases, Doherty  Institute, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Department of Obstetrics and  Gynaecology, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Australia.",PONE-D-25-27259 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pone.0326001 [doi],Alexander R; Bhaskar S; Azcoaga-Lorenzo A; Fagbamigbe AF; Chow CYC; Kuan KKW; Stock SJ; Unger SA; Swallow B; McCowan C; Unger HW,ORCID: 0000-0002-5586-5752; ORCID: 0000-0001-6347-536X,"Copyright: © 2025 Alexander et al.

33606891,"AIM: To assess the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) occurrence associated  with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor use relative to biguanide use in diabetes in a population-based cohort study using a target trial emulation framework. METHODS: Using a Japanese nationwide administrative claims database, we constructed a cohort of patients aged ≥40 years who were dispensed SGLT2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or biguanides between April 2014 and March 2015. For computational ease, we randomly sampled 100% of SGLT2 inhibitor users, 3% of DPP-4 inhibitor users, and 20% of biguanide users; new antidiabetic drug initiators were analysed. We estimated the intention-to-treat (ITT) hazard ratios (HRs) of UTI with inverse probability of treatment (IPT)-weighted Cox's proportional hazards models that ignored subsequent treatment changes. Treatment weights were computed using patient sex, age, medications, medical history and hospitalization history. We also estimated per-protocol (PP) HRs using IPT- and inverse probability of censoring-weighted Cox's models that adjusted for nonrandom treatment changes. RESULTS: We analysed 11 364 SGLT2 inhibitor initiators, 9035 DPP-4 inhibitor initiators, and 10 359 biguanide initiators. When compared with biguanide initiators, SGLT2 inhibitor initiators had a crude HR of 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.24), an ITT HR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.86-1.03), and a PP HR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.78-1.03); and DPP-4 inhibitor initiators had a crude HR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23), an ITT HR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.77-0.94), and a PP HR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.71-0.95). CONCLUSION: Use of SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors did not increase the risk of UTI compared with biguanide use. Accounting for treatment changes did not substantially influence the estimated effects.","Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Graduate School of  Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Healthcare Quality Assessment, Graduate School of Medicine,  University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Graduate School of  Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology & Health Economics, School of Public Health,  Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology & Health Economics, School of Public Health,  Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Healthcare Quality Assessment, Graduate School of Medicine,  University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Graduate School of  Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",10.1111/dom.14353 [doi],Takeuchi Y; Kumamaru H; Hagiwara Y; Matsui H; Yasunaga H; Miyata H; Matsuyama Y,ORCID: 0000-0001-9821-0513; ORCID: 0000-0002-9759-6191,© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,,,,,2021/02/19 17:13,20210709,20210308,2021 Jun,2021/02/20 06:00,,,"Takeuchi, Yoshinori; Kumamaru, Hiraku; Hagiwara, Yasuhiro; Matsui, Hiroki; Yasunaga, Hideo; Miyata, Hiroaki; Matsuyama, Yutaka",,"This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture,  Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (17H04141 and 17H05077) and grants from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan (H29-ICT-General-004)./",6,,1463-1326,1462-8902,,100883645,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",eng,10.1111/dom.14353 [doi],20210709,"Cohort Studies; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology; *Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/adverse effects; Glucose; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects; Japan/epidemiology; Retrospective Studies; Sodium; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/adverse effects; *Urinary Tract Infections/epidemiology",2021/07/10 06:00,,,,antidiabetics; causal inference; cohort study; observational study; pharmacoepidemiology; real-world data; urology,NOTNLM,NLM,1379-1388,2021/02/15 00:00,2021/02/19 17:13,2021/07/10 06:00,2021/01/28 00:00 [revised],,2021/02/20 06:00,2020/11/10 00:00,England,,,ppublish,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",0 (Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors); 0 (Hypoglycemic Agents); 0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors); 9NEZ333N27 (Sodium); IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose),IM,,Diabetes Obes Metab. 2021 Jun;23(6):1379-1388. doi: 10.1111/dom.14353.

39504056,"IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are recognized as revolutionary  cancer therapies but have raised concerns about immune-related adverse events, including the development of autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psoriasis risk associated with the use of ICIs in patients with cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study with a target trial emulation design used data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database and the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The participants included were patients who received antineoplastic medications for cancer at stages III and IV between January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2021. Data were analyzed from May 2023 to July 2024. EXPOSURES: Patients treated with ICIs were classified as ICI users, while those who received chemotherapy or targeted therapies were categorized as non-ICI users. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of psoriasis during the follow-up period. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to mitigate potential confounders. Cox and Fine-Gray hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for psoriasis risk between groups. RESULTS: Of 135 230 patients who received antineoplastic medications (mean [SD] age, 62.94 [13.01] years; 45.1% female), 3188 patients were eligible for the ICI user group, while 132 042 patients were eligible for the non-ICI user group. ICI users experienced a higher incidence of psoriasis at 5.76 cases per 1000 person-years, compared to 1.44 cases in the non-ICI group. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, ICI users were found to have a 2-fold increase in the risk of developing psoriasis (IPTW-adjusted HR, 3.31; IPTW-adjusted subdistribution HR, 2.43). Both as-started design and on-treatment design showed consistent findings, and the results were consistent and robust across all follow-up intervals and all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, patients with cancer treated with ICIs faced an increased risk of psoriasis. Medical professionals should be aware of the potential adverse effects of immunotherapy to ensure optimal cancer care.","Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Hematology and Oncology Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine,  Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Dermatology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical  Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy Practice, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,  Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy Practice, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.",2825850 [pii]; doi240048 [pii]; 10.1001/jamadermatol.2024.4129 [doi],To SY; Lee CH; Chen YH; Hsu CL; Yang HW; Jiang YS; Wen YL; Chen IW; Kao LT,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Prof Kao reported research funding from IQVIA  outside the submitted work.

35170158,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Understanding the adverse effects of proton pump  inhibitors (PPIs) is important due to their widespread use, but the available evidence for an increased dementia risk amongst patients taking PPIs is inconclusive. The present study aimed to estimate the causal effect of PPIs on the risk of dementia by target trial emulation and time-varying exposure modeling. METHODS: Using claims data of 2,698,176 insured people of a large German statutory health insurer, a target trial was conceptualized in which individuals aged 40 years and older were classified as PPI initiators or non-initiators between 2008 and 2018, and were followed until diagnosis of dementia, death, loss to follow-up or end of study. Incidence of dementia (International Classification of Diseases 10 codes F00, F01, F03, F05.1, G30, G31.0, G31.1, G31.9 and F02.8+G31.82) was defined applying a 1-year lag window. Weighted Cox models were used to estimate the effect of PPI initiation versus non-initiation on dementia risk and weighted pooled logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of time-varying use versus non-use. RESULTS: In all, 29,746 PPI initiators (4.4%) and 26,830 non-initiators (1.3%) were diagnosed with dementia. Comparing PPI initiation with no initiation, the hazard ratio for dementia was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.51-1.58). The hazard ratio for time-dependent PPI use versus non-use was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.50-1.63). Differentiated subtypes, including unspecified dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, showed increased risk by PPI initiation and time-varying PPI use. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that PPI initiation and time-varying PPI use may increase overall dementia risk.","Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE),  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.; Chair of Epidemiology, University of Augsburg at University Hospital Augsburg,  Augsburg, Germany.; Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE),  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.; Chair of Epidemiology, University of Augsburg at University Hospital Augsburg,  Augsburg, Germany.; AOK Bayern, Munich, Germany.; AOK Bayern, Munich, Germany.; Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Bavaria (Kassenärztliche  Vereinigung Bayerns, KVB), Munich, Germany.; Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Bavaria (Kassenärztliche  Vereinigung Bayerns, KVB), Munich, Germany.; Independent Research Group Clinical Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München,  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.; Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE),  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.; Chair of Epidemiology, University of Augsburg at University Hospital Augsburg,  Augsburg, Germany.; Independent Research Group Clinical Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München,  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.; Chair of Epidemiology, University of Augsburg at University Hospital Augsburg,  Augsburg, Germany.; Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE),  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.; Chair of Epidemiology, University of Augsburg at University Hospital Augsburg,  Augsburg, Germany.; Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for  Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.; Institute of Health Services Research in Dentistry, University of Münster,  Münster, Germany.",10.1111/ene.15284 [doi],Ahn N; Nolde M; Günter A; Güntner F; Gerlach R; Tauscher M; Amann U; Linseisen J; Meisinger C; Rückert-Eheberg IM; Baumeister SE,ORCID: 0000-0003-4414-114X; ORCID: 0000-0001-6893-7367,© 2022 The Authors.

37914923,"BACKGROUND: We examined the impact of early (0-4 weeks after discharge) versus  late (> 4-8 weeks after discharge) initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy on pancreatic adenocarcinoma survival. METHODS: We used Danish population-based healthcare registries to emulate a hypothetical target trial using the clone-censor-weight approach. All eligible patients were cloned with one clone assigned to 'early initiation' and one clone assigned to 'late initiation'. Clones were censored when the assigned treatment was no longer compatible with the actual treatment. Informative censoring was addressed using inverse probability of censoring weighting. RESULTS: We included 1491 patients in a hypothetical target trial, of whom 32.3% initiated chemotherapy within 0-4 weeks and 38.3% between > 4 and 8 weeks after discharge for pancreatic adenocarcinoma surgery; 206 (13.8%) initiated chemotherapy after > 8 weeks, and 232 (15.6%) did not initiate chemotherapy. Median overall survival was 30.4 and 29.9 months in late and early initiators, respectively. The absolute differences in OS, comparing late with early initiators, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] - 1.5%, 7.9%), - 0.7% (95% CI - 7.2%, 5.8%), and 3.2% (95% CI - 2.8%, 9.3%) at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Late initiators had a higher increase in albumin levels as well as higher pretreatment albumin values. CONCLUSIONS: Postponement of adjuvant chemotherapy up to 8 weeks after discharge from pancreatic adenocarcinoma surgery is safe and may allow more patients to receive adjuvant therapy due to better recovery.","HPB Section, Department of Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.  kirkegaard@clin.au.dk.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.  kirkegaard@clin.au.dk.; Department of Oncology and Clinical Cancer Research Center, Aalborg University  Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; HPB Section, Department of Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; HPB Section, Department of Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.",10.1245/s10434-023-14497-x [pii]; 14497 [pii]; 10.1245/s10434-023-14497-x [doi],Kirkegård J; Ladekarl M; Lund A; Mortensen F,ORCID: 0000-0002-6994-0637; ORCID: 0000-0002-0182-1228; ORCID: 0000-0002-7016-097X,© 2023.

39847346,"IMPORTANCE: The increasing use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists  (GLP-1RA) demands a better understanding of their association with thyroid cancer. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of incident thyroid cancer among adults with type 2 diabetes being treated with GLP-1RA vs other common glucose-lowering medications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prespecified secondary analysis of a target trial emulation of a comparative effectiveness study using claims data for enrollees in commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare fee-for-service plans across the US. Eligible participants were adults with type 2 diabetes at moderate risk for cardiovascular disease and without history of thyroid cancer who had newly filled prescriptions for GLP-1RA, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i), or sulfonylurea from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed February 1 to October 31, 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall and piecewise (<1, 1-2, and ≥2 years since treatment initiation) hazard ratios (HRs) for thyroid cancer with use of GLP-1RA vs the other 3 drug classes were estimated using inverse propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Modified intention-to-treat (mITT) (primary) and as-treated (sensitivity) analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 351 913 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [8.5] years; 173 391 [49.3%] females and 178 522 [50.7%] males), 41 112 started treatment with GLP-1RA; 76 093, with DPP4i; 43 499, with SGLT2i; and 191 209, with sulfonylurea therapy. The numbers of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer were 69 (0.17%) in the GLP-1RA group, 172 (0.23%) in the DPP4i group, 72 (0.17%) in the SGLT2i group, and 381 (0.20%) in the sulfonylurea group. In the mITT analysis, GLP-1RA initiation was not significantly associated with increased overall risk for thyroid cancer compared to the other 3 diabetes drugs (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.88-1.76). However, the risk for thyroid cancer was significantly higher within the first year after GLP-1RA initiation (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11-3.08) and was amplified in the overall as-treated analysis that censored patients when therapy was discontinued or another medication was added (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.10-3.95). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This secondary analysis of a target trial emulation of a comparative effectiveness study found that despite the low absolute risk of thyroid cancer among patients receiving GLP-1RA therapy, there was an increased risk of new thyroid cancer diagnoses within the first year of GLP-1RA initiation compared to 3 other diabetes drugs. This finding may have been due to enhanced early detection; therefore, further research is necessary to understand the underlying causes of this association.","Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism, and Nutrition, Mayo Clinic,  Rochester, Minnesota.; Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes,  Metabolism, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E.

39543770,"BACKGROUND: Patients with kidney failure often lack robust evidence because they  are excluded from randomized trials. Trial emulation provides an alternative approach to derive treatment effect estimates when randomized trials cannot be conducted. Critical questions about the comparative efficacy and safety of interventions in kidney failure are now being answered using this approach or parts of it. However, variations and inconsistencies in reporting cast doubt on the reliability and validity of effect estimates not derived from randomized trials. The aim of this methodological systematic review is to understand the extent to which the target study approach is used in kidney failure and the appropriateness of this approach. By identifying and evaluating studies that qualify as emulating a target trial, compared with studies that did not apply the principles. We aim to provide more specific methodological guidance to increase the clarity and reliability of reporting treatment effect estimates when running a trial in kidney failure is not feasible. METHODS: This protocol is developed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. MEDLINE, Embase, and reference lists (backwards citation chasing) will be searched up until 1st July 2023 and the search updated prior to publication to identify all studies evaluating patient outcomes in late-stage kidney disease and failure that use target trial emulation as the primary approach for analysis. Two authors (A. A., P. K.) will select articles based on title and abstract and then full text, with a third reviewer settling disagreements (J. P.). The prespecified variables will be extracted, and the risk of bias will be assessed by at least two authors (A. A., P. K., A. N.) using prespecified data forms. This will enable the determination of the robustness of the methodological quality of observational studies in using the whole or elements of the target trial approach. We will thereby assess their ability to reliably report treatment effect estimates. DISCUSSION: We will provide specific methodological recommendations on how to design target trials and model assumptions for emulation to get reliable treatment effect estimates for therapeutic interventions in kidney failure.

38859829,"Patients who undergo primary tumor resection (PTR) reportedly have significantly  higher overall survival (OS) than those who do not undergo this procedure. However, this result is only evident in past retrospective studies, and clinical trial results did not show the same trend. Thus, it remains unclear whether primary tumor resection effectively increases survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) across different study designs. We compared the OS of patients with asymptomatic unresectable mCRC who underwent PTR with that of those who did not. This retrospective cohort study was designed to be a target trial emulation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that would have compared the effectiveness of PTR versus non-PTR in patients with asymptomatic unresectable mCRC from 2009 to 2017. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to compare the efficacy of PTR and non-PTR in patients with mCRC, and corresponding results were compared. This cohort included 1,132 patients for a per-protocol analysis. The PTR group had non-significantly longer survival (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.62-1.01) than the non-PTR group in our cohort. A meta-analysis including five RCTs (1,016 patients) and our cohort found that the PTR group did not have a significantly lower mortality rate than the non-PTR group. The results of this cohort study and previous RCTs suggest that PTR is not associated with improved survival compared to systemic chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy among asymptomatic unresectable mCRC patients. Therefore, routine PTR is not recommended in these patients.","Division of Colorectal Surgery, Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Veterans General  Hospital Kaohsiung 81362, Taiwan.; Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung  University Taipei 11221, Taiwan.; Clinical Innovation and Research Center, National Cheng Kung University Hospital,  National Cheng Kung University Tainan 70403, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Tainan 70101, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital Kaohsiung 813414,  Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University  Tainan 70101, Taiwan.; Division of Colorectal Surgery, Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Veterans General  Hospital Kaohsiung 81362, Taiwan.; Division of Colorectal Surgery, Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Veterans General  Hospital Kaohsiung 81362, Taiwan.; Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung  University Taipei 11221, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital Kaohsiung 813414,  Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University  Kaohsiung 807378, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, Chia-Nan University of Pharmacy and Science Tainan  717301, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",10.62347/UGXA9515 [doi],Wu CC; Su CC; Lee PT; Chen YH; Hsu CW; Su YC,,AJCR Copyright © 2024.,,,None.,,2024/06/11 03:54,,20240515,2024,2024/06/11 06:42,,,"Wu, Chih-Chien; Su, Chien-Chou; Lee, Pei-Ting; Chen, Yu-Hsun; Hsu, Chao-Wen; Su, Yi-Chia",,,5,,2156-6976,2156-6976,2156-6976,101549944,American journal of cancer research,eng,10.62347/UGXA9515 [doi],20240612,,2024/06/11 06:43,,,,Colorectal cancer; meta-analysis; primary tumor resection; survival; targeted therapy; trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,2172-2186,2024/04/07 00:00,2024/06/11 03:54,2024/06/11 06:43,,2024/05/15 00:00,2024/06/11 06:42,2024/02/04 00:00,United States,PMC11162688,2024/05/15,epublish,Journal Article,,,,Am J Cancer Res. 2024 May 15;14(5):2172-2186. doi: 10.62347/UGXA9515. eCollection  2024.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Am J Cancer Res,Comparative effectiveness of primary tumor resection versus chemotherapy in  patients with asymptomatic unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective cohort study using the target trial emulation framework.,,,,14
35808992,"When drawing causal inference from observed data, failure time outcomes present  additional challenges of censoring often combined with other missing data patterns. In this article, we follow incident cases of end-stage renal disease to examine the effect on all-cause mortality of starting treatment with transplant, so-called pre-emptive kidney transplantation, vs starting with dialysis possibly followed by delayed transplantation. The question is relatively simple: which start-off treatment is expected to bring the best survival for a target population? To address it, we emulate a target trial drawing on the long term Swedish Renal Registry, where a growing common set of baseline covariates was measured nationwide. Several lessons are learned which pertain to long term disease registers more generally. With characteristics of cases and versions of treatment evolving over time, informative censoring is already introduced in unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves. This leads to misrepresented survival chances in observed treatment groups. The resulting biased treatment association may be aggravated upon implementing IPW for treatment. Aware of additional challenges, we further recall how similar studies to date have selected patients into treatment groups based on events occurring post treatment initiation. Our study reveals the dramatic impact of resulting immortal time bias combined with other typical features of long-term incident disease registers, including missing covariates during the early phases of the register. We discuss feasible ways of accommodating these features when targeting relevant estimands, and demonstrate how more than one causal question can be answered relying on the no unmeasured baseline confounders assumption.","Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, Ghent  University, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Academisch  Medisch Centrum, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Statistics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Swedish Renal Registry, Jönköping County Hospital, Jönköping, Sweden.; Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, Ghent  University, Ghent, Belgium.",SIM9503 [pii]; 10.1002/sim.9503 [doi],Olarte Parra C; Waernbaum I; Schön S; Goetghebeur E,ORCID: 0000-0003-0263-4392; ORCID: 0000-0002-4457-5311; ORCID: 0000-0002-8896-0721,© 2022 The Authors.

39353689,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the association of early statin initiation with inpatient  mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational study emulated a hypothetical target trial using electronic health records data from Northwestern Medicine Health System, Illinois, 2020-2022. We included patients who were ≥40 years, admitted ≥48 hours for COVID-19 from March 2020 to August 2022 and had no evidence of statin use before admission. INTERVENTIONS: Individuals who initiated any statins within 48 hours of admission were compared with individuals who did not initiate statins during this period. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Inpatient mortality at hospital days 7, 14, 21 and 28 were determined using hospital records. Risk differences between exposure groups were calculated using augmented inverse propensity weighting (AIPW) with SuperLearner. RESULTS: A total of 8893 individuals (24.5% early statin initiators) were included. Early initiators tended to be older, male and have higher comorbidity burdens. Unadjusted day 28 mortality was higher in early initiators (6.0% vs 3.6%). Adjusted analysis showed slightly higher inpatient mortality risk at days 7 (RD: 0.5%, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.8) and 21 (RD: 0.6%, 95% CI: 0.04 to 1.1), but not days 14 (RD: 0.4%, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.9) and 28 (RD: 0.4%, 95% CI: -0.2 to 1.1). Sensitivity analyses using alternative modelling approaches showed no difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Early statin initiation was not associated with lower mortality contrasting with findings of previous observational studies. Trial emulation helped in identifying and addressing sources of bias incompletely addressed by previous work.

39720658,"BACKGROUND: Gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are opioid  substitutes commonly included in perioperative multimodal analgesia regimens. We investigated whether the initiation of gabapentin and pregabalin during the perioperative period have varying effects on the adverse renal outcomes. METHODS: This study included adult participants who received surgery in the INSPIRE database. The exposure of interest was the initiation of pregabalin or gabapentin during the perioperative period. The primary outcome was renal function decline. Secondary outcomes included incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI), and in-hospital mortality. We conducted a propensity score to balance the baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of the initiation of gabapentin compared with pregabalin. RESULTS: Among 640 pairs of pregabalin and gabapentin initiators in the matched cohort, the initiation of gabapentin was associated with a higher risk of kidney function decline (HR, 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.89) as compared with pregabalin. After excluding participants who were diagnosed with CKD at the baseline, the initiation of gabapentin was associated with a higher risk of incident CKD (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.03-2.05) as compared with pregabalin. For the in-hospital outcomes, the proportion of AKI and mortality were similar between participants initiating gabapentin and pregabalin. In addition, the risk of kidney function decline did not vary across each subgroup. CONCLUSION: The initiation of gabapentin during the perioperative period was associated with a higher risk of kidney function decline and incident CKD as compared with pregabalin.","Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University,  Guangzhou, China.; Department of Pharmacy, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou,  China.; Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University,  Guangzhou, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University,  Guangzhou, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University,  Guangzhou, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University,  Guangzhou, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University,  Guangzhou, China.; Department of Nephrology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.",10.3389/fmed.2024.1488773 [doi],He Y; Mo L; Li J; Lu D; Niu J; Li Y; Zeng Q; Gao Y,,"Copyright © 2024 He, Mo, Li, Lu, Niu, Li, Zeng and Gao.",,,The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any  commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.,,2024/12/25 04:27,,20241210,2024,2024/12/25 06:19,,,"He, Yanfang; Mo, Liqian; Li, Juan; Lu, Dongying; Niu, Jinlei; Li, Ying; Zeng, Qiying; Gao, Yueming",,,,,2296-858X,2296-858X,2296-858X,101648047,Frontiers in medicine,eng,10.3389/fmed.2024.1488773 [doi]; 1488773,20250104,,2024/12/25 06:20,,,,acute kidney injury; gabapentin; kidney function; perioperative analgesia; pregabalin,NOTNLM,NLM,1488773,2024/11/18 00:00,2024/12/25 04:27,2024/12/25 06:20,,2024/12/10 00:00,2024/12/25 06:19,2024/08/30 00:00,Switzerland,PMC11666351,2024/12/10,epublish,Journal Article,,,,Front Med (Lausanne). 2024 Dec 10;11:1488773. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2024.1488773.  eCollection 2024.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Front Med (Lausanne),Association of perioperative initiation of gabapentin versus pregabalin with  kidney function: a target trial emulation study.,,,,11
38682336,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of heart failure (HF).  Most patients do not undergo coronary assessment after HF diagnosis. There are no randomized clinical trials of coronary assessment after HF diagnosis. METHODS: Using an electronic health record cohort of all individuals with HF within the San Francisco Health Network from 2001 to 2019, we identified factors associated with coronary assessment. Then, we studied the association of coronary assessment within 30 days of HF diagnosis with all-cause mortality and a composite of mortality and emergent angiography using a target trial emulation observational comparative-effectiveness approach. Target trial emulation is an approach to causal inference based on creating a hypothetical randomized clinical trial protocol and using observational data to emulate the protocol. We used propensity scores for covariate adjustment. We used national death records to improve the ascertainment of mortality and included falsification end points for the cause of death. RESULTS: Among 14 829 individuals with HF (median, 62 years old; 5855 [40%] women), 3987 (26.9%) ever completed coronary assessment, with 2467/13 301 (18.5%) with unknown coronary artery disease status at HF diagnosis assessed. Women, older individuals, and people without stable housing were less likely to complete coronary assessment. Among 5972 eligible persons of whom 627 underwent early elective coronary assessment, coronary assessment was associated with lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.72-0.97]; P=0.025), reduced risk of the composite outcome (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.73-1.00]), higher rates of revascularization (odds ratio, 7.6 [95% CI, 5.4-10.6]), and higher use of medical therapy (odds ratio, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]), but not the falsification end points. CONCLUSIONS: In a safety-net population, disparities in coronary assessment after HF diagnosis are not fully explained by coronary artery disease risk factors. Early coronary assessment is associated with improved HF outcomes possibly related to higher rates of revascularization and guideline-directed medical therapy but with low certainty that this finding is not attributable to unmeasured confounding.","Division of Cardiology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General and Department of  Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).; Division of Cardiology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General and Department of  Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).; Division of Cardiology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General and Department of  Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).; Division of Cardiology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General and Department of  Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).; Division of Cardiology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General and Department of  Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).; Division of Cardiology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General and Department of  Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).",CIRCCQO2023010800D-A [pii]; 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.123.010800 [doi],Durstenfeld MS; Thakkar A; Ma Y; Zier LS; Davis JD; Hsue PY,ORCID: 0000-0002-7612-3352; ORCID: 0000-0003-2037-4475; ORCID: 0000-0002-3879-5529; ORCID: 0000-0003-2822-6776; ORCID: 0000-0002-3427-6043,,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2024 Jun;17(6):e010979. doi:  10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.124.010979.

40384944,"Due to dependent happenings, vaccines can have different effects in populations.  In addition to direct protective effects in the vaccinated, vaccination in a population can have indirect effects in the unvaccinated individuals. Vaccination can also reduce person-to-person transmission to vaccinated individuals or from vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated individuals. Design of vaccine studies has a history extending back over a century. Emerging infectious diseases, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, have stimulated new interest in vaccine studies. We focus on some recent developments, such as target trial emulation, test-negative design, and regression discontinuity design. Methods for evaluating durability of vaccine effects were developed in the context of both blinded and unblinded placebo crossover studies. The case-ascertained design is used to assess the transmission effects of vaccines. The novel ring vaccination trial design was first used in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.","Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle,  Washington, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.",10.1146/annurev-statistics-033121-120121 [doi],Halloran ME,,,,,,,2025/05/19 06:07,,20241030,2025 Mar,2025/05/19 12:30,,,"Halloran, M Elizabeth",,R01 AI085073/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States,,,2326-831X,2326-8298,2326-8298,101622422,Annual review of statistics and its application,eng,10.1146/annurev-statistics-033121-120121 [doi],20250521,,2025/05/19 12:31,NIHMS2059731,,,causal inference; cluster-randomized trial; immune correlates; observational study; regression discontinuity design; ring vaccination; target trial emulation; test-negative design; vaccines,NOTNLM,NLM,1-18,,2025/05/19 06:07,2025/05/19 12:31,,2025/05/16 00:00,2025/05/19 12:30,,United States,PMC12083782,2025/05/16,ppublish,Journal Article,,,,Annu Rev Stat Appl. 2025 Mar;12:1-18. doi:  10.1146/annurev-statistics-033121-120121.

38696367,"BACKGROUND: There is little long-term causal evidence on the effect of physical  activity on health-related quality of life. This study aimed to examine the associations between longitudinal patterns of physical activity over 15 years and health-related quality of life in both the physical and mental health domains, in a cohort of middle-aged Australian women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data collected at 3-year intervals (1998 to 2019) from 11,336 participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) (1946 to 1951 birth cohort). Primary outcomes were the physical (PCS) and mental health component summary (MCS) scores (range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate higher perceived physical/mental health) from the SF-36 in 2019 (when women aged 68 to 73 years). Using target trial emulation to imitate a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we tested 2 interventions: (1) meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) physical activity guidelines consistently throughout the 15-year ""exposure period"" (2001 to 2016; when women aged 50-55 to 65-70 years; physical activity assessed every 3 years); and (2) not meeting the guidelines at the beginning of the exposure period but starting to first meet the guidelines at age 55, 60, or 65; against the control of not meeting the guidelines throughout the exposure period. Analysis controlled for confounding using marginal structural models which were adjusted for sociodemographic and health variables and conditions. Consistent adherence to guidelines during the exposure period (PCS: 46.93 [99.5% confidence interval [CI]: 46.32, 47.54]) and first starting to meet the guidelines at age 55 (PCS: 46.96 [99.5% CI: 45.53, 48.40]) were associated with three-point higher PCS (mean score difference: 3.0 [99.5% CI: 1.8, 4.1] and 3.0 [99.5% CI:1.2, 4.8]) than consistent non-adherence (PCS: 43.90 [99.5% CI: 42.79, 45.01]). We found a similar pattern for most SF-36 subscales but no significant effects of the interventions on MCS. The main limitations of the study were that it may not account for all underlying health conditions and/or other unmeasured or insufficiently measured confounders, the use of self-reported physical activity and that findings may not be generalizable to all mid-age women. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the emulated RCT suggest women should be active throughout mid-age, ideally increasing activity levels to meet the guidelines by age 55, to gain the most benefits for physical health in later life.","Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of  Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.; Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.; Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of  Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.; Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia.; School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane,  Australia.; Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, Bond University, Gold Coast, Australia.; School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences, Faculty of Health and  Behavioural Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.; Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of  Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.; Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.",PMEDICINE-D-23-03319 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004384 [doi],Nguyen B; Clare P; Mielke GI; Brown WJ; Ding D,ORCID: 0000-0002-9501-4397; ORCID: 0000-0002-2009-7386; ORCID: 0000-0002-3043-2715; ORCID: 0000-0001-9093-4509; ORCID: 0000-0001-9850-9224,"Copyright: © 2024 Nguyen et al.

37353297,"The preferred approach to compare two treatments is a randomized controlled trial  (RCT). Indeed, randomization ensures that the groups compared are similar. Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs thus allow to draw causal conclusions on the relative efficacy and safety of treatments compared. However, it is not always possible to conduct RCTs for all clinical questions of interest, and observational data may also be used to infer on the relative effectiveness of treatments. In this review, we present different approaches that allow statistically valid comparisons of the effectiveness of treatments using observational data under some assumptions. Those are based on regression modelling or the propensity score. We also present the principles of target trial emulation.","Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAE, Center  for Research in Epidemiology and StatisticS (CRESS), F-75004, Paris, France.; Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAE, Center  for Research in Epidemiology and StatisticS (CRESS), F-75004, Paris, France; Centre d'Épidémiologie Clinique, AP-HP, Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, F-75004, Paris, France.

40266152,"Background: Assessing the real-world safety of preventive products against  respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in pregnant women holds significant public health implications, especially as vaccination programs become more widespread. This generic protocol describes a post-authorisation safety study (PASS) to evaluate the safety of RSV vaccination in pregnant women using a target trial emulation framework. Methods: This generic protocol, adapted from an ongoing PASS, is designed using the target trial emulation framework to evaluate the safety of an RSV vaccine in pregnant women. Emulating target trial conditions have the ability to minimise confounding and bias. In this pragmatic real-world observational study, RSV-vaccinated pregnant women are matched (1:N) with unexposed women based on gestational age, calendar time, maternal age, immunocompromised status, and high-risk pregnancy. Key adverse outcomes include preterm birth, stillbirth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA). Future studies may add additional outcomes per vaccine risk profile and Global Alignment of Immunization safety Assessment (GAIA) recommendations. Distinguishing outcomes measured during pregnancy from those assessed at or after birth is crucial for analysis and interpretation. Conclusions: This protocol offers a structured approach to evaluating the safety of RSV vaccines in pregnant women. It aims to guide researchers in designing studies and should be adapted to specific settings and data availability.","Department of Data Science & Biostatistics, Julius Global Health, University  Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Obstetrics, Division Woman and Baby, Wilhelmina Children's  Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Data Science & Biostatistics, Julius Global Health, University  Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Data Science & Biostatistics, Julius Global Health, University  Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Data Science & Biostatistics, Julius Global Health, University  Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Data Science & Biostatistics, Julius Global Health, University  Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Data Science & Biostatistics, Julius Global Health, University  Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Safety Surveillance Research Worldwide Medical and Safety, Pfizer, Inc., New  York, NY 10001-2192, USA.; Safety Surveillance Research Worldwide Medical and Safety, Pfizer, Inc., New  York, NY 10001-2192, USA.; Department of Obstetrics, Division Woman and Baby, Wilhelmina Children's  Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Safety Surveillance Research Worldwide Medical and Safety, Pfizer, Inc., New  York, NY 10001-2192, USA.; Department of Data Science & Biostatistics, Julius Global Health, University  Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), 3584CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.",vaccines13030272 [pii]; vaccines-13-00272 [pii]; 10.3390/vaccines13030272 [doi],de Bruin O; Nab L; Choi J; Ryan O; Uh HW; Ahmadizar F; Shmuel S; Rubino H; Bloemenkamp K; de Luise C; Sturkenboom M,ORCID: 0000-0001-6295-3411; ORCID: 0000-0003-3698-6396; ORCID: 0000-0003-4195-7872; ORCID: 0000-0002-6261-9445,,,,"S.S., H.R. and C.D. are employees of Pfizer, Inc and have received Pfizer stock.

34001754,"To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world  implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home orders. Numerous studies aim to estimate the effects of these policies. Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements, and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. Although these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. Target trial emulation emphasizes the need to carefully design a nonexperimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement-and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (""panel"") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design that we refer to as policy trial emulation. This approach is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each treatment cohort (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from panel methods-with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics-can help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging.","From the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University,  Cambridge, MA.; Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA.; Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California, Berkeley, CA.; Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  Baltimore, MD.",00001648-202107000-00010 [pii]; 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001369 [doi],Ben-Michael E; Feller A; Stuart EA,,"Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40492009,"AIM: This article presents the study protocol of a retrospective cohort study  designed to compare the effectiveness of herpes zoster, and influenza vaccines in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), or chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRD) to individuals without these diseases, using claims data of one of the largest population based health insurances in Germany. BACKGROUND: Individuals with autoimmune diseases such as MS, IBD, and CIRD are more susceptible to vaccine preventable infectious diseases such as influenza and herpes zoster, due to the autoimmune disease itself, the presence of comorbidities and immunosuppressive therapies. Vaccines are the primary means to prevent such diseases. The efficacy of these vaccines is usually estimated using large randomized controlled trials, from which patients with MS, IBD, and CIRD are often excluded. It is therefore unclear whether these vaccines are also effective for these patients. DESIGN: A target trial emulation based on observational claims data of a statutory health insurance company is proposed. METHODS: This study will aim to emulate multiple target trials to compare the effectiveness of herpes zoster and influenza vaccines in patients with and without MS, IBD and CIRD using data from a large German statutory health insurance provider (BARMER). The primary outcome for each vaccine effectiveness analysis is the disease itself. The analysis will be carried out using both time-dependent matching and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model in conjunction with g-computation. Additionally, the moderating effect of immunosuppressive therapies on the vaccine effectiveness will be estimated using a stratified secondary analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will estimate and compare the effectiveness of influenza and herpes zoster vaccines in individuals with and without MS, IBD, and CIRD. Because of the large amount of data, this study will also be able to investigate the role of the immunosuppressive medication on vaccine effectiveness, which may provide guidance for vaccine administration guidelines.","Department of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, Ruhr University  Bochum, Bochum, Germany.;

38902080,"BACKGROUND: Older adults with multimorbidity are at high risk of mortality  following COVID-19 hospitalisation. However, the potential benefit of timely primary care follow-up on severe outcomes post-COVID-19 has not been well established. AIM: To examine the effectiveness of attending general outpatient within 30 days after discharge from COVID-19 on 1-year survival among older adults aged ≥85 years, with multimorbidity. METHOD: We emulated a target trial using a comprehensive public healthcare database in Hong Kong. The cloning-censoring-weighting technique was used to minimise immortal time bias and confounding bias by adjusting for demographics, hospitalisation duration and ICU admission, baseline chronic conditions, and medication history. The outcome included all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Of 6183 eligible COVID-19 survivors, the all-cause mortality rate following COVID-19 hospitalisation was lower in general out-patient clinics (GOPC) group compared to non-GOPC group (17.1 versus 42.8 deaths per 100 person-year). After adjustment, primary care consultations within 30 days after discharge were associated with a significantly greater 1-year survival (difference in 1-year survival: 11.2%, 95% CI = 8.1% to 14.4%). We also observed better survival from respiratory diseases in the GOPC group. In a sensitivity analysis for different grace period lengths, we found that the earlier participants had a GOPC visit after COVID-19 discharge, the better the survival. CONCLUSION: Timely primary care consultations after discharge may improve survival following COVID-19 hospitalisation among older adults aged ≥85 years, with multimorbidity. Expanding primary care services and implementing follow-up mechanisms are crucial to support this vulnerable population's recovery and well-being.",The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; The University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.; University of Hong Kong.,74/suppl_1/bjgp24X737517 [pii]; 10.3399/bjgp24X737517 [doi],Wei C; Vincent; Yan KC; Maringe C; Rachel; Chu YK; Liu W; Liu B; Hu Y; Zhou L; Celine; Chui SL; Li X; Eric; Wan YF; Cheung CL; Esther; Chan WY; William; Wong CW; Ian; Wong CK; Lai F,,© British Journal of General Practice 2024.,,,,,2024/06/20 21:53,20240620,20240620,2024 Jun 20,2024/06/21 00:42,,,"Wei, Cuiling; Vincent; Yan, Ka Chun; Maringe, Camille; Rachel; Chu, Yui Ki; Liu, Wenlong; Liu, Boyan; Hu, Yuqi; Zhou, Lingyue; Celine; Chui, Sze Ling; Li, Xue; Eric; Wan, Yuk Fai; Cheung, Ching Lung; Esther; Chan, Wai Yin; William; Wong, Chi Wai; Ian; Wong, Chi Kei; Lai, Francisco",,,suppl 1,,1478-5242,0960-1643,,9005323,The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of  General Practitioners,eng,bjgp24X737517 [pii]; 10.3399/bjgp24X737517 [doi],20250626,"Humans; *COVID-19/mortality/epidemiology/therapy; *Multimorbidity; Male; Female; Aged, 80 and over; *Primary Health Care; *SARS-CoV-2; Hong Kong/epidemiology; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data",2024/06/21 00:43,,,,,,NLM,,,2024/06/20 21:53,2024/06/21 00:43,,,2024/06/21 00:42,,England,,,epublish,Journal Article,,IM,,Br J Gen Pract. 2024 Jun 20;74(suppl 1):bjgp24X737517. doi:  10.3399/bjgp24X737517.,MEDLINE,Br J Gen Pract,Effectiveness of post-COVID-19 primary care attendance in improving survival in  very old patients with multimorbidity: a territory-wide target trial emulation.,,,,74
38723213,"PURPOSE: Decision about the optimal timing of a treatment procedure in patients  with hematologic neoplasms is critical, especially for cellular therapies (most including allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation [HSCT]). In the absence of evidence from randomized trials, real-world observational data become beneficial to study the effect of the treatment timing. In this study, a framework to estimate the expected outcome after an intervention in a time-to-event scenario is developed, with the aim of optimizing the timing in a personalized manner. METHODS: Retrospective real-world data are leveraged to emulate a target trial for treatment timing using multistate modeling and microsimulation. This case study focuses on myelodysplastic syndromes, serving as a prototype for rare cancers characterized by a heterogeneous clinical course and complex genomic background. A cohort of 7,118 patients treated according to conventional available treatments/evidence across Europe and United States is analyzed. The primary clinical objective is to determine the ideal timing for HSCT, the only curative option for these patients. RESULTS: This analysis enabled us to identify the most appropriate time frames for HSCT on the basis of each patient's unique profile, defined by a combination relevant patients' characteristics. CONCLUSION: The developed methodology offers a structured framework to address a relevant clinical issue in the field of hematology. It makes several valuable contributions: (1) novel insights into how to develop decision models to identify the most favorable HSCT timing, (2) evidence to inform clinical decisions in a real-world context, and (3) the incorporation of complex information into decision making. This framework can be applied to provide medical insights for clinical issues that cannot be adequately addressed through randomized clinical trials.","MOX-Modelling and Scientific Computing Laboratory, Politecnico di Milano,  Department of Mathematics, Milan, Italy.; Biostatistics Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Trieste,  Trieste, Italy.; Aging Research Center, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society,  Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.; Mathematical Institute, Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS, Milan, Italy.; Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS, Milan, Italy.; Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS, Milan, Italy.; Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS, Milan, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.; Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS, Milan, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.; Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University  Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.; MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.; Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.; Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hôpital  Saint-Louis/Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP)/University Paris 7, Paris, France.; Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

39288431,"It is unclear how much costs economic difficulties in families with children  incur to the health and social care sector. We examined the health and social service costs after families entered into, and transitioned out of, social assistance used as a proxy measure for economic difficulties. We analyzed register data on all Finnish children born in 1997 and used the non-randomized target trial framework. The two target trials of entry to economic difficulties (social assistance) and continued economic difficulties included 697 680 and 71 131 children-year observations, respectively, in total. Inverse probability treatment weighting techniques were used to make the comparison group similar to the treatment group in terms of health, socioeconomic and demographic-related pretreatment variables. Entry to social assistance use was associated with some 1511-2619€ (50% compared to the control group) higher cumulative health and social care costs of the children three years after their families transitioned to social assistance, compared to the group that did not enter to social assistance system. This difference was primarily attributed to higher social care costs. Continued social assistance use was associated with some 1007-2709€ (31%) higher costs compared to the comparison group that exited social assistance. These findings support an economic argument to prevent families from entering economic difficulties and to help those in such situations to transition out.","Laboratory of Population Health, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research,  Rostock, Germany.; Max Planck-University of Helsinki Center for Social Inequalities in Population  Health, Rostock, Germany.; Department of Data and Analytics, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare,  Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Public Health, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki,  Finland.; Itla Children's Foundation, Helsinki, Finland.; Itla Children's Foundation, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki,  Helsinki, Finland.",7759690 [pii]; ckae140 [pii]; 10.1093/eurpub/ckae140 [doi],Hiilamo A; Keski-Säntti M; Juutinen A; Mäkinen L; Ristikari T; Lallukka T,ORCID: 0000-0003-3841-3129,© The Author(s) 2024.

38713002,"OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes for 2 weeks vs. 1 week of maximal  patient-intensivist continuity in the ICU. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Two U.S. urban, teaching, medical ICUs where intensivists were scheduled for 2-week service blocks: site A was in the Midwest and site B was in the Northeast. PATIENTS: Patients 18 years old or older admitted to a study ICU between March 1, 2017, and February 28, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We applied target trial emulation to compare admission during an intensivist's first week (as a proxy for 2 wk of maximal continuity) vs. admission during their second week (as a proxy for 1 wk of maximal continuity). Outcomes included hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, and, for mechanically ventilated patients, duration of ventilation. Exploratory outcomes included imaging, echocardiogram, and consultation orders. We used inverse probability weighting to adjust for baseline differences and random-effects meta-analysis to calculate overall effect estimates. Among 2571 patients, 1254 were admitted during an intensivist's first week and 1317 were admitted during a second week. At sites A and B, hospital mortality rates were 25.8% and 24.2%, median ICU length of stay were 4 and 2 days, and median mechanical ventilation durations were 3 and 3 days, respectively. There were no differences in adjusted mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.01 [95% CI, 0.96-1.06]) or ICU length of stay (-0.25 d [-0.82 d to +0.32 d]) for 2 weeks vs. 1 week of maximal continuity. Among mechanically ventilated patients, there were no differences in adjusted mortality (OR, 1.00 [0.87-1.16]), ICU length of stay (+0.06 d [-0.78 d to +0.91 d]), or duration of mechanical ventilation (+0.37 d [-0.46 d to +1.21 d]) for 2 weeks vs. 1 week of maximal continuity. CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks of maximal patient-intensivist continuity was not associated with differences in clinical outcomes compared with 1 week in two medical ICUs.","Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health,  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.; VA Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann  Arbor, MI.; Pulmonary Service, Medicine Service, LTC Charles S.

38076325,"BACKGROUND: Adult preventive health checkups with depression screening were  launched in August 2011 in Taiwan; however, its impact has not yet been evaluated. This study aimed to use real-world data to assess the effectiveness of depression screening among middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: A total of 4,972,228 adults aged 40 years and above who participated in a health checkup with depression screening between 2013 and 2019 and the same number of unscreened counterparts were included. The target trial emulation study was conducted to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for newly treated depression, psychiatric hospitalisation, and suicide. The changes in HRs during the study period were assessed using interval Cox models. FINDINGS: The screening group had a higher rate of newly treated depression (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.62, 1.64]) and a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalisation (HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.91, 0.95]). There was a null association between depression screening and suicide; however, a higher suicide risk was found in screened older adults aged 65 years and above. Only 10.8% received depression treatment during the study period among the screen-positive individuals. INTERPRETATION: Health checkups with depression screening could potentially promote depression treatment and reduce the risk of psychiatric hospitalisation; however, there was no effect on suicide. The treatment rate for depression remained low after screening for depression. Further attention to enhance referral and treatment is required. FUNDING: The study was funded by the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan.","National Center for Geriatrics and Welfare Research, National Health Research  Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan.; Department of Physical Education, National Taiwan University of Sport, Taichung,  Taiwan.; National Center for Geriatrics and Welfare Research, National Health Research  Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan.; National Center for Geriatrics and Welfare Research, National Health Research  Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan.; Department of Occupational Safety and Health, College of Public Health, China  Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Health Promotion and Health Education, National Taiwan Normal  University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Hisn-Chu Branch,  Hsinchu, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University,  Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan,  Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University,  Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Yunlin Branch,  Yunlin, Taiwan.; National Center for Geriatrics and Welfare Research, National Health Research  Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University,  Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Yunlin Branch,  Yunlin, Taiwan.; National Center for Geriatrics and Welfare Research, National Health Research  Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan.; Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes,  Zhunan, Taiwan.",S2666-6065(23)00296-1 [pii]; 100978 [pii]; 10.1016/j.lanwpc.2023.100978 [doi],Chen YL; Wu MS; Wang SH; Lien YJ; Liao SC; Chang CM; Huang WL; Wu CS; Hsu CC,,© 2023 The Author(s).,,,"During preparing this work, the authors used ChatGPT-3.5 and Grammarly to enhance  writing quality and rectify grammar errors.

40453061,"Ibrutinib, a once-daily Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a standard-of-care  first-line (1L) treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Dosing flexibility (adjustment to daily dose of <420 mg/d) with ibrutinib can help prevent recurrence or worsening of adverse events while maintaining long-term efficacy. This study compared time to next treatment among patients with CLL/SLL in the United States initiating 1L single-agent ibrutinib at 420 mg/d (index date) and staying on this dose vs patients with dose adjustment (DA) within 3 to 12 months. Two databases were used: Komodo claims (a majority from community practices) and Acentrus electronic medical records (from academic and nonteaching hospital systems). To account for immortal time bias (patients with DA survived on 1L therapy until DA) and overlap between follow-up time and definition of treatment strategies, a target trial emulation approach was used, in which patients were cloned at index date and contributed follow-up to both treatment strategy arms until deviation from the strategy. Among 3343 patients in Komodo (mean age: 67.5 years; 37.6% female) and 1171 patients in Acentrus (mean age: 70.4 years; 34.6% female) who initiated 1L single-agent ibrutinib 420 mg/d, 18.0% and 19.6%, respectively, had a DA. DA was not associated with an increased risk of having a next treatment in both databases (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: Komodo: 0.95 [0.80-1.14], Acentrus: 1.14 [0.80-1.62]). These findings suggest that a flexible dosing approach with ibrutinib may be effective in allowing patients to achieve optimal outcomes while remaining on long-term continuous 1L treatment.","Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Charlotte,  NC.; Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company, Horsham, PA.; Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company, Horsham, PA.; Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company, Horsham, PA.; Analysis Group, Inc, Montréal, QC, Canada.; Analysis Group, Inc, Montréal, QC, Canada.; Analysis Group, Inc, Montréal, QC, Canada.; Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company, Horsham, PA.; Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company, Horsham, PA.; Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company, Horsham, PA.; Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.",S2950-3280(24)00022-0 [pii]; 100022 [pii]; 10.1016/j.bneo.2024.100022 [doi],Ghosh N; Wang R; Qureshi ZP; Ding Z; Lafeuille MH; Emond B; Moore B; He J; Bokun A; Mavani H; Rogers KA,,"© 2024 by The American Society of Hematology.

38055276,"IMPORTANCE: There are limited data for the utility of statins for primary  prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and death in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of statin use with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among US veterans older than 65 years with CKD stages 3 to 4. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used a target trial emulation design for statin initiation among veterans with moderate CKD (stages 3 or 4) using nested trials with a propensity weighting approach. Linked Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System, Medicare, and Medicaid data were used. This study considered veterans newly diagnosed with moderate CKD between 2005 and 2015 in the VA, with follow-up through December 31, 2017. Veterans were older than 65 years, within 5 years of CKD diagnosis, had no prior ASCVD or statin use, and had at least 1 clinical visit in the year prior to trial baseline. Eligibility criteria were assessed for each nested trial, and Cox proportional hazards models with bootstrapping were run. Analysis was conducted from July 2021 to October 2023. EXPOSURE: Statin initiation vs none. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality; secondary outcome was time to first MACE (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, revascularization, or mortality). RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 14 828 veterans. Mean (SD) age at CKD diagnosis was 76.9 (8.2) years, 14 616 (99%) were men, 10 539 (72%) White, and 2568 (17%) Black. After expanding to person-trials and assessing eligibility at each baseline, there were 151 243 person-trials (14 685 individuals) of nonstatin initiators and 2924 person-trials (2924 individuals) of statin initiators included. Propensity score adjustment via overlap weighting with nonparametric bootstrapping resulted in covariate balance, with mean (SD) follow-up of 3.6 (2.7) years. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97) comparing statin initiators to noninitiators. The hazard ratio for MACE was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91-1.02). Results remained consistent in prespecified subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this target trial emulation of statin initiation in US veterans older than 65 years with CKD stages 3 to 4 and no prior ASCVD, statin initiation was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality but not MACE. Results should be confirmed in a randomized clinical trial.","Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel.; New England Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Bedford and Boston,  Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA  Boston Healthcare System, Boston.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA  Boston Healthcare System, Boston.; VA Boston Healthcare System, Department of Pharmacy, Boston, Massachusetts.; New England Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Bedford and Boston,  Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Renal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital  and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Renal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital  and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Section of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of  Medicine, Stanford, California.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Palo Alto VA Medical Center,  Palo Alto, California.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA  Boston Healthcare System, Boston.; Division of Aging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston,  Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA  Boston Healthcare System, Boston.; Division of Aging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston,  Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA  Boston Healthcare System, Boston.; Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston,  Massachusetts.; New England Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Bedford and Boston,  Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA  Boston Healthcare System, Boston.; Division of Aging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston,  Massachusetts.",2812582 [pii]; zoi231355 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.46373 [doi],Barayev O; Hawley CE; Wellman H; Gerlovin H; Hsu W; Paik JM; Mandel EI; Liu CK; Djoussé L; Gaziano JM; Gagnon DR; Orkaby AR,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Wellman reported receiving personal fees  from Novartis Inc outside the submitted work.

39672324,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of molnupiravir for high-risk adults in  a highly vaccinated Asian population is sparse. In this study, we aimed to estimate the association between molnupiravir use and hospital admission or death in high-risk adults with COVID-19 during the Omicron era. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included high-risk patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Shimonoseki City between September 16, 2022, and May 8, 2023. The outcome was a composite of hospital admission or death within 28 days. Participants were categorized into two groups: those who used molnupiravir within 5 days of diagnosis and those who did not. The outcomes were compared using a Cox proportional hazards model. Treatment weighting was used to balance patient backgrounds between the groups, and the clone method with inverse probability of censoring weighting was used to adjust for informative censoring. RESULTS: We analyzed 330 patients (190 females, 57.6 %) with a mean age of 68.6 years. The proportion of fully vaccinated and boosted patients was 82.9 % (155/187) in the molnupiravir group and 90.2 % (129/143) in the control group. The overall 28-day incidence of all-cause hospitalization and mortality was 5.2 % (17/330), with 3.2 % (6/187) in the molnupiravir group and 7.7 % (11/143) in the control group. Molnupiravir was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions or death within 28 days (weighted hazard ratio, 0.35 [95 % confidence intervals, 0.13 to 0.90]). CONCLUSIONS: Molnupiravir was linked to fewer hospitalizations or deaths within 28 days compared to no treatment in highly vaccinated high-risk patients with COVID-19 in Japan.","Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Health Economics, School of Public  Health, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.

39902239,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of vaccination with a monovalent  covid-19 mRNA vaccine containing the omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant against severe covid-19 disease in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. DESIGN: Target trial emulation based on registry data. SETTING: Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, 1 October 2023 to 21 April 2024. PARTICIPANTS: Source population of 3 898 264 individuals eligible for vaccination with the XBB.1.5 containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine at the start of the study on 1 October 2023. Study cohort comprised 1 876 282 recipients of an XBB.1.5 containing vaccine during the study period matched with 1 876 282 non-recipients. Individuals were aged ≥65 years (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years) and had received at least four doses of a previous covid-19 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidences of hospital admissions and deaths related to covid-19 in a follow-up period of 24 weeks after immunisation (defined as one week after vaccination) in recipients of an XBB.1.5 containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences. RESULTS: The associated comparative vaccine effectiveness was 57.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.9% to 65.8%) against hospital admission for covid-19 (1085 v 2635 events) and 75.2% (70.6% to 79.9%) against deaths related to covid-19 disease (348 v 1458 events) after 24 weeks of follow-up. This result corresponded to 154.7 (95% CI 78.3 to 231.0) hospital admissions for covid-19 and 120.3 (110.5 to 130.2) deaths prevented per 100 000 individuals who were vaccinated with an XBB.1.5 containing vaccine. The associated comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar irrespective of sex, age group (65-74 v ≥75 years), number of doses of previous covid-19 vaccines, subgroup of co-administered seasonal influenza vaccines, and period of when either the omicron XBB or BA.2.86 sublineage was predominant. Although the observed reduction in risk was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, comparative vaccine effectiveness was well maintained after 24 weeks of follow-up.

39205656,"AIM: To investigate whether the physician-encounter interval for patients with  type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be optimized from 2-3 to 4-6 months among those with a calculated 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score of less than 20% without compromising their long-term outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using territory-wide public electronic medical records in Hong Kong, we emulated a target trial to compare the effectiveness of the physician-encounter intervals of 4-6 versus 2-3 months for T2D patients without prior CVDs and with a predicted risk for CVDs of less than 20% (i.e. those patients not in the high-risk category). Propensity score matching was used to emulate the randomization of participants at baseline, where 42 154 matched individuals were included for analysis. The marginal structural model was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for CVD incidence and all-cause mortality, the incidence rate ratio of secondary and tertiary care utilization, as well as the between-group differences in HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. RESULTS: During a follow-up period of up to 12 (average: 5.1) years, there was no significantly increased risk of CVD in patients with physician-encounter intervals of 4-6 months compared with those patients with physician-encounter intervals of 2-3 months (HR [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 1.01 [0.90, 1.14]; standardized 10-year risk difference [95% CI]: -0.1% [-0.7%, 0.6%]), nor for all-cause mortality (HR: 1.00 [0.84, 1.20]; standardized 10-year risk difference: -0.1% [-0.5%, 0.3%]). Additionally, there was no observable difference in the utilization of secondary and tertiary care or key clinical parameters between these two follow-up frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: For T2D patients with a calculated 10-year CVD risk of less than 20%, the interval of regular physician encounters can be optimized from 2-3 to 4-6 months without compromising patients' long-term outcomes and saving substantial service resources in primary care.","Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Medicine, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa,  Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Bruyere Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Family Medicine, The University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital,  Shenzhen, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The  University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong, China.",10.1111/dom.15899 [doi],Xu W; Wang Y; Tanuseputro P; Lam CLK; Wan EYF,ORCID: 0000-0002-6275-1147,"© 2024 The Author(s).

38012221,"This scoping review focuses on the essential role of models for causal inference  in shaping actionable artificial intelligence (AI) designed to aid clinicians in decision-making. The objective was to identify and evaluate the reporting quality of studies introducing models for causal inference in intensive care units (ICUs), and to provide recommendations to improve the future landscape of research practices in this domain. To achieve this, we searched various databases including Embase, MEDLINE ALL, Web of Science Core Collection, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and the ACM Digital Library. Studies involving models for causal inference addressing time-varying treatments in the adult ICU were reviewed. Data extraction encompassed the study settings and methodologies applied. Furthermore, we assessed reporting quality of target trial components (i.e., eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, follow-up period, outcome, and analysis plan) and main causal assumptions (i.e., conditional exchangeability, positivity, and consistency). Among the 2184 titles screened, 79 studies met the inclusion criteria. The methodologies used were G methods (61%) and reinforcement learning methods (39%). Studies considered both static (51%) and dynamic treatment regimes (49%). Only 30 (38%) of the studies reported all five target trial components, and only seven (9%) studies mentioned all three causal assumptions. To achieve actionable AI in the ICU, we advocate careful consideration of the causal question of interest, describing this research question as a target trial emulation, usage of appropriate causal inference methods, and acknowledgement (and examination of potential violations of) the causal assumptions.","Department of Intensive Care, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The  Netherlands. j.smit@erasmusmc.nl.; Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics group, EEMCS, Delft University of  Technology, Delft, The Netherlands. j.smit@erasmusmc.nl.; Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics group, EEMCS, Delft University of  Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.; Data Science group, Institute for Computing and Information Sciences, Radboud  University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London,  London, UK.; Intensive Care Unit, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS  Trust, London, UK.; Department of Intensive Care, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The  Netherlands.; Department of Intensive Care, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The  Netherlands.; Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics group, EEMCS, Delft University of  Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.; Department of Intensive Care, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The  Netherlands.",10.1038/s41746-023-00961-1 [pii]; 961 [pii]; 10.1038/s41746-023-00961-1 [doi],Smit JM; Krijthe JH; Kant WMR; Labrecque JA; Komorowski M; Gommers DAMPJ; van Bommel J; Reinders MJT; van Genderen ME,ORCID: 0000-0003-3716-1863; ORCID: 0000-0003-3435-6358; ORCID: 0009-0001-0411-2187; ORCID: 0000-0002-1148-1562; ORCID: 0000-0001-5668-3435,© 2023.

40388075,"BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that baclofen may reduce the risk of  osteoarthritis through its anti-inflammatory effect. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to clarify this association by comparing the risks of osteoarthritis and joint replacement surgery in patients receiving baclofen and tizanidine. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on the global TriNetX platform (October 31, 2024). New users of baclofen and tizanidine aged ≥40 years were included in the baclofen and tizanidine group, respectively. The propensity score matching method was used. The primary outcomes were osteoarthritis and joint replacement surgery. The secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, a composite outcome of osteoarthritis and all-cause mortality, and a composite outcome of joint replacement surgery and all-cause mortality. Cause specific hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the outcomes were calculated with Cox regression using the TriNetX platform. RESULTS: Two well-balanced groups containing 68,210 patients each were generated by propensity score matching (age: 57.8 years; female: 55.6% in both groups). Baclofen users had a significantly lower risk of developing osteoarthritis than tizanidine users (HR: 0.965, 95% CI: 0.941 to 0.989). A similar relationship was observed for joint replacement surgery (HR: 0.847, 95% CI: 0.750 to 0.956). However, the composite outcome of osteoarthritis or death had a HR of 1.129 (95% CI: 1.109 to 1.150), and the HR of joint replacement surgery or death was 1.509 (95% CI: 1.463 to 1.556). The HR of death was 1.577 (95% CI: 1.527 to 1.629), suggesting a higher risk of mortality in the baclofen group. CONCLUSION: The surviving baclofen users had a lower risk of osteoarthritis and joint replacement surgery compared to surviving tizanidine users. However, baclofen users exhibited a higher risk of mortality than tizanidine users. Future studies are necessary to clarify the impact of baclofen on osteoarthritis and joint replacement surgery while accounting for mortality.","Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, College of Medicine, National  Cheng Kung University Hospital, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University  Hospital, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, College of Medicine, National  Cheng Kung University Hospital, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. yuchinglin2011@gmail.com.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, College of Medicine, National  Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. yuchinglin2011@gmail.com.; , 138 Sheng-Li Road, Tainan, 70403, Taiwan. yuchinglin2011@gmail.com.",10.1007/s40261-025-01448-5 [pii]; 10.1007/s40261-025-01448-5 [doi],Su YC; Su YC; Lai EC; Lin YC,,"© 2025.

40286366,"BACKGROUND: Evidence is limited regarding the comparative effectiveness and  safety of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) vs catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) for high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). OBJECTIVES: This observational study aimed to compare the outcomes of older adults with high-risk PE treated with MT vs CDT using a target trial emulation framework. METHODS: We included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 to 99 years admitted with high-risk PE (defined by cardiac arrest, shock, and vasopressor use) who underwent MT/CDT from 2017 to 2020. We evaluated 1-year mortality using an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach, controlling for 62 baseline covariates. We also evaluated readmissions and in-hospital outcomes, including intracranial hemorrhage. Patients were followed from the date of the index procedure to the outcomes of interest, 1 year, or December 2020. RESULTS: We included 235 and 484 patients in the MT and CDT groups, respectively. The absolute risk of 1-year mortality was 48.4% (95% CI: 34.1%-63.3%) in the MT group and 45.4% (95% CI: 37.8%-55.8%) in the CDT group, with an adjusted HR of 1.16 (95% CI: 0.84-1.59). We found no evidence that all-cause readmission (MT vs CDT; subdistribution HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.56-1.40), intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.07-1.77), or transfusions (adjusted OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.52-1.76) differed significantly between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults with high-risk PE treated with catheter-based therapies, the clinical outcomes were similar between the patients treated with MT vs CDT. Randomized trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Morningside and West, Icahn School of  Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.; Cardiology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School,  Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

40369054,"Although renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) are the mainstay in the  management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular conditions, they are often discontinued due to hyperkalemia. The prognostic impact of discontinuing RASi after developing hyperkalemia remains uncertain. Using a target trial framework based on the cloning, censoring, and weighting method, we compared discontinuing RASi after incident hyperkalemia with continuing RASi. We identified 2305 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥10 ml/min/1.73 m(2) who developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels ≥5.5 mEq/L) while on RASi in the Osaka Consortium for Kidney Disease Research (OCKR) database. The primary outcome was a composite of initiation of kidney replacement therapy, a ≥50% decline in eGFR, or reaching eGFR <5 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Secondary outcomes included all-cause death and severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels ≥6.5 mEq/L). The mean (standard deviation) age and eGFR were 68 (14) years and 29 (17) mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. After developing hyperkalemia, 346 (15%) discontinued RASi. Discontinuing RASi was associated with a 16% [95% confidence interval 2-33%] higher hazard of mortality than continuing RASi while the composite kidney outcome did not differ between groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.01 [0.81-1.26]). Severe hyperkalemia occurred less frequently in those who discontinued RASi than those who continued RASi (adjusted HR 0.83 [0.69, 0.99]). RASi discontinuation after incident hyperkalemia was associated with higher mortality despite a lower risk of severe hyperkalemia. It was not related to kidney outcome. Appropriate clinical decision-making regarding RASi discontinuation may depend on the clinical context.","Department of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, Osaka General Medical Center,  Osaka, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan. sakaguchi@kid.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.; Department of Nephrology, Yodogawa Christian Hospital, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Toyonaka Municipal Hospital, Toyonaka, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Ikeda City Hospital, Ikeda, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Sakai City Medical Center, Sakai, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Health and Counseling Center, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.",10.1038/s41440-025-02218-8 [pii]; 2218 [pii]; 10.1038/s41440-025-02218-8 [doi],Hashimoto N; Sakaguchi Y; Hattori K; Kawano Y; Kawaoka T; Doi Y; Oka T; Kusunoki Y; Yamamoto S; Yamato M; Yamamoto R; Matsui I; Mizui M; Kaimori JY; Isaka Y,,© 2025.

39946994,"OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to determine the appropriate  gestational age for planned births by elective cesarean section (ECS) or induction of labor (IOL) in relation to no excess risk of neonatal respiratory distress. STUDY DESIGN: Register-based Swedish cohort study including 575,817 singleton live births at 36 weeks or later. Births not eligible for vaginal delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes and infants with congenital anomalies were excluded. The primary outcome was respiratory distress, and a secondary outcome was Apgar score <7 at five minutes. The risk of outcomes according to onset of birth was calculated for each day from gestational week 36 to 41 and compared with expectant management (EM), defined as births at least one day later. RESULTS: No excess risk of respiratory distress was found for ECS from 40 weeks and for IOL from 38 weeks compared with EM. At 37 weeks, the absolute risk of respiratory distress was 12.4 % for ECS (aRR:5.7; 95 %CI:4.8; 6.5) and 4.0 % for IOL (aRR:1.7; 95 %CI:1.5; 2.0). At 39 weeks, the absolute risk of respiratory distress for ECS was 3.2 % (aRR:1.6; 95 %CI:1.3; 1.8) whereas the risk was reduced for IOL. ECS <38 weeks increased the risk of Apgar <7 compared with EM. CONCLUSION: Regarding neonatal respiratory distress, IOL was safe from 38 weeks and ECS from 40 weeks. At earlier gestational ages, the risk of respiratory distress was significantly higher, which highlights the importance of clear health policies regarding appropriate timing and indications for planned births by ECS and IOL.","Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland; Department of  Obstetrics and Gynecology, Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland; Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

40436352,"AIMS: There's no scientific consensus on the best way to diagnose gestational  diabetes mellitus (GDM) globally. This study uses target trial emulation to assess different glycemic criteria for GDM diagnosis. METHODS: 38,995 singleton - pregnant women who took a 75 - g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-32 weeks of gestation were involved. Cloning, censoring, and inverse probability weighting were applied for emulation. Log - binomial regression estimated the effects of various criteria on adverse birth outcomes, and statistical significance and estimates were evaluated. RESULTS: 4,539 women (11.6 %) were diagnosed with lower criteria, 2,463 (6.3 %) with intermediate, and 1,744 (4.5 %) with higher criteria. The proportion of large - for - gestational - age (LGA) infants was 7.12 % in the lower criteria group and 8.26 % in the higher criteria group (RR = 0.96, 95 % CI: 0.90 to 1.02). Similar LGA risks were found between intermediate and lower criteria. All outcomes showed statistical significance and agreement with targeted trials. CONCLUSIONS: Lower glycemic criteria increased GDM diagnosis 2.53 - fold compared to higher criteria and 1.80 - fold relative to intermediate criteria, yet risks of LGA newborns and other issues remained unchanged.","Department of Clinical Research Center, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal  Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.; Clinical Center for Intelligent Rehabilitation Research, Shanghai Yang Zhi  Rehabilitation Hospital (Shanghai Sunshine Rehabilitation Center), School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Obstetrics, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal-Fetal Medicine,  Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.; Department of Obstetrics, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal-Fetal Medicine,  Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.; Department of Obstetrics, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal-Fetal Medicine,  Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.; Department of Obstetrics, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal-Fetal Medicine,  Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.; Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.; Department of Obstetrics, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal-Fetal Medicine,  Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.

39705032,"IMPORTANCE: Type 2 diabetes and hypertension are obesity-related, noncommunicable  diseases becoming increasingly common worldwide. In 2008, Japan launched a nationwide universal health checkup program, Specific Health Checkup (SHC), for the primary prevention of obesity-related diseases, but its effectiveness has been understudied. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the SHC program with incident diabetes and hypertension, using a target trial emulation framework. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data from a longitudinal health care database involving both checkup history and medical encounter records in Japan. Individuals aged 40 to 74 years, without diabetes or hypertension, and without a prior checkup history, were eligible. Individuals were repeatedly assessed for eligibility from April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2020, to assemble sequential cohorts of 78 620 SHC participants and 214 554 nonparticipants. Statistical analysis was conducted from June 8 to December 30, 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The composite risk of incident type 2 diabetes or hypertension over a period of up to 10 years, defined as the combination of a newly documented diagnosis and use of relevant medications. A propensity score-weighted survival analysis was conducted to adjust for baseline variables. A series of sensitivity analyses and a negative outcome control analysis were conducted using depression as a benchmark. RESULTS: Sequential cohorts consisted of 78 620 SHC participants (median age, 46 years [IQR, 41-53 years]; 62.7% women) and 214 554 nonparticipants (median age, 49 years [IQR, 44-55 years]; 82.0% women) from 153 084 unique persons, each of whom entered the study cohort a mean (SD) of 1.9 (1.5) times. Within a median follow-up of 4.2 years (IQR, 2.7-6.3 years), the primary end point occurred among 11.2% of all individuals (10.6% of the SHC participants and 11.4% of the nonparticipants), with a lower hazard ratio (HR) among the SHC recipients (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89-0.92); the difference in cumulative incidence at 10 years was -1.6% (95% CI, -1.8% to -1.3%). The sensitivity analyses showed similar results. The negative control analysis suggested the potential for residual confounding (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07); the bias-calibrated HR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.89) for the primary outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, within a median of 4.2 years of follow-up, SHC recipients had a 9.8% lower risk of incident diabetes and hypertension (13.8% in the bias-calibrated analysis). The cost-effectiveness of the SHC and its transportability to other regions are unclear, requiring future investigations.","Department of Public Health, Shizuoka Graduate University of Public Health,  Shizuoka, Japan.; Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Information and Computer Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo  University of Science, Katushika-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public  Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.",2828308 [pii]; zoi241442 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.51813 [doi],Takeuchi M; Shinozaki T; Kawakami K,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Takeuchi reported receiving personal fees  from Eisai Co Ltd during the conduct of the study.

38608193,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two different intravenous  methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse doses in patients with severe microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). METHODS: We emulated a target trial using observational data from the nationwide registry in Japan. Patients with severe glomerulonephritis or diffuse alveolar haemorrhage were selected and pseudo-randomized into three groups using propensity score-based overlap weighting as follows: non-IVMP, IVMP 0.5 g/day and IVMP 1.0 g/day. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes were composite all-cause mortality and kidney failure, severe relapse and serious infection from 2 to 48 weeks after treatment initiation. To estimate the treatment effects, the Cox proportional hazard model and Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model were used. RESULTS: In this emulated target trial, of 201 eligible patients (MPA, 175; GPA, 26), 6 (3%) died, 4 (2.0%) had kidney failure, 11 (5.5%) had severe relapse, and 40 (19.9%) had severe infections. Hazard ratios (HR) for IVMP 0.5 g/day and IVMP 1.0 g/day pulse groups compared with non-IVMP pulse were as follows: all-cause mortality 0.46 (95% CI: 0.07, 2.81) and 0.07 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.41), respectively; all-cause mortality/kidney failure 1.18 (95% CI: 0.26, 5.31) and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.08, 4.52), respectively; subdistribution HRs for severe relapse were 1.26 (95% CI: 0.12, 13.70) and 3.36 (95% CI: 0.49, 23.29), respectively; and for serious infection 1.88 (95% CI: 0.76, 4.65) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.28, 3.13), respectively. CONCLUSION: IVMP 1.0 g/day pulse may improve 48-week mortality in patients with severe MPA/GPA.","Inflammation and Immunology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto  Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.;

40526989,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that  glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists (GLP1-ras) may offer neuroprotective and cardiovascular benefits. However, concerns have been raised about potential adverse effects of GLP1-ras including depression and suicidal ideation. This target-trial-emulation study aims to examine the effects of GLP1-ras treatment on psychiatric hospital admission and all-cause mortality in individuals with schizophrenia. METHODS: We used the Danish nationwide registers to identify all individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and who were treated with metformin (Glucophage). Among these, we identified those who initiated second-line treatment for type-2-diabetes with one of the following glucose-lowering drugs: GLP1-ras, sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2-inhibitors(SGLT2is), or dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-inhibitors(DPP-4is). We then compared the hazard rate ratios(HRR) for psychiatric admission and all-cause mortality between the different treatment arms using a Cox-proportional-hazards model, adjusting for covariates to minimize confounding. RESULTS: We included 354 individuals with schizophrenia(47 % female, mean age 43.8 years) and type-2-diabetes who initiated treatment with a second-line GLD. Of these, 71, 197, and 86 initiated treatment with GLP1-ras, DPP-4is, and SGLT2is respectively. We found no difference in the risk of psychiatric admission between the three treatment arms. In the fully adjusted model, treatment with DPP-4is and SGLT2is analysed as a compound exposure, was not associated with a significant reduced risk of psychiatric admission, with a HRR of 0.78(95 %-CI:0.38-1.59), when compared to GLP1-ras. Only 5 deaths occurred during follow-up, making a comparison of all-cause mortality between the treatment arms unfeasible. CONCLUSION: We observed no difference in the risk of psychiatric admission or all-cause mortality for individuals with schizophrenia treated with GLP1-ras compared to SGLT2is and DPP-4is.","Psychosis Research Unit, Aarhus University Hospital - Psychiatry, Aarhus,  Denmark; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.

40054684,"OBJECTIVES: Global countries often apply containment policies (CPs) to combat  infectious disease surges. Whether countries with longer cumulative duration of CPs are associated with slower long-term epidemic progression necessitates a thorough evaluation. METHODS: We collected CP and COVID-19 data of 185 territories during 2020-2022, with a total of 23 CPs. Using the target trial emulation and cloning-censoring-weighting approaches, we assessed the effectiveness of CPs with different cumulative durations in delaying countries from reaching the 1% and 10% cumulative infection incidence end points (i.e. 10,000 and 100,000 COVID-19 cases per million population, respectively) over a 3-year observation period. RESULTS: For reaching the 1% cumulative infection incidence, recommending closing workplaces and limiting gatherings to 10 people, each presented that a longer cumulative duration of those CPs is associated with a lower proportion of countries achieving this end point throughout 2020-2022. For reaching the 10% cumulative infection incidence, mandatory bans on public events and domestic movements, closing public transports, and screening and quarantining inbound tourists, each showed similar associations. Notably, long-lasting border bans upon high-risk regions are associated with a higher proportion of countries reaching the 10% cumulative infection incidence. CONCLUSIONS: From the long-term perspective, we highlight CPs that warrant extending the duration to achieve slower epidemic progression. By contrast, our findings demonstrate the limited effectiveness of the ban on regions in slowing the long-term epidemic progression.","Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for  Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen  University, Guangzhou, China; Clinical Research Design Division, Clinical Research Center, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.

39903865,"BACKGROUND: Monovalent COVID-19 vaccines targeting the XBB.1.5 Omicron variant  were introduced in September 2023. In the absence of randomized controlled trials demonstrating their efficacy, information on real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) is needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine XBB.1.5 COVID-19 VE and the extent to which it declines over time. DESIGN: Target trial emulation. SETTING: U.S. Veterans Health Administration. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible XBB.1.5 vaccine recipients were matched 1:1 to unvaccinated persons in 7 sequential biweekly trials with enrollment from 2 October 2023 through 3 January 2024. INTERVENTION: XBB.1.5 COVID-19 vaccination versus no XBB.1.5 vaccination. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were ascertained through 10 May 2024 and included any positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 test from day 10 after the matched index date, subsequent hospitalization within 1 day before or 10 days after the positive result, or death within 30 days after the positive result. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 100 × (1 - risk ratio). RESULTS: Participants (91.3% male; mean age, 69.9 years) included 587 137 pairs of vaccinated and matched unvaccinated persons. Over a mean follow-up of 176 days (range, 118 to 211 days), VE was -3.26% (95% CI, -6.78% to -0.22%) against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, 16.64% (CI, 6.47% to 25.77%) against SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization, and 26.61% (CI, 5.53% to 42.32%) against SARS-CoV-2-associated death. When estimated at 60, 90, and 120 days, respectively, VE against documented infection (14.21%, 7.29%, and 3.15%), hospitalization (37.57%, 30.84%, and 25.25%), or death (54.24%, 44.33%, and 30.25%) showed substantial waning. LIMITATION: Potential for residual confounding and incomplete capture of COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccines targeting the XBB.1.5 variant of Omicron were not effective in preventing infection and had relatively low VE against hospitalization and death, which declined rapidly over time.

40688569,"BACKGROUND: Bacteremias caused by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing  Enterobacterales are a critical challenge due to their limited treatment options. Although ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZAVI) combined with aztreonam (ATM) has shown in vitro efficacy, no prior studies have rigorously compared its clinical effectiveness to Other Active Antibiotics (OAAs). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAZAVI + ATM vs. OAAs in a large cohort of MBL bacteremia. METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter, target trial emulation was conducted across 17 hospitals in Argentina between January 2016 and October 2024. Patients with confirmed MBL bacteremia who initiated active antibiotic treatment within 24 h of MBL identification and 96 h of blood sampling were included. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to reduce indication bias, and the analysis accounted for hospital clustering within Argentina's public, private, and social security health systems. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes including clinical failure (relapse, complications, or death) and adverse events. FINDINGS: Among 243 patients (93 receiving CAZAVI + ATM and 150 receiving OAAs), the 30-day mortality rate was 35% in the CAZAVI + ATM group vs. 47% in the OAA group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·63, 95% CI 0·43-0·91, p < 0·01). Clinical failure occurred in 46% of the CAZAVI + ATM group and 53% of the OAA group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·65, 95% CI 0·44-0·97; p = 0·03). Adverse events were lower with CAZAVI + ATM (9·6% vs. 22·8%, p = 0·014). INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest CAZAVI + ATM might be associated with lower mortality, reduced clinical failure, and fewer adverse events compared to OAAs in patients with MBL-type Enterobacterales bacteremia. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations.

40142881,"Background/Objectives: Premature infants are often referred for the definitive  procedural closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with the failure of, or contraindication to, pharmacotherapy and the inability to wean respiratory support. However, once this need is identified, the importance of expedited closure is unclear. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of the timing of definitive closure (i.e., surgical ligation or device occlusion) on early respiratory outcomes in premature infants. Method: We first specify a hypothetical randomized trial (the ""target trial"") that would estimate the effect on extubation of early (0-4 days from referral) vs. late (5-14 days from referral) definitive PDA closure. We then emulate this target trial using a single-institution registry of premature infants (born <30 weeks or with a birth weight < 1500 g) who underwent the definitive closure of PDA between January 2014 and October 2023. Results: We identify 131 eligible infants. At the end of the follow-up, 70 and 38 infants were adherent to early and late PDA closure strategies, respectively. The cumulative incidence of extubation in the early group was higher than that in the late group until day 40 (maximum risk difference: 22 percentage points at day 13; 95% CI: -11 to 56). Outcomes were similar at the end of the 45-day follow-up period (risk difference: -1 percentage point; 95% CI: -46 to 42). Conclusions: The need for mechanical ventilation was equivalent between early and late PDA closure strategies at the end of a 45-day follow-up period although infants in the early intervention group were extubated sooner.","Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Departments of Respiratory Care & Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, Boston  Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Department of Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.

40371165,"BACKGROUND: Acute leukemia is the most common malignancy in children. While  chemotherapy is effective, it significantly compromises immune function, leading to a high incidence of infectious complications, such as secondary pneumonia, particularly Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP). The treatment of infections in pediatric leukemia patients faces challenges such as antibiotic resistance and drug interactions during chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of doxycycline in treating MP in pediatric leukemia patients post-chemotherapy, as well as it impact on chemotherapy continuity. METHODS: This study employed a target trial emulation design using retrospective data from pediatric leukemia patients diagnosed with MP. Patients aged 12-17 years with confirmed leukemia and clinical evidence of pneumonia following chemotherapy were included. Doxycycline was compared to azithromycin and other empirical treatments. Follow-up assessments at 3 days, 5 days, 30 days, and 180 days evaluated fever resolution, radiological improvement, additional interventions, and adverse events. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: In Trial 2, doxycycline demonstrated a significantly higher treatment success rate than other empirical treatments (87.72% vs. 73.13%, P = 0.013) and was associated with faster fever resolution (P = 0.048) and shorter time to chest X-ray improvement (P = 0.048). The 30-day survival rate was significantly higher in the Doxycycline group compared to other empirical treatments (100% vs. 91.04%, P = 0.019). Fewer patients require additional interventions such as ICU admission (P = 0.019). Furthermore, patients in the Doxycycline group had a significantly higher likelihood of completing chemotherapy without delays (84.21% vs. 59.70%, P = 0.01). In Trial 1, no significant differences were observed in treatment success rate, fever resolution time, hospitalization duration, or chemotherapy tolerance between Doxycycline and Azithromycin (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Doxycycline, as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, demonstrates efficacy comparable to azithromycin in treating MP with advantages in reducing chemotherapy-related delays, hospitalization duration, and the need for additional interventions. It enhances chemotherapy tolerance and continuity. Doxycycline may serve as an economical and effective alternative for managing post-chemotherapy infections in pediatric leukemia patients, especially in cases of antibiotic resistance or intolerance.","Emergency Department, Xi'an Children's Hospital Xi'an 710000, Shaanxi, China.; Emergency Department, Xi'an Children's Hospital Xi'an 710000, Shaanxi, China.; Emergency Department, Xi'an Children's Hospital Xi'an 710000, Shaanxi, China.; Emergency Department, Xi'an Children's Hospital Xi'an 710000, Shaanxi, China.; Hematology Department, Xi'an Children's Hospital Xi'an 710000, Shaanxi, China.; Information Department, Xi'an Children's Hospital Xi'an 710000, Shaanxi, China.; Emergency Department, Xi'an Children's Hospital Xi'an 710000, Shaanxi, China.",10.62347/KGBQ9641 [doi],Wen J; Xu X; Su Y; Qi X; Fu Q; Chen M; Wang X,,AJCR Copyright © 2025.,,,The authors declare that the study was conducted without any financial or  commercial relationships that could be construed as potential conflicts of interest.,,2025/05/15 04:55,,20250415,2025,2025/05/15 11:20,,,"Wen, Jun; Xu, Xiaoyan; Su, Yufei; Qi, Xuehao; Fu, Qiang; Chen, Mingjiang; Wang, Xue",,,4,,2156-6976,2156-6976,2156-6976,101549944,American journal of cancer research,eng,10.62347/KGBQ9641 [doi],20250516,,2025/05/15 11:21,,,,Doxycycline; chemotherapy delay; mycoplasma pneumonia; pediatric leukemia; target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,1790-1805,2025/03/19 00:00,2025/05/15 04:55,2025/05/15 11:21,,2025/04/15 00:00,2025/05/15 11:20,2025/01/21 00:00,United States,PMC12070108,2025/04/15,epublish,Journal Article,,,,Am J Cancer Res. 2025 Apr 15;15(4):1790-1805. doi: 10.62347/KGBQ9641. eCollection  2025.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Am J Cancer Res,Impact of doxycycline on mycoplasma pneumonia treatment and cancer prognosis in  pediatric leukemia patients post-chemotherapy: a target trial emulation.,,,,15
39169475,"BACKGROUND: The target trial framework was developed as a strategy to design and  analyze observational epidemiologic studies with the aim of reducing bias due to analytic decisions. It involves designing a hypothetical randomized trial to answer a question of interest and systematically considering how to use observational data to emulate each trial component. AIMS: The primary aim of this paper is to provide a detailed example of the application of the target trial framework to a research question in oral epidemiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the development of a hypothetical target trial and emulation protocol to evaluate the effect of preconception periodontitis treatment on time-to-pregnancy. We leverage data from Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), a preconception cohort, to ground our example in existing observational data. We discuss the decision-making process for each trial component, as well as limitations encountered. RESULTS: Our target trial application revealed data limitations that precluded us from carrying out the proposed emulation. Implications for data quality are discussed and we provide recommendations for researchers interested in conducting trial emulations in the field of oral epidemiology. DISCUSSION: The target trial framework has the potential to improve the validity of observational research in oral health, when properly applied. CONCLUSION: We encourage the broad adoption of the target trial framework to the field of observational oral health research and demonstrate its value as a tool to identify directions for future research.","Department of Health Policy and Health Services Research, Boston University Henry  M.

40522319,"BACKGROUND: Consensus guidelines from China recommend adjuvant transarterial  chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are at high risk of recurrence after curative resection. However, some of the clinical evidence behind this recommendation involves patients who underwent palliative resection. METHODS: The study design followed the target trial emulation framework with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and propensity score matching (PSM) to minimize biases. This study compared recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) during follow-up among patients who received TACE after truly curative resection, defined as absence of tumor staining during postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA); patients who received TACE after palliative resection; and patients who received only active surveillance after both kinds of resection. RESULTS: Patients who received TACE showed significantly higher RFS (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.93) and OS (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.98). However, adjuvant TACE after truly curative resection was associated with marginally, but not significantly, higher RFS (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80-1.08) and OS (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70-1.06) than active surveillance. The patients who underwent palliative resection, therapeutic TACE was associated with longer RFS (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56-0.87) and OS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.83) than active surveillance. These similar results with both types of survival were found after PSM and IPTW. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant TACE may not improve survival of HCC patients at high risk of recurrence. Our work highlights the efficacy of DSA for detecting microscopic lesions and could help guide adjuvant treatment decisions after hepatic resection.","Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Interventional Radiology Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guigang City People's Hospital, Guigang, China.; Medical Records and Statistics Department, Wuzhou People's Hospital, Wuzhou,  China.; General Surgery Department, Wuzhou People's Hospital, Wuzhou, China.; General Surgery Department, Wuzhou People's Hospital, Wuzhou, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Hepatobiliary Surgery Department, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital,  Nanning, China.; Key Laboratory of Early Prevention and Treatment for Regional High Frequency  Tumor (Guangxi Medical University), Ministry of Education, Nanning, China.; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Early Prevention and Treatment for Regional High  Frequency Tumor, Nanning, China.",10.1111/hepr.14219 [doi],Su JY; Huang DJ; Liu SP; Xu XL; Chen SC; Ou JJ; Li JR; Yang TX; Li WY; Fan Y; Wen ZC; Chen L; Qin Z; Long BB; Li DZ; Huang JH; Lu YJ; Zhong JC; Zhu HQ; Ma L; Liang XM; Zhong JH,ORCID: 0000-0002-0960-5394; ORCID: 0009-0005-2609-058X; ORCID: 0000-0002-1494-6396,© 2025 Japan Society of Hepatology.,,,,,2025/06/16 10:54,,20250616,2025 Jun 16,2025/06/16 12:27,,,"Su, Jia-Yong; Huang, De-Jia; Liu, Shao-Ping; Xu, Xiao-Ling; Chen, Shu-Chang; Ou, Jun-Jie; Li, Jian-Rong; Yang, Tai-Xin; Li, Wen-Yang; Fan, Yuan; Wen, Zhao-Chan; Chen, Le; Qin, Zhen; Long, Bei-Bei; Li, Da-Zhi; Huang, Jiang-Hong; Lu, Yi-Jia; Zhong, Jun-Chi; Zhu, Hai-Qiang; Ma, Liang; Liang, Xiu-Mei; Zhong, Jian-Hong",,GuiKe AB25069099/Guangxi Key Research and Development Plan/; GuiKe AB24010082/Guangxi Key Research and Development Plan/; GuiKe AD22035042/Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Talent Special Fund/; YCSW2023245/Innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education/; GXMULJZ202403/Clinical Discipline Construction Project of Guangxi Medical  University/; First-Class Discipline Innovation-Driven Talent Program of Guangxi Medical  University/,,,,1386-6346,1386-6346,9711801,Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,eng,10.1111/hepr.14219 [doi],20250616,,2025/06/16 12:27,,,,adjuvant; hepatocellular carcinoma; high‐risk of recurrence; target trial emulation; transarterial chemoembolization,NOTNLM,NLM,,2025/05/27 00:00,2025/06/16 10:54,2025/06/16 12:27,2025/05/24 00:00 [revised],,2025/06/16 12:27,2025/03/28 00:00,Netherlands,,,aheadofprint,Journal Article,,,,Hepatol Res. 2025 Jun 16. doi: 10.1111/hepr.14219.,Publisher,Hepatol Res,Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization After Truly Curative Resection Does Not  Improve Survival of Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma at High Risk of Recurrence: A Target Trial Emulation Study.,,,,
39085869,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pooled analyses of previous randomized controlled  trials reported that antifibrotics improved survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but the results were only based on short-term outcome data from selected patients who met strict criteria. Observational studies/meta-analyses also suggested that antifibrotics improve survival, but these studies failed to control for immortal time bias that considerably exaggerates drug effects. Therefore, whether antifibrotics truly improve long-term survival in patients with IPF in the real world remains undetermined and requires external validity. METHODS: We used data from the Japanese National Claims Database to estimate the intention-to-treat effect of antifibrotics on mortality. To address immortal time bias, we employed models treating antifibrotic initiation as a time-dependent covariate and target trial emulation (TTE), both incorporating new-user designs for antifibrotics and treating lung transplantation as a competing event. RESULTS: Of 30,154 patients with IPF, 14,525 received antifibrotics. Multivariate Fine-Gray models with antifibrotic initiation as a time-dependent covariate revealed that compared with no treatment, nintedanib (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.89) and pirfenidone (aHR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93) were associated with reduced mortality. The TTE model also replicated the associations of nintedanib (aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.65-0.74) and pirfenidone (aHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.78-0.85) with reduced mortality. Subgroup analyses confirmed this association regardless of age, sex, and comorbidities, excluding certain subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale real-world analysis support the generalizability of the association between antifibrotics and improved survival in various IPF populations.","Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan. hozumi@hama-med.ac.jp.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Research Support Center, Shizuoka General Hospital, 4-27-1 Kita Ando Aoi-ku,  Shizuoka, 420-8527, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Hamamatsu University School  of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.; Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama Higashiku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan.",10.1186/s12931-024-02922-y [pii]; 2922 [pii]; 10.1186/s12931-024-02922-y [doi],Hozumi H; Miyashita K; Nakatani E; Inoue Y; Yasui H; Suzuki Y; Karayama M; Furuhashi K; Enomoto N; Fujisawa T; Inui N; Suda T,ORCID: 0000-0001-5439-1543,© 2024.

40114533,"Sustained melatonin supplement use may delay pubertal onset, but evidence is  limited. In the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, we assessed if melatonin use for 38 months affected the timing of pubertal onset in males (N=3,134) and menarche in females (N=4,424). Pubertal outcomes were parent-reported using the Pubertal Development Scale. We emulated sequential target trials to evaluate the effect of initiating and continuing melatonin supplement use. Findings were contrasted with comparisons of ever- to never-users and initiators to non-initiators using Cox models. In sequentially emulated trials with 1,037,709 person-months among males and 1,818,084 person-months among females, there were 1,872 and 3,377 instances of melatonin use initiation among 186 males and 333 females, respectively. Observational analogues of intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects from target trial emulation showed no difference in risk of pubertal onset in males (end-of-follow-up per-protocol RR=1.00, 95%CI=0.87,1.13) or menarche in females (RR=0.93, 95%CI=0.80,1.07). By contrast, Cox models suggested a delay in menarche among 335(7.74%) melatonin ever-users after adjustment for child, family, and neighborhood characteristics collected at the enrollment visit (HR=0.80, 95%CI=(0.69,0.94)). In large samples, rigorous causal analyses that aligned eligibility criteria with treatment initiation and adjusted for time-varying confounding showed no effect of melatonin supplement use on pubertal timing.","Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard T.H.

40223676,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:  This study introduces an innovative research design in  the field of orthopedics, using a target trial emulation approach. We aimed to assess the causal effects of total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared with nonoperative treatment in reducing patient-reported hip disability at 3 months in patients with osteoarthritis, using real-world data. METHODS:  We emulated a target trial using real-world data of 2 Dutch hospitals between April 2020 and January 2022. Patients diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis and eligible for primary THA were included in the study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, THA was often cancelled due to external factors (i.e., limited operating room capacity, or surgeon unavailable due to quarantine rules), resulting in an arbitrary allocation of patients to THA (n = 132) or non-THA (n = 60). We compared changes in hip disability, measured using the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Physical function Short form (HOOS-PS), between the THA group at 3 months postoperatively and the non-THA group at ≥3 months post waiting-list. Linear regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounders, was used to compare between-group differences. RESULTS:  THA showed preferable outcomes compared with non-THA, indicated by a difference of -33 points (95% confidence interval [CI] -37 to -28) on the HOOS-PS. Patients in the THA group demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in hip function, with a mean change of -27 points (CI -31 to -24), while the control group showed no improvement with a mean change of 7 points (CI 3-11) on the HOOS-PS. CONCLUSION:  THA significantly improves hip function in osteoarthritis patients, surpassing the outcomes observed in the non-surgery group.","Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG Hospital, Amsterdam;  Department of Orthopedics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden; Santeon Better Together Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) Program, Utrecht, the Netherlands. a.d.klaassen@olvg.nl.; Santeon Better Together Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) Program, Utrecht;  Department of Quality and Improvement, OLVG Hospital, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG Hospital, Amsterdam, the  Netherlands.; Santeon Better Together Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) Program, Utrecht;  Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Martini Hospital, Groningen, the Netherlands.; Santeon Better Together Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) Program, Utrecht;  Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Martini Hospital, Groningen, the Netherlands.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG Hospital, Amsterdam, the  Netherlands.; epartment of Orthopedics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden; Department of  Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  the Netherlands.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG Hospital, Amsterdam;  Department of Orthopedics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden; Santeon Better Together Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) Program, Utrecht, the Netherlands.",ActaO-96-43332 [pii]; 10.2340/17453674.2025.43332 [doi],Klaassen AD; Jorritsma W; Willigenburg NW; Gerritsma CLE; Ten Have BLEF; Moojen DJF; Gademan MGJ; Groenwold RHH; Poolman RW,ORCID: 0000-0002-8499-2814; ORCID: 0000-0002-6106-3385; ORCID: 0000-0003-3178-2247,,,,,,2025/04/14 05:23,20250414,20250414,2025 Apr 14,2025/04/14 06:23,,,"Klaassen, Amanda D; Jorritsma, Wiard; Willigenburg, Nienke W; Gerritsma, Carina L E; Ten Have, Bas L E F; Moojen, Dirk Jan F; Gademan, Maaike G J; Groenwold, Rolf H H; Poolman, Rudolf W",,,,,1745-3682,1745-3674,1745-3674,101231512,Acta orthopaedica,eng,10.2340/17453674.2025.43332 [doi],20250416,"Humans; *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; *Osteoarthritis, Hip/surgery/therapy/physiopathology; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Aged; Treatment Outcome; COVID-19/epidemiology; Netherlands",2025/04/14 06:24,,,,,,NLM,310-316,,2025/04/14 05:23,2025/04/14 06:24,,2025/04/14 00:00,2025/04/14 06:23,2024/07/25 00:00,Sweden,PMC11995426,2025/04/14,epublish,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Multicenter Study,,IM,,Acta Orthop. 2025 Apr 14;96:310-316. doi: 10.2340/17453674.2025.43332.,MEDLINE,Acta Orthop,Effectiveness of total hip arthroplasty versus non-surgery on patient-reported  hip function at 3 months: a target trial emulation study of patients with osteoarthritis.,,,,96
39490317,"OBJECTIVES: Target trial emulation is a framework for conducting causal inference  using observational data. We employ this framework to estimate the effect of changing planned participation duration, measured using the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR), on injury risk among adolescent ice hockey players without recent injuries. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study designed to emulate a hypothetical randomized trial. METHODS: We used data from a 5-year cohort study (2013-2018) of ice hockey players aged 13-17 years in Alberta and British Columbia. We estimated injury risks associated with different planned changes in hockey participation duration (e.g. half [ACWR = 0.5], no change [ACWR = 1], two-fold [ACWR = 2], three-fold [ACWR = 3], and five-fold [ACWR = 5]) relative to participation in the previous 4 weeks. Outcomes were modeled using generalized additive models. We conducted secondary analyses restricted to concussions, and stratified by league bodychecking status. RESULTS: There were 2633 eligible participants, contributing 115,821 player-trials. Injury risk was 1.9 % (95 % CI: 1.7 %-2.3 %) for no change in participation (ACWR = 1). Injury risk ratios (RRs) were 0.43 at ACWR = 0.5 (95 % CI: 0.31-0.54), 1.62 (95 % CI: 1.33-1.98) at ACWR = 2, 1.91 at ACWR = 3 (95 % CI: 1.52-2.48) and 2.35 at ACWR = 5 (95 % CI: 1.68-3.26). Patterns were similar by league bodychecking status. Concussion RRs were stable between ACWR = 1 and 1.5, but RRs were greater than for any injury past ACWR = 2. CONCLUSIONS: Within the assumptions of this target trial emulation, injury risk increases consistently (no sweet spots) for increases in planned changes in participation duration relative to the previous 4 weeks among adolescent ice hockey players without recent injuries. Injuries in injury risk are less than expected for the increased exposure time at risk, suggesting beneficial effects of increasing participation that partially counteract the increased exposure time.","Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  McGill University, Canada; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill University, Canada.; Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of  Calgary, Canada.; Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of  Calgary, Canada.; Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of  Calgary, Canada.; Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  McGill University, Canada; Department of Family Medicine, McGill University, Canada.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, McGill University, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill University, Canada.; Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  McGill University, Canada; Department of Family Medicine, McGill University, Canada.

40620728,"BACKGROUND: The pivotal trial on venetoclax and hypomethylating agents in unfit  elderly acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has got FDA approval. However, Asian patients were under-represented and showed no survival advantage. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare overall survival and healthcare resource utilisation in elderly patients newly diagnosed with AML, receiving venetoclax with hypomethylating agents versus hypomethylating agents alone. DESIGN: Target trial emulation. METHODS: Propensity score matching balanced the baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression compared overall survival. Negative binomial regression assessed healthcare resource utilisation with time offset. RESULTS: Venetoclax plus hypomethylating agents treatment conferred superior overall survival in patients with AML ⩾60 years old and significantly reduced transfusion requirement compared to those receiving hypomethylating agents alone. The difference was particularly prominent among patients ⩾75 years old. CONCLUSION: Compared to hypomethylating agent alone, venetoclax plus hypomethylating agent benefits elderly patients with AML on overall survival and healthcare resource utilisation.","Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of  Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of  Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Sir Y.K.

40232782,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the causal effect of: (a) women's exposure  to intimate partner relationship strain during early young adulthood (ages 19-20) on self-rated general health at ages 23-28 and during pregnancy (32 weeks' gestation) and (b) women's exposure to relationship strain during early young adulthood and pregnancy on caregiver-reported 12-month-old offspring general health. To strengthen our causal inferences using observational data, we applied a target trial emulation framework. METHOD: This study makes use of maternal and caregiver-reported self-report data spanning young adulthood (three waves) and the early perinatal period (two waves) obtained from a population-based subsample of mothers (N = 300) and their offspring (N = 521), participating in the Australian Temperament Project Generation 3. We estimated the effect (standardized mean difference [β]) using a G-computation procedure. RESULTS: We observed no evidence for an association between maternal relationship strain in early young adulthood and maternal and offspring health (β = -.14 to .00). However, exposure to elevated relationship strain in pregnancy reduced offspring's general health (β = -.29). Associations were strongest for patterns of persistent or time-limited elevated strain during pregnancy (β = -.34 and -.43, respectively), albeit with weaker evidence. CONCLUSION: Evidence for a causal effect of maternal exposure to relationship strain on lower offspring health was found. The results suggest that pregnancy may be a sensitive period for this intergenerational transmission. While the target trial emulation framework does not eliminate all possible biases, it strengthens causal inference and provides precedence for future research to further investigate these intergenerational transmission processes.

33200083,"To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world  implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home orders, and numerous studies aim to estimate their effects. Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. While these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. ""Target trial emulation"" emphasizes the need to carefully design a non-experimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement -- and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (""panel"") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design, which we refer to as ""policy trial emulation."" This is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each ""treatment cohort"" (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from panel methods -- with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics -- can help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging.","Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 357 Evans Hall,  Berkeley, CA 94720-3880.; Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 357 Evans Hall,  Berkeley, CA 94720-3880.; Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California, Berkeley, 2607 Hearst  Avenue, Room 309, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 624  N.

39774191,"While renal replacement therapy (RRT) allows for precise fluid management as well  as addressing electrolyte imbalances and the removal of other necessary compounds, its early initiation has not shown benefit in the general critically ill population. Moreover, the effects of early RRT initiation specifically in patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) also remain unclear. This retrospective study investigated adult patients who underwent VA-ECMO between April 2018 and March 2022 and used the clone-censor-weight method to emulate a hypothetical target trial and compare two groups: patients who initiated RRT within 2 days of VA-ECMO initiation (Early) and those who did not (Late). The primary outcomes were 28-day and 90-day hospital mortality analyzed by Cox proportional hazards models and the secondary outcome was 90-day RRT dependence by pooled logistic regression models. Inverse probability censoring weights were applied to adjust the models. A total of 2,513 VA-ECMO patients were cloned into both groups. The 28-day and 90-day mortalities were lower in the Early group (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.53-0.68] and 0.67 [0.61-0.75]). However, the early group experienced greater RRT dependence at 90 days than the late group (OR 2.58 [1.94-3.46]). In conclusion, early initiation of RRT (within 2 days of VA-ECMO) was associated with lower hospital mortality but with a higher likelihood of 90-day RRT dependence in adult patients on VA-ECMO.","Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Institute of Science Tokyo, 1-5-45  Yushima, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8510, Japan.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at  Birmingham, THT 647, 1720 2nd Avenue S, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.; Department of Health Policy and Informatics, Institute of Science Tokyo, 1-5-45  Yushima, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8510, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Informatics, Institute of Science Tokyo, 1-5-45  Yushima, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8510, Japan.; Department of Internal Medicine, Brookwood Baptist Health, 833 Princeton Avenue  SW, Birmingham, AL, 35211, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at  Birmingham, THT 647, 1720 2nd Avenue S, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at  Birmingham, THT 647, 1720 2nd Avenue S, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.; Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of  Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1900 University Blvd, Birmingham, AL, 35294, USA.; Department of Health Policy and Informatics, Institute of Science Tokyo, 1-5-45  Yushima, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8510, Japan.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at  Birmingham, THT 647, 1720 2nd Avenue S, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.; Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Institute of Science Tokyo, 1-5-45  Yushima, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8510, Japan. wakabayashi.ccm@tmd.ac.jp.",10.1038/s41598-025-85109-9 [pii]; 85109 [pii]; 10.1038/s41598-025-85109-9 [doi],Kubo T; Takeuchi T; Inoue N; Cama-Olivares A; Chandramohan D; Tolwani AJ; Wille KM; Fushimi K; Neyra JA; Wakabayashi K,,© 2025.

40297460,"Missing data, inaccuracies in medication lists, and recording delays in  electronic health records (EHR) are major limitations for target trial emulation (TTE), which uses EHR data to retrospectively emulate a clinical trial. EHR-based TTE relies on recorded data that proxy actual drug exposures and outcomes. While prior work has proposed various methods to improve EHR data quality, here we investigate the underutilized consideration that encounters with a primary care provider (PCP) may result in more accurate data in the EHR. Patients with a PCP within the EHR network being studied tend to have more encounters overall and a greater proportion of the types of encounters that yield comprehensive and up-to-date records. By contrasting data for patients with and without a PCP in the considered EHR network, we demonstrate how PCP status affects EHR data quality. Through a case study, we then empirically examine the impact on TTE of including a PCP status feature either in the propensity score and outcome models or as an eligibility criterion for cohort selection, versus ignoring it. Specifically, we compare the estimated effects of two first-line antidiabetic drug classes on the onset of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. We find that the estimated treatment effect is sensitive to the consideration of PCP status, particularly when used as an eligibility criterion. Our work suggests that further researching the role of PCP status may improve the design of pragmatic trials.","Massachusetts General Hospital, US.; Harvard Medical School, US.; Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Massachusetts Institute of Technology &  Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital & Harvard Medical School, US.; Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School, US.",2025.04.08.25325485 [pii]; 10.1101/2025.04.08.25325485 [doi],Sunog M; Magdamo C; Charpignon ML; Albers M,ORCID: 0000-0001-7855-3455,,,,,,2025/04/29 05:01,,20250410,2025 Apr 10,2025/04/29 06:26,,,"Sunog, Max; Magdamo, Colin; Charpignon, Marie-Laure; Albers, Mark",,R01 AG058063/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States,,,,,,101767986,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,eng,2025.04.08.25325485 [pii]; 10.1101/2025.04.08.25325485 [doi],20250505,,2025/04/29 06:27,,,,,,NLM,,,2025/04/29 05:01,2025/04/29 06:27,,2025/04/28 00:00,2025/04/29 06:26,,United States,PMC12036400,2025/04/28,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,medRxiv [Preprint]. 2025 Apr 10:2025.04.08.25325485. doi:  10.1101/2025.04.08.25325485.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,medRxiv,Investigating Primary Care Indications to Improve the Quality of Electronic  Health Record Data in Target Trial Emulation for Dementia.,,,,
40327162,"BACKGROUND: The role of radiation therapy in combination with systemic treatment  for stage IVb esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unclear. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of primary chemoradiotherapy for these patients and compare it to that chemotherapy alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we adopted a target trial emulation framework to identify eligible patients in the Taiwan Cancer Registry diagnosed between 2011 and 2021. In the primary analysis, overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint, whereas the incidence of esophageal cancer mortality was the secondary endpoint. Extensive supplementary analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: We included 5294 patients in the primary analysis and found that OS was significantly better for those treated with chemoradiotherapy (n = 5065) than for those treated with chemotherapy only (n = 229). The propensity score weighting adjusted hazard ratio of death was 0.46 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.52, p < 0.0001). The secondary endpoint and supplementary analyses also favored the chemoradiotherapy group. CONCLUSION: The OS of stage IVb ESCC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy was significantly better than that of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The results of relevant ongoing clinical trials are eagerly awaited.","Department of Radiation Oncology, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China  Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.; School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung,  Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung,  Taiwan, ROC.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, China Medical University, North  District, No. 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hsinchu Hospital,  Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, China Medical University, North  District, No. 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung,  Taiwan, ROC.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, China Medical University, North  District, No. 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung,  Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung,  Taiwan, ROC. d16181@gmail.com.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, China Medical University, North  District, No. 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan, ROC. d16181@gmail.com.",10.1007/s12672-025-02451-0 [pii]; 2451 [pii]; 10.1007/s12672-025-02451-0 [doi],Kuo YH; Lin CY; Wang YC; Lai YL; Kuo YC; Liang JA; Li CC; Chien CR,,© 2025.

39982723,"IMPORTANCE: The 2023 American College of Rheumatology and American Association of  Hip and Knee Surgeons Clinical Practice Guideline concluded that obesity alone should not delay joint replacement. Therefore, a substantially increased utilization of joint replacement among patients with obesity could be expected. However, patients with obesity are at increased risk of revision, posing unique challenges as the surgery is complex and costly, and it remains unknown whether postoperative weight loss could decrease the risk of revision. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of the proportion of postoperative weight loss following antiobesity medication use with the risk of revision among patients with obesity undergoing hip or knee replacement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a target trial emulation, a causal inference framework, this retrospective cohort study investigated patients with obesity who underwent hip or knee replacement. Data were from the IQVIA Medical Research Database (2000-2023). Statistical analysis was performed from October 2023 to June 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Emulated analyses of a hypothetical target trial were assessed for the association of small-to-moderate (2%-10%) or large (≥10%) weight loss after initiating antiobesity medications (orlistat, sibutramine, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and rimonabant) within 1 year with the risk of 5-year and 10-year revision after initiation of antiobesity medications. RESULTS: Among 3691 qualified participants (mean [SD] age, 64.7 [9.3] years; 2322 [62.9%] women), the 5-year risks of revision were 5.6%, 4.4%, and 3.7% for weight gain or stable, small-to-moderate weight loss, and large weight loss groups, respectively. Compared with the weight gain or stable group, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.55-1.04) for the small-to-moderate weight loss group and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.36-0.91) for the large weight loss group. Similar results were observed when the analyses were performed separately for hip or knee replacement. The HRs for revision were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.32-0.93) for small-to-moderate weight loss and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25-0.97) for large weight loss groups compared with the weight gain or stable group in patients undergoing knee replacement; the corresponding HRs for revision were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.54-1.25) and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.30-0.93) in patients undergoing hip replacement. Consistent findings were obtained regarding the association of weight loss with the 10-year risks after initiating antiobesity medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study using a target trial emulation, a higher proportion of weight loss after initiating antiobesity medications within 1 year was associated with a lower risk of 5-year and 10-year revision among patients with obesity undergoing joint replacement. These results suggest that antiobesity medication use, with relatively safe and sustainable weight loss, may be an effective strategy for improving implant survivorship of hip and knee replacements in the obese population.","Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha,  China.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Changsha, China.; Key Laboratory of Aging-related Bone and Joint Diseases Prevention and Treatment,  Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Orthopaedics, Clinical Epidemiology Unit,  Lund University, Lund, Sweden.; Center for Musculoskeletal Health and Department of Medicine, University of  California School of Medicine, Sacramento.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston.; The Mongan Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School,  Boston.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Changsha, China.; Key Laboratory of Aging-related Bone and Joint Diseases Prevention and Treatment,  Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha,  China.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Changsha, China.; Key Laboratory of Aging-related Bone and Joint Diseases Prevention and Treatment,  Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Xiangya School of Public  Health, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha,  China.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Changsha, China.; Key Laboratory of Aging-related Bone and Joint Diseases Prevention and Treatment,  Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha,  China.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Joint Degeneration and Injury, Changsha, China.; Key Laboratory of Aging-related Bone and Joint Diseases Prevention and Treatment,  Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University, Changsha, China.",2830593 [pii]; zoi241703 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.61200 [doi],Xie D; Englund M; Lane NE; Zhang Y; Li X; Wei J; Zeng C; Lei G,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Englund reported personal fees from  Grunenthal Sweden AB and personal fees from Key2Compliance AB outside the submitted work.

40651934,"OBJECTIVES: To compare osteoarthritis among individuals with osteoporosis  initiating romosozumab vs an active comparator. METHODS: This new user comparative effectiveness study, emulating a target trial, included individuals aged ≥50 years in the administrative claims database from 2019 to 2022. Individuals who initiated romosozumab were compared with those who initiated teriparatide. The primary outcome was the incidence of osteoarthritis, while secondary outcomes included joint-specific osteoarthritis (knee, hip, and hand) at 1 year. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to balance baseline characteristics between romosozumab and teriparatide users, and inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) was employed to account for informative censoring. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk (RR) at 1 year were estimated using a weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: A total of 22,145 individuals were included in the study (87% female; mean age, 80 years). After IPTW-IPCW adjustment, romosozumab was associated with a lower risk of osteoarthritis compared with teriparatide (ARR, 1.1% [95% CI, 0.5%-1.8%]; RR, 0.79 [0.66, 0.89]). Joint-specific analyses showed the following results: knee osteoarthritis: ARR, 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.5%), RR, 0.79 (0.66, 0.92); hip osteoarthritis: ARR, 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0%-0.5%), RR, 0.68 (0.37, 1.05); and hand osteoarthritis: ARR, 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0%-0.4%), RR, 0.61 (0.35, 1.06). CONCLUSIONS: Romosozumab was associated with a lower risk of osteoarthritis than teriparatide among individuals with osteoporosis, particularly for knee osteoarthritis. Similar trends were observed for hip and hand osteoarthritis; however, the differences were not significant.","Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Health Economics, School of Public  Health, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

39384578,"BACKGROUND: Post hoc analyses of clinical trials suggest that sodium-glucose  cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) lower the risk of hyperkalemia and facilitate the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) in people with type 2 diabetes. Whether this is also observed in routine care is unclear. We investigated whether SGLT-2i lowered the risk of hyperkalemia and RASi discontinuation as compared to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i). METHODS: Using the target trial emulation framework, we studied adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who started SGLT-2i or DPP-4i in Stockholm, Sweden (2014-2021). The outcomes were incident hyperkalemia (potassium >5.0 mmol/l), mild hyperkalemia (potassium >5-≤5.5 mmol/l), and moderate to severe hyperkalemia (potassium >5.5 mmol/l). Among RASi users, we studied time to RASi discontinuation through evaluation of pharmacy fills. Cox regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to estimate per-protocol hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: In total, 29 849 individuals (15 326 SGLT-2i and 14 523 DPP-4i initiators) were included (mean age 66 years, 37% women). About one-third of participants in each arm discontinued treatment within 1 year. Compared with DPP-4i, SGLT-2i use was associated with a lower rate of hyperkalemia (HR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.64-0.93), including both mild (0.76; 0.62-0.93) and moderate/severe (0.53; 0.40-0.69) hyperkalemia events. Of 19 116 participants who used RASi at baseline, 7% discontinued therapy. Initiation of SGLT-2i vs. DPP-4i was not associated with the rate of RASi discontinuation (0.97; 0.83-1.14). Results were consistent in intention-to-treat analysis and across strata of sex, cardiovascular disease, use of MRA, and use of RASi. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetes managed in routine clinical care, the use of SGLT-2i was associated with lower rates of hyperkalemia compared with DPP-4i. Possibly because of a relatively high rate of treatment discontinuations, this was not accompanied by higher persistence on RASi therapy.","Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, Peking University,  Beijing, China.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and  Population Health, INSERM U1018, Paris-Saclay University, Paris, France.; Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, Peking University,  Beijing, China.; Department of Renal Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  Baltimore, USA.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet,  Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.",7816378 [pii]; gfae227 [pii]; 10.1093/ndt/gfae227 [doi],Bosi A; Xu Y; Faucon AL; Huang T; Evans M; Shin JI; Fu EL; Carrero JJ,ORCID: 0000-0002-1074-608X; ORCID: 0000-0001-6716-1157; ORCID: 0000-0001-8650-5795; ORCID: 0000-0003-0374-6927; ORCID: 0000-0002-9698-6825; ORCID: 0000-0003-4763-2024,© The Author(s) 2024.

40462309,"Prostate cancer and its treatment can impact health-related quality of life.  Evidence for physical activity strategies sustained over long periods to improve quality of life is limited. Given the limited feasibility of a randomized trial to answer this question, we emulated a target trial of physical activity strategies based on current clinical guidelines and 6-year quality of life using observational data from 1,549 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 2004-2016. Eligible individuals were free of conditions that may preclude high levels of physical activity at baseline. We estimated 6-year mean physical quality of life scores (based on EPIC-CP symptom domains; range: 1-12, lower is better) under sustained, dynamic physical activity strategies, adjusting for baseline and time-varying variables using the parametric g-formula. Estimated 6-year mean differences (adherence to physical activity recommendations vs. non-adherence) were 0.1 (95% confidence interval: 0.0,0.2) for bowel symptoms, -0.1 (-0.2,0.1) for urinary incontinence, 0.0 (-0.1,0.2) for urinary irritation/obstruction, -0.3 (-0.7,0.1) for sexual symptoms, and -0.1 (-0.2,0.1) for vitality/hormonal symptoms. Estimated 6-year mean differences comparing adherence to physical activity recommendations vs. no intervention (observed physical activity in this population) were close to zero. Adhering to current physical activity recommendations may help to improve 6-year symptoms in the sexual domain, with little expected influence on symptoms in the bowel, urinary, and vitality/hormonal domains.","Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.

40231086,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia linked to an  elevated risk of stroke and dementia. Emerging observational evidence suggests that left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) may reduce the risk of dementia in patients with AF; however, further research is required to confirm this potential benefit. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of LAAO vs direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in reducing the risk of dementia in patients with AF. METHODS: We conducted target trial emulation using data from the TriNetX research network. Patients with AF were allocated to 2 cohorts (2270 patients in each one), treated either with LAAO or with DOACs, and balanced with propensity score matching. The primary end points were composite dementia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer disease. Secondary end points included mortality, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and major adverse cardiovascular events. Follow-up was conducted over 3 years. RESULTS: At 3-year follow-up, the risk of composite dementia was lower in the LAAO group than in the DOAC group (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.85). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent results, favoring the LAAO group. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: This real-world study suggests that LAAO is associated with a lower risk of dementia in patients with AF compared with DOACs. Further prospective research with long-term follow-up is needed to validate our findings in the population with AF.","Department of Neurology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Neurology, Tainan Sin Lau Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Neurology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, National Sun Yat-sen University,  Kaohsiung, Taiwan.; Department of Internal Medicine, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Neurology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.",S2666-5018(24)00381-7 [pii]; 10.1016/j.hroo.2024.11.012 [doi],Lu KH; Hsieh CY; Hsiang-Te Tsai D; Chia-Cheng Lai E; Hsieh MT; Hsu WH; Lin KH,,© 2024 Heart Rhythm Society.

40366892,"AIMS: There is conflicting trial evidence on the comparative effects of dual  antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel in older patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). We aimed to assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major bleeding in ACS patients ≥75 years initiating ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used healthcare data from the Stockholm region (2011-2021) to emulate a hypothetical target trial comparing ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel. MACE was defined as composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke. Patients were followed for 12 months. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for 46 baseline confounders. We used weighted Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the weighted Aalen-Johansen estimator to estimate absolute risks (AR).Among 4,637 older patients (median age 81 years [IQR 77-85]), 49% initiated DAPT with ticagrelor and 51% with clopidogrel. After weighting, all confounders were balanced. Ticagrelor was associated with a lower one-year MACE risk than clopidogrel (11.1% vs. 14.9%), corresponding to an AR difference of -3.8% (95%CI -6.8, -0.8). The HR for ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel was 0.73 (95%CI 0.56-0.95). There was no difference in the risk of major bleeding with one-year ARs of 4.3% with ticagrelor vs. 4.8% with clopidogrel, and a HR of 0.89 (95%CI 0.63-1.27).

40514059,"OBJECTIVE: Relationships between patient education and long-term clinical  outcomes are complex. This study used real-world data to evaluate the impact of improved pain knowledge on clinical outcomes in fibromyalgia patients. METHODS: Prospectively collected registry-based observational data were analysed to emulate a randomised clinical trial. Study participants were diagnosed with fibromyalgia, had a high need to learn about pain (Numeric Rating Scale >7), had attended a 2-day therapeutic educational programme and re-rated their learning needs after the programme. A good educational outcome was defined as a re-rating score <5, while a poor outcome was ≥5. The primary endpoint at 9 months was the overall impact of fibromyalgia, measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR) impact subscale. RESULTS: The eligible cohort comprised 450 participants. The intention-to-treat from population included 121 participants (26.9%) with a good educational outcome and 329 participants (73.1%) with a poor educational outcome (comparator group). Missing outcome data were handled implicitly by the repeated measures linear mixed models, assuming data are missing at random.At the 9-month endpoint, the fully adjusted FIQR impact subscale score was lower in the good educational outcome group (8.0 (95% CI 7.3 to 8.7)) compared with the poor educational outcome group (9.6 (95% CI 9.0 to 10.2)), indicating a better clinical outcome for those with a good educational outcome. The model-estimated between-group difference was -1.6 (95% CI -2.5 to -0.7; p=0.0006) FIQR impact subscale units. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that achieving pain educational learning objectives leads to better clinical outcomes in fibromyalgia patients, supporting the integration of pain education into patient programmes.","The Parker Institute, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and  Frederiksberg, Frederiksberg, Denmark kirstine.amris@regionh.dk.; Department of Rheumatology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and  Frederiksberg, Frederiksberg, Denmark.; The Parker Institute, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and  Frederiksberg, Frederiksberg, Denmark.; Research Unit of Rheumatology, Department of Clinical Research, University of  Southern Denmark, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.; The Parker Institute, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and  Frederiksberg, Frederiksberg, Denmark.; User perspectives and community-based interventions, Department of Public Health,  University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.; The Parker Institute, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and  Frederiksberg, Frederiksberg, Denmark.; Department of Rheumatology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and  Frederiksberg, Frederiksberg, Denmark.; The Parker Institute, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and  Frederiksberg, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",rmdopen-2025-005576 [pii]; 10.1136/rmdopen-2025-005576 [doi],Amris K; Christensen R; Wæhrens EE; Duhn PH; Henriksen M,ORCID: 0000-0003-0792-505X,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

40493151,"OBJECTIVE: This study complements evidence from randomized controlled trials on  the harms (e.g., hypoglycemia) of sulfonylureas compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in older adults using real-world data. Existing evidence suggests an increased risk of hypoglycemia, falls, fractures, and cardiovascular events. METHODS: Using target trial emulation, we analyzed a retrospective cohort drawn from German routine claims data. We included patients older than 65 years who initiated DPP4i (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, or saxagliptin) or sulfonylureas (glibenclamid or glimepirid) as add on to metformin between 2011 and 2018. Confounding was adjusted for through overlap weighting, and the average treatment effects were estimated in the overlap population using generalized linear models. RESULTS: Among 171,318 eligible patients, 111,865 (65%) received DPP4i and 59,453 (35%) sulfonylureas. Patients treated with DPP4i had a higher prevalence of all observed comorbidities. Applying overlap weights to adjust for confounding, patients treated with DPP4i had a higher rate of combined all-cause hospitalizations and outpatient visits compared with those treated with sulfonylureas (rate ratio = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.03) in the total population. In contrast, we found a protective effect of DPP4i on the risk for severe hypoglycemia in the subgroups of new users (ratio rate (RR) = 0.51, 95% CI 0.33, 0.76) and patients with severe renal insufficiency (RR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.16, 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Deprescribing sulfonylureas and using DPP4i instead may slightly reduce harm in some subgroups of older adults, which supports recommendations of existing lists of potentially inappropriate medications.","Department of Medical Statistics, University Medical Center Göttingen, Göttingen,  Germany. paula.starke@med.uni-goettingen.de.; Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Health, University of Witten/Herdecke, Witten,  Germany.; aQua-Institut GmbH, Göttingen, Germany.; Department of Medical Statistics, University Medical Center Göttingen, Göttingen,  Germany.; Department of Medical Statistics, University Medical Center Göttingen, Göttingen,  Germany.",10.1007/s40266-025-01218-0 [pii]; 1218 [pii]; 10.1007/s40266-025-01218-0 [doi],Starke P; Thürmann P; Grobe T; Friede T; Mathes T,ORCID: 0000-0001-7710-4068,© 2025.

40220505,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of fungal colonization and infection phenotypes  and other prognostic factors on in-hospital mortality among mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (n = 376) admitted to ICUs during the first wave of the pandemic in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A target trial emulation framework was used to minimize immortal time bias. Patients were matched 1:1:2 for age and gender and classified into three groups: 94 in the ""Early"" group (fungal colonization or infection within 10 days), 94 in the ""Late"" group (10-30 days), and 188 in the ""No"" group (no fungal colonization or infection within 30 days). In-hospital mortality and clinical outcomes were compared across groups. RESULTS: Patients in the ""Early"" group received higher cumulative corticosteroid doses, had lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios, and exhibited higher rates of comorbidities, cytomegalovirus viremia, and lung, heart, and kidney complications. They also had a longer duration of ventilator use, ICU stay, and total hospitalization compared to the ""Late"" and ""No"" groups. Time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the ""Early"" phenotype as a strong predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]= 3.992, 95 % CI: 2.676-5.956, p < 0.001). Additional independent risk factors included Charlson Comorbidity Index (aHR = 1.213, 95 % CI: 1.113-1.323, p < 0.001) and APACHE II score (aHR = 1.028, 95 % CI: 1.011-1.045, p = 0.001). In contrast, higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios (aHR = 0.998, 95 % CI: 0.997-1.000, p = 0.021) and ganciclovir use (aHR = 0.419, 95 % CI: 0.245-0.717, p = 0.002) were associated with reduced mortality. CONCLUSIONS: ""Early"" fungal colonization and infection within 10 days of corticosteroid initiation is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Future research should explore early intervention strategies, including antifungal prophylaxis, optimized corticosteroid dosing, and immune modulation, to improve survival outcomes.","Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, 289 Jianguo Rd, Xindian Dist., New Taipei 231, Taiwan; School of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, No. 701, Section 3, Chung Yang Road, Hualien 970, Taiwan.; Department of Nursing, College of Nursing, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung  University, No. 155, Section 2, Linong Street, Taipei City 112, Taiwan.; Department of Chest Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, No. 201, Section  2, Shih-Pai Road, Taipei 112, Taiwan; Institute of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, No. 155, Section 2, Linong Street, Taipei 112, Taiwan; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, No. 155, Section 2, Linong Street, Taipei 112, Taiwan.; Department of Chest Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, No. 201, Section  2, Shih-Pai Road, Taipei 112, Taiwan; Institute of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, No. 155, Section 2, Linong Street, Taipei 112, Taiwan; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, No. 155, Section 2, Linong Street, Taipei 112, Taiwan; Cancer Progression Research Center, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, No. 155, Section 2, Linong Street, Taipei 112, Taiwan.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, 289 Jianguo Rd, Xindian Dist., New Taipei 231, Taiwan.; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, No. 21,  Section 2, Nanya South Road, Banqiao, New Taipei City 220, Taiwan; Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan Ze University, 135 Yuan-Tung Road, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, School of  Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, 252, Wu-xing St., Taipei 110, Taiwan; Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, No. 291, Zhongzheng Rd., Zhonghe District, New Taipei 235, Taiwan.; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, School of  Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, 252, Wu-xing St., Taipei 110, Taiwan; Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, No. 291, Zhongzheng Rd., Zhonghe District, New Taipei 235, Taiwan.; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College  of Medicine, No. 7, Chung Shan S.

However, the benefits of vaccination in these age groups with prior infection remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing reinfection with various Omicron subvariants (BA.1/2, BA.4/5, XBB, and later) among 5- to 17-year-olds with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: A target trial emulation through nested designs with distinct study periods. SETTING: The study utilized data from the Research COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) initiative, a national electronic health record (EHR) database comprising 37 U.S. children's hospitals and health institutions. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 5-17 years with a documented history of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the study start date during a specific variant-dominant period (Delta, BA.1/2, or BA.4/5) who received a subsequent dose of COVID-19 vaccine during the study periods were compared with those with a documented history of infection who did not receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during the study period. Those infected within the Delta-Omicron composite period (December 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021) were excluded. The study period was from January 1, 2022, to August 30, 2023, and focused on adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and children aged 5 to 11 years. EXPOSURES: At least received one COVID-19 vaccination during the study period vs. no receipt of any COVID-19 vaccine during the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome is documented SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during the study period (both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases). The effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine was estimated as (1- hazard ratio) *100%, with confounders adjusted by a combination of propensity score matching and exact matching. RESULTS: The study analyzed 87,573 participants during the BA.1/2 period, 229,326 during the BA.4/5 period, and 282,981 during the XBB or later period. Among vaccinated individuals, significant protection was observed during the BA.1/2 period, with effectiveness rates of 62% (95% CI: 38%-77%) for children and 65% (95% CI: 32%-81%) for adolescents. During the BA.4/5 period, vaccine effectiveness was 57% (95% CI: 25%-76%) for children, but not statistically significant for adolescents (36%, 95% CI: -16%-65%). For the XBB period, no significant protection was observed in either group, with effectiveness rates of 22% (95% CI: -36%-56%) in children and 34% (95% CI: -10%-61%) in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: COVID-19 vaccination provides significant protection against reinfection for children and adolescents with prior infections during the early and mid-Omicron periods. This study also highlights the importance of addressing low vaccination rates in pediatric populations to enhance protection against emerging variants.","The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, University of Pittsburgh,  Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Graduate Group in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, School of  Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh School of  Medicine, Pittsburg, PA, USA.; University Medical Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, USA.; Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY,  USA.; Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, The University of Iowa,  Iowa City, IA, USA.; Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development, Seattle Children's Research  Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.; Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health, Department of Immunology, School of  Biomedical Sciences, UT Southwestern Medical Center; Dallas, TX, USA.; College of Nursing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics and Center for Biostatistics, Ohio State  University, Columbus, OH, USA.; Center for Outcomes Research, Ochsner Health, New Orleans, LA, USA.; Nicklaus Children's Hospital, Miami, FL, USA.; Program for Maternal Health Equity, Center for Urban Bioethics, Department of  Population Health and Urban Bioethics, Center for Obesity Research and Education, College of Public Health, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.; Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,  New York, NY, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics, University of Florida,  College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA.; University of California, San Francisco, Division of Rheumatology, Benioff  Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Biostatistics, and Medical Epidemiology,  University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, MO, USA.; Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Nationwide  Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Penn State Health Milton  S.

40397442,"IMPORTANCE: Serious bacterial infections such as bacteremia, endocarditis,  osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis typically require prolonged intravenous antibiotics. Long-acting lipoglycopeptides (laLGPs), such as dalbavancin and oritavancin, offer extended treatment intervals for gram-positive infections that may benefit populations with barriers to traditional treatment, including persons who use drugs (PWUD individuals). OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of laLGPs in managing serious bacterial infections in both PWUD and non-PWUD populations compared with standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study using a target trial emulation framework included data extracted from the US Cerner Real World Data platform. Individuals hospitalized and discharged for serious bacterial infections between October 1, 2015, and October 1, 2022, were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from July 7, 2023, to February 28, 2025. INTERVENTION: Receipt of an laLGP (dalbavancin or oritavancin) vs SOC antibiotics. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was a composite of readmission, emergency department visit, and inpatient death or discharge to hospice within 90 days post discharge from the index admission. Analyses were stratified by PWUD and non-PWUD status. Clone censor weighting was used to emulate a per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) of time to the composite event and 95% CIs were calculated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Among 42 067 included individuals, median age was 61 (IQR, 47-73) years, 24 704 were male (58.7%), and 5047 (12.0%) were classified as PWUD. laLGPs were prescribed in 825 individuals (2.0%). There was no statistically significant difference in the composite outcome between the laLGP and SOC groups in both the PWUD (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88-1.13) and non-PWUD (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86-1.00) participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of laLGPs vs SOC, findings suggested that laLGPs were effective as step-down treatment of serious gram-positive bacterial infections, offering comparable outcomes to those of SOC antibiotics in PWUD and non-PWUD individuals. Clinicians may consider laLGPs as alternative step-down options to SOC antibiotics for the treatment of serious gram-positive bacterial infections.","Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia.; Division of Infectious Diseases, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA  (University of California, Los Angeles), Los Angeles.; UCLA Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services, Los  Angeles.; Department of Biostatistics, Fielding School of Public Health, UCLA, Los Angeles.; Division of Infectious Diseases, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA  (University of California, Los Angeles), Los Angeles.; Medical Imaging Informatics Group, Department of Radiological Sciences, UCLA, Los  Angeles.; Division of Infectious Diseases, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA  (University of California, Los Angeles), Los Angeles.; Division of Infectious Diseases, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA  (University of California, Los Angeles), Los Angeles.; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia.; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia.",2834350 [pii]; zoi250396 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.11641 [doi],Goodman-Meza D; Weiss RE; Poimboeuf ML; Feng J; Vijayan T; Martinello M; Matthews GV; Dore GJ,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Martinello reported receiving personal fees  from AbbVie Inc outside the submitted work.

34196082,"AIMS: Whether to continue or stop mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)  after an episode of hyperkalaemia is a challenge in clinical practice. While stopping MRA may prevent recurrent hyperkalaemias, it deprives patients of their cardioprotection. We here assessed the association between stopping vs. continuing MRA therapy after hyperkalaemia and the subsequent risks of adverse health events. METHODS AND RESULTS: Observational study from the Stockholm CREAtinine Measurements (SCREAM) project 2006-2018. We identified patients initiating MRA and surviving a first-detected episode of hyperkalaemia (plasma potassium >5.0 mmol/L). Using target trial emulation methods, we assessed the association between stopping vs. continuing MRA within 6 months after hyperkalaemia and subsequent outcomes. The primary outcome was the composite of hospital admission with heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. The secondary outcome was occurrence of another hyperkalaemia event. Among 39 518 patients initiating MRA, we identified 7366 who developed hyperkalaemia. Median age was 76 years, 45% were women and 69% had a history of heart failure. Following hyperkalaemia, 2222 (30%) discontinued treatment. Compared with continuing MRA, stopping therapy was associated with a lower 2-year risk of recurrent hyperkalaemia [hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.79], but a higher risk of the primary outcome (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14). Similar results were observed in patients with heart failure, after censoring when treatment decision was changed, and across pre-specified subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping MRA after an episode of hyperkalaemia was associated with reduced risk for recurrent hyperkalaemia, but higher risk of death or cardiovascular events. Recurrent hyperkalaemia was common in either strategy.","Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Heart and Vascular Theme, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  The Netherlands.; Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Heart and Vascular Theme, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.; Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster University,  Hamilton, Canada.; Department of Medicine, St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, Canada.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.",10.1002/ejhf.2287 [doi],Trevisan M; Fu EL; Xu Y; Savarese G; Dekker FW; Lund LH; Clase CM; Sjölander A; Carrero JJ,,© 2021 European Society of Cardiology.,Eur J Heart Fail. 2021 Oct;23(10):1708-1711. doi: 10.1002/ejhf.2331.

40423066,"Background: Target trial emulation involves the application of design principles  from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to observational data, and is particularly useful in situations where an RCT would be unfeasible. Biomarker-guided trials, which incorporate biomarkers within their design to either guide treatment and/or determine eligibility, are often unfeasible in practice due to sample size requirements or ethical concerns. Here, we undertake a systematic review of methodologies used in target trial emulations, comparing treatment effectiveness, critically appraising them, and considering their applicability to the emulation of biomarker-guided trials. Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was developed to identify studies reporting on methods for target trial emulation comparing the effectiveness of treatments using observational data, and applied to the following bibliographic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Ovid MEDLINE. A narrative description of methods identified in the review was undertaken alongside a critique of their relative strengths and limitations. Results: We identified a total of 59 papers: 47 emulating a target trial ('application' studies), and 12 detailing methods to emulate a target trial ('methods' studies). A total of 25 papers were identified as emulating a biomarker-guided trial (42%). While all papers reported methods to adjust for baseline confounding, 40% of application papers did not specify methods to adjust for time-varying confounding. Conclusions: This systematic review has identified a range of methods used to control for baseline, time-varying, and residual/unmeasured confounding within target trial emulation and provides a guide for researchers interested in emulation of biomarker-guided trials.","Department of Health Data Science, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GL,  UK.; Department of Public Health, Policy and Systems, University of Liverpool,  Liverpool L69 3GL, UK.; Department of Health Data Science, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GL,  UK.; Department of Health Data Science, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GL,  UK.",jpm15050195 [pii]; jpm-15-00195 [pii]; 10.3390/jpm15050195 [doi],Baldwin FD; Khalaf RKS; Kolamunnage-Dona R; Jorgensen AL,ORCID: 0000-0002-9425-791X; ORCID: 0000-0002-7666-0617,,,,"The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

40332932,"IMPORTANCE: Guidelines for resectable locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC)  advocate for neoadjuvant radiotherapy (NRT) followed by surgery as the standard approach. However, recent trials have reported no oncological benefits of NRT-based therapy for middle or lower rectal cancer, raising the question of whether NRT followed by surgery remains the optimal treatment approach for resectable LARC overall. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of NRT followed by surgery vs up-front surgery for resectable LARC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study, using a target trial emulation framework with nationwide registries in Taiwan, included patients undergoing curative resection for resectable LARC (cT1-2N1-2, cT3Nany) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017, with follow-up until December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2024, to February 15, 2025. EXPOSURE: NRT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and local recurrence (LR). The secondary outcome was intraoperative diverting stoma outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 4099 patients were analyzed, including 1436 patients undergoing NRT followed by surgery (median [IQR] age, 62.0 [53.0-71.0] years; 1036 [72.1%] male) and 2663 patients undergoing up-front surgery (median [IQR] age, 65.0 [56.0-74.0] years; 1626 [61.1%] male). NRT followed by surgery, compared with up-front surgery, was associated with higher 3-year OS rates (88.5% vs 85.2%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.92) but higher permanent diverting stoma rates (20.6% vs 11.1%; relative risk [RR], 1.91; 95% CI, 1.62-2.25); LR rates were not significantly different (5.7% vs 6.6%; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.55-1.11). Subgroup analysis revealed that compared with up-front surgery, NRT followed by surgery was associated with improved outcomes in middle or lower rectal cancer but not upper rectal cancer (OS: HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.82-2.90; LR: HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.23-5.00). NRT followed by surgery was associated with significantly increased risks of permanent diverting stomas across different tumor heights, particularly in upper rectal cancer (RR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.44-8.69). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of nationwide registries in Taiwan, NRT followed by surgery was associated with improved oncological outcomes for overall resectable LARC, with excessive diverting stoma nonreversal as the trade-off. However, the benefits of NRT were not observed for upper rectal cancer. These findings raise concerns about potential harm from NRT and advise caution when performing NRT for upper rectal cancer.","Department of Surgery, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell  Medicine, New York, New York.; Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Oncology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville,  Tennessee.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Surgery, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville,  Tennessee.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National  Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.",2833615 [pii]; zoi250330 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.9049 [doi],Chen PC; Yang AS; Fichera A; Tsai MH; Wu YH; Yeh YM; Shyr Y; Lai EC; Lai CH,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.,,2025/05/07 11:37,20250507,20250501,2025 May 1,2025/05/07 12:31,,,"Chen, Po-Chuan; Yang, Avery Shuei-He; Fichera, Alessandro; Tsai, Mu-Hung; Wu, Yuan-Hua; Yeh, Yu-Min; Shyr, Yu; Lai, Edward Chia-Cheng; Lai, Chao-Han",,,5,,2574-3805,2574-3805,,101729235,JAMA network open,eng,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.9049 [doi]; e259049,20250510,"Humans; *Rectal Neoplasms/surgery/radiotherapy/mortality/therapy; Male; Female; Middle Aged; *Neoadjuvant Therapy/methods; Aged; Taiwan/epidemiology; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology; Cohort Studies; Treatment Outcome; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant",2025/05/07 12:32,,,,,,NLM,e259049,,2025/05/07 11:37,2025/05/07 12:32,,2025/05/07 00:00,2025/05/07 12:31,,United States,PMC12059978,2025/05/07,epublish,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,IM,,JAMA Netw Open. 2025 May 1;8(5):e259049. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.9049.,MEDLINE,JAMA Netw Open,Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy vs Up-Front Surgery for Resectable Locally Advanced  Rectal Cancer.,,,,8
40695705,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The prognosis after distant metastasis of breast cancer  is generally poor. We analyzed the effect of an autologous formalin-fixed tumor vaccine (AFTV) on postoperative breast cancer using 35-year follow-up real-world data in a concurrent cohort and a target trial emulation, a similar method to the randomized study. The sample (n = 698) was narrowed to cases with distant metastasis, resulting in a cohort of 94 patients. In this study, meta-OS refers to overall survival after distant metastasis. RESULTS: Treatment with AFTV significantly prolonged meta-OS. The median meta-OS was 4.58 years for the AFTV group (n = 59) compared to 2.81 years for the control group (n = 35), with a significant difference (P = .0300). Radiotherapy (RT), a stratified factor, also extended meta-OS, although no superiority was observed between AFTV therapy and RT in multivariable regression analysis. The combination of AFTV therapy and RT demonstrated a synergistic effect in prolonging meta-OS (P = .0320). Chemotherapy (Chemo) alone showed no significant effect on meta-OS in the control group but shortened meta-OS in the AFTV group, if administered within 6 months of AFTV treatment (P = .0478). Treating after distant metastasis, the ""Optimum AFTV Set"" subgroup (AFTV therapy plus RT without Chemo within 6 months, n = 13) extracted from the AFTV group had a median meta-OS of 12.85 years, showing a significant improvement compared to the corresponding control subgroup (RT without Chemo within 6 months) (n = 6, P = .00819). The 10-year survival rate after distant metastasis was 25.6% in the AFTV group, 7.4% in the control group, 53.8% in the Optimum AFTV Set subgroup, and 0% in the corresponding control subgroup. All AFTV-related adverse events were classified as CTCAE grade 2 or lower. DISCUSSION: The results of Optimum AFTV Set therapy provide a strong rationale for a larger-scale prospective randomized study. CONCLUSION: The present real-world data suggest that Optimum AFTV Set therapy may be a useful option for treatment following the detection of distant metastasis after breast cancer surgery.","Department of Surgery, Innoshima-Ishikai Hospital, Hiroshima , Japan.

39869322,"IMPORTANCE: Cyclophosphamide and calcineurin inhibitors are the most used  nonsteroid immunosuppressive medications globally for children with various chronic inflammatory conditions. Their comparative effectiveness remains uncertain, leading to worldwide practice variation. Nephrotic syndrome is the most common kidney disease managed by pediatricians globally and suboptimal treatment is associated with high morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of cyclophosphamide vs calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) for childhood nephrotic syndrome relapse prevention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using target trial emulation methods, the study team emulated a pragmatic, open-label clinical trial using available data from the Insight Into Nephrotic Syndrome: Investigating Genes, Health, and Therapeutics (INSIGHT) study. INSIGHT is a multicenter, prospective cohort study in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Participants included children (1 to 18 years) with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome diagnosed between 1996 and 2019 from the Greater Toronto Area, who initiated cyclophosphamide or a calcineurin inhibitor treatment. Data analysis was performed in 2024. EXPOSURES: Incident cyclophosphamide or calcineurin inhibitor treatment. Randomization was emulated by overlap weighting of propensity scores for treatment assignment. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was time to relapse, analyzed by weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Secondary outcomes included relapse rates, subsequent immunosuppression, kidney function, hypertension, adverse events, and quality of life. RESULTS: Of 578 children (median age at diagnosis, 3.7 [IQR, 2.8-6.0] years; 371 male [64%] and 207 female [36%]), 252 initiated cyclophosphamide, 131 initiated calcineurin inhibitors, and 87 sequentially initiated both medications. Baseline characteristics were well balanced after propensity score weighting. During median 5.5-year (quarter 1 to quarter 3, 2.5-9.2) follow-up, there was no significant difference in time to relapse between calcineurin inhibitor vs cyclophosphamide treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.84-1.87). Relapses were more common after calcineurin inhibitor treatment than cyclophosphamide (85% vs 73%) in the weighted cohorts, but not statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in subsequent relapse rates, nonsteroid immunosuppression use, or kidney function between medications. Calcineurin inhibitor treatment was associated with more hospitalizations (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.14-2.92) and intravenous albumin use (HR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.65-4.81). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, there was no evidence of difference in time to relapse after cyclophosphamide and calcineurin inhibitor treatment in children with nephrotic syndrome. Cyclophosphamide treatment is shorter in duration and more accessible globally than calcineurin inhibitors.","Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick  Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick  Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick  Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, McMaster Children's Hospital,  Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University,  Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, The University of Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.; Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centres,  Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, The University of Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Paediatrics, Montreal Children's Hospital,  Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Program in Cell Biology, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children,  Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, William Osler Health Systems, Brampton, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick  Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick  Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick  Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Biostatistics, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, The University of  Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, United  Kingdom.; Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick  Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.",2829640 [pii]; poi240092 [pii]; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.5286 [doi],Robinson CH; Aman N; Banh T; Brooke J; Chanchlani R; Cuthbertson BH; Dhillon V; Fan E; Langlois V; Levin L; Licht C; McKay A; Noone D; Pearl R; Radhakrishnan S; Rowley V; Teoh CW; Vasilevska-Ristovska J; Heath A; Parekh RS,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Fan reported personal fees from Baxter,  Getinge, Inspira, and Vasomune outside the submitted work.

38109740,"BACKGROUND: According to drug labels, the frequency of thiazide-induced  hyponatremia is unknown or uncommon to very rare (that is, <1 in 10 000 to <1 in 100), but the exact burden remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the increase in the cumulative incidence of hyponatremia using thiazide diuretics compared with nonthiazide antihypertensive drugs in routine clinical practice. DESIGN: Population and register-based cohort study using target trial emulation. SETTING: Denmark, 1 January 2014 to 31 October 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Two target trials were emulated among persons aged 40 years or older who had no recent prescription for any antihypertensive drug, had no previous hyponatremia, and were eligible for the studied antihypertensive treatments. The first target trial emulation compared new use of bendroflumethiazide (BFZ) versus a calcium-channel blocker (CCB). The second target trial emulation compared new use of hydrochlorothiazide plus a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (HCTZ-RASi; that is, combination pill) versus a RASi alone. MEASUREMENTS: Two-year cumulative incidences of sodium levels less than 130 mmol/L using stabilized inverse probability of treatment-weighted survival curves. RESULTS: The study compared 37 786 new users of BFZ with 44 963 of a CCB and 11 943 new users of HCTZ-RASi with 85 784 of a RASi. The 2-year cumulative incidences of hyponatremia were 3.83% for BFZ and 3.51% for HCTZ-RASi. The risk differences were 1.35% (95% CI, 1.04% to 1.66%) between BFZ and CCB and 1.38% (CI, 1.01% to 1.75%) between HCTZ-RASi and RASi; risk differences were higher with older age and higher comorbidity burden. The respective hazard ratios were 3.56 (CI, 2.76 to 4.60) and 4.25 (CI, 3.23 to 5.59) during the first 30 days since treatment initiation and 1.26 (CI, 1.09 to 1.46) and 1.29 (CI, 1.05 to 1.58) after 1 year. LIMITATION: The study assumed that filled prescriptions equaled drug use, and residual confounding is likely. CONCLUSION: Treatment initiation with thiazide diuretics suggests a more substantial excess risk for hyponatremia, particularly during the first months of treatment, than indicated by drug labeling.

38947026,"Paxlovid has been approved for use in patients who are at high risk for severe  acute COVID-19 illness. Evidence regarding whether Paxlovid protects against Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or Long COVID, is mixed in high-risk patients and lacking in low-risk patients. With a target trial emulation framework, we evaluated the association of Paxlovid treatment within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection with incident Long COVID and hospitalization or death from any cause in the post-acute period (30-180 days after infection) using electronic health records from the Patient-Centered Clinical Research Networks (PCORnet) RECOVER repository. The study population included 497,499 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients between March 1, 2022, to February 1, 2023, and among which 165,256 were treated with Paxlovid within 5 days since infection and 307,922 were not treated with Paxlovid or other COVID-19 treatments. Compared with the non-treated group, Paxlovid treatment was associated with reduced risk of Long COVID with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87 to 0.89) and absolute risk reduction of 2.99 events per 100 persons (95% CI, 2.65 to 3.32). Paxlovid treatment was associated with reduced risk of all-cause death (HR, 0.53, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.60; risk reduction 0.23 events per 100 persons, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.28) and hospitalization (HR, 0.70, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.73; risk reduction 2.37 events per 100 persons, 95% CI 2.19 to 2.56) in the post-acute phase. For those without documented risk factors, the associations (HR, 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; risk increase 0.80 events per 100 persons, 95% CI -0.84 to 2.45) were inconclusive. Overall, high-risk, nonhospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who were treated with Paxlovid within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection had a lower risk of Long COVID and all-cause hospitalization or death in the post-acute period. However, Long COVID risk reduction with Paxlovid was not observed in low-risk patients.","Weill Cornell Medicine.; Weill Cornell Medicine.; Weill Cornell Medicine.; Weill Cornell Medicine.; Weill Cornell Medicine.; Weill Cornell Medicine.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania.; Northwestern University.; University of Washington School of Medicin.; University of Iowa.; 6Patient representative for Long COVID patients with the National Institutes of  Health's RECOVER Initiative.; Weill Cornell Medicine.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.; Louisiana Public Health Institute.; Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.",rs.3.rs-4536807 [pii]; 10.21203/rs.3.rs-4536807/v1 [doi],Wang F; Zang C; Li H; Khullar D; Zhang Y; Strobel S; Chen Y; Sala M; Patel P; Comellas A; Wylam A; Weiner M; Forrest C; Carton T; Kaushal R,ORCID: 0000-0001-9459-9461; ORCID: 0000-0002-8244-9551; ORCID: 0000-0001-5586-9940; ORCID: 0000-0002-4694-2517,,,,Additional Declarations: There is NO Competing Interest.,,2024/07/01 05:38,,20240620,2024 Jun 20,2024/07/01 06:42,,,"Wang, Fei; Zang, Chengxi; Li, Haoyang; Khullar, Dhru; Zhang, Yongkang; Strobel, Stephenson; Chen, Yong; Sala, Marc; Patel, Payal; Comellas, Alejandro; Wylam, Andrew; Weiner, Mark; Forrest, Christopher; Carton, Thomas; Kaushal, Rainu",,OT2 HL161847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; P30 ES005605/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States,,,2693-5015,2693-5015,,101768035,Research square,eng,rs.3.rs-4536807 [pii]; 10.21203/rs.3.rs-4536807/v1 [doi],20250116,,2024/07/01 06:43,,,,,,NLM,,,2024/07/01 05:38,2024/07/01 06:43,,2024/06/28 00:00,2024/07/01 06:42,,United States,PMC11213188,2024/06/28,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,Res Sq [Preprint]. 2024 Jun 20:rs.3.rs-4536807. doi: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-4536807/v1.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Res Sq,Real-World Effectiveness of Nirmatrelvir in Protecting Long COVID for Outpatient  Adult Patients - A Large-Scale Observational Cohort Study from the RECOVER Initiative.,,,,

We describe some of the challenges that make this field particularly difficult and expensive for evaluation studies. METHODS: We describe and review the use of novel study designs and analysis methodology for their potential to improve this situation. RESULTS: While several novel designs appeared ill-suited to our field, systematic review found others that offered potential but had yet to be widely adopted, some not at all. CONCLUSIONS: While funding is inevitably a constraint, we argue that improvements in the evidence base of both current and new treatments will only be achieved by the adoption of a number of these new technologies and study designs, the consistent application of rigorous constructive but demanding standards, and the engagement of the public, patients, clinical and research services to build a design, recruitment, and analysis infrastructure.","Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London,  London, UK.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London,  London, UK.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London,  London, UK.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London,  London, UK.",10.1111/jcpp.13892 [doi],Pickles A; Edwards D; Horvath L; Emsley R,ORCID: 0000-0003-1283-0346; ORCID: 0000-0001-7446-4324; ORCID: 0000-0002-1218-675X,© 2023 The Authors.

38032000,"BACKGROUND: Depression is prevalent in patients with CKD and is related to poor  prognosis. Despite the widespread use of antidepressants in the CKD population, their safety remains unclear. METHODS: We identified adults with CKD stages G3-5 (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 not treated with dialysis) and incident depression diagnosis during 2007-2019 from the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements project. Using the target trial emulation framework, we compared the following treatment strategies: ( 1 ) initiating versus not initiating antidepressants, ( 2 ) initiating mirtazapine versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and ( 3 ) initiating SSRIs with a lower dose versus a standard dose. RESULTS: Of 7798 eligible individuals, 5743 (74%) initiated antidepressant treatment. Compared with noninitiation, initiation of antidepressants was associated with higher hazards of short-term outcomes, including hip fracture (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 1.74) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.82 to 2.31), although not statistically significant. Initiation of antidepressants was not associated with long-term outcomes, including all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular event, CKD progression, and suicidal behavior. Compared with SSRIs, initiation of mirtazapine was associated with a lower hazard of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.96), but a higher hazard of mortality (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.22). Compared with the standard dose, initiation of SSRIs with a lower dose was associated with nonstatistically significantly lower hazards of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.34) and CKD progression (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.02), but a higher hazard of cardiac arrest (HR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.40). CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant treatment was associated with short-term adverse outcomes but not long-term outcomes in people with CKD and depression.","Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and  Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford,  United Kingdom.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.",01277230-990000000-00283 [pii]; CJASN-2023-000977 [pii]; 10.2215/CJN.0000000000000348 [doi],Zhu N; Xu H; Lagerberg T; Johnell K; Carrero JJ; Chang Z,ORCID: 0000-0003-3501-1351; ORCID: 0000-0002-7266-3431; ORCID: 0000-0003-2480-0216; ORCID: 0000-0003-4763-2024,Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Nephrology.,doi: 10.2215/CJN.0000000000000391,,"J.J.

40677193,"Objective: To explore the progress and trend in research of target trial  emulation (TTE) and provide reference for research in this field. Methods: A literature retrival of research papers in this field published as of November 30, 2024 was conducted based on three databases (i.e. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus). The papers which were highly cited were analyzed by Bibliometrix package in R 4.3.2. The co-occurrence network of keywords were analyzed by using software VOSviewer. The keyword burst test was carried out with software CiteSpace. Results: A total of 685 papers from 314 journals were included. The annual number of the papers published showed a significant growth in recent three years. JAMA Network Open had the highest publication mumber related to TTE (34 papers), Annals of Internal Medicine had the highest H-index and American Journal of Epidemiology had the highest total citations. In the 2 997 authors, Hernán MA made a greatest contribution. In the 2 046 institutions, Harvard Medical School was at leading position. The analysis on highly cited papers and keyword co-occurrence showed that TTE was mainly used in the studies of COVID-19 vaccine, cancer and the treatment efficacy and safety of chronic diseases. The analysis on the co-occurence of keyword burst test showed that keywords frequently used until 2024 were COVID-19 vaccine, cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Conclusions: TTE is mainly used in the studies of public health emergency (such as COVID-19), patients with cancer and chronic diseases. TTE will play a crucial role when randomized controlled trial is difficult to conduct or current evidence requirement can not be met.","Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking  University, Beijing 100191, China Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing 100191, China.; Research Center of Clinical Epidemiology, Peking University Third Hospital,  Beijing 100191, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking  University, Beijing 100191, China Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing 100191, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking  University, Beijing 100191, China Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing 100191, China Department of Ophthalmology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.",10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20241105-00694 [doi],Long ZL; Zhao HY; Liu ZX; Sun F,,,,,,,2025/07/18 04:47,20250718,,2025 Jul 10,2025/07/18 06:26,,,"Long, Z L; Zhao, H Y; Liu, Z X; Sun, F",,"72474008, 72074011/General Project of National Natural Science Foundation of  China/; 2020YJSZX-2/Special Project for Director, China Center for Evidence Based  Traditional Chinese Medicine/; 2025-Y-Y-012/Research Project by China Drug Administration Research Association/; CDR2024R01001/Project of Center for Drug Reevaluation of China National Medical  Products Administration/; 2023SKLDRS0153/State Key Laboratory of Drug Regulatory Science Project/",7,,,0254-6450,0254-6450,8208604,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,chi,10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20241105-00694 [doi],20250718,*Bibliometrics; Humans; COVID-19,2025/07/18 06:27,,,,,,NLM,1262-1268,,2025/07/18 04:47,2025/07/18 06:27,,,2025/07/18 06:26,,China,,,ppublish,English Abstract; Journal Article,,IM,,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2025 Jul 10;46(7):1262-1268. doi:  10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20241105-00694.,MEDLINE,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,[Global progress and trend in research of target trial emulation: a bibliometric  and visualization analysis].,,,,46
33567901,"This article provides a critical review of existing research on intimate  (marriage or marriage-like) relationship distress and risk for depression. Using the meta-framework of research triangulation, we seek to synthesize research evidence across several different methodologies and study designs and to draw the most reliable conclusion regarding a potential causal association between relationship distress and depression. Focusing on existing correlational (i.e., observational), genetically informed, and intervention (i.e., experimental) research on the association between relationship distress and depression, we conclude that the existing body of research evidence supports the claim that relationship distress is a causal risk factor for depression. A secondary aim of the article is to highlight a variety of effective methods that, when viewed from the perspective of triangulation, enhance the pursuit of causal inference, including propensity score matching, target trial emulation, directed acyclic graph approach, and Mendelian randomization.","Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Colorado Boulder,  Boulder, Colorado 80309-0345, USA; email: mark.whisman@colorado.edu.; Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721-0068, USA.; Center for Family Research and Department of Psychology, University of Georgia,  Athens, Georgia 30602-3013, USA.",10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-081219-103323 [doi],Whisman MA; Sbarra DA; Beach SRH,,,,,,,2021/02/11 05:33,20211025,20210210,2021 May 7,2021/02/12 06:00,,,"Whisman, Mark A; Sbarra, David A; Beach, Steven R H",,R01 AG059260/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; R01 CA220254/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,,,1548-5951,1548-5943,,101235325,Annual review of clinical psychology,eng,10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-081219-103323 [doi],20211025,*Depression/epidemiology/etiology; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; *Marriage; Risk Factors,2021/10/26 06:00,,,,causation; depression; marital distress; marital satisfaction; marriage; risk factors,NOTNLM,NLM,233-258,,2021/02/11 05:33,2021/10/26 06:00,,,2021/02/12 06:00,,United States,,,ppublish,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Review",,IM,,Annu Rev Clin Psychol. 2021 May 7;17:233-258. doi:  10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-081219-103323.

37949816,"BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of antimicrobial therapies, gram-negative  bacteremia remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality on a global level. Recent randomized controlled trials support shorter antibiotic treatment duration for individuals with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia. The target trial framework using the cloning approach utilizes real-world data but eliminates the issue of immortal time bias seen in observational studies by emulating the analysis of randomized trials with full adherence. METHOD: A hypothetical target trial allocating individuals with gram-negative bacteremia to either short antibiotic treatment duration (5-7 days) or longer antibiotic treatment duration (8-14 days) was specified and emulated using the cloning, censoring, and weighting approach. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome was a composite endpoint of clinical and microbiological relapse. The emulated trial included individuals from four hospitals in Copenhagen from 2018 through 2021. RESULTS: In sum, 1040 individuals were included. The median age of the cohort was 76 years, the majority were male (54%), had community-acquired gram-negative bacteremia (86%), urinary tract infection as the source of the infection (78%), and Escherichia coli as the pathogen of the infection (73%). The adjusted 90-day risk difference in all-cause mortality was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -.7, 3.3), and the risk ratio was 1.12 (95% CI: .89, 1.37). The adjusted 90-day risk difference in relapse was 0.7% (95% CI: -2.3, 3.8), and the risk ratio was 1.07 (95% CI: .71, 1.45). CONCLUSIONS: We found comparative outcomes for shorter treatment duration compared to longer treatment duration in patients with gram-negative bacteremia.","Department of Infectious Diseases, Center of Research and Disruption of  Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Center of Research and Disruption of  Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Microbiology, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and  Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Center of Research and Disruption of  Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital-Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.",7394678 [pii]; 10.1093/cid/ciad670 [doi],Tingsgård S; Bastrup Israelsen S; Østergaard C; Benfield T,ORCID: 0000-0003-0133-7345; ORCID: 0000-0002-0653-1289; ORCID: 0000-0003-0698-9385,"© The Author(s) 2023.

39252558,"By evaluating published emulations of oncology randomized control trial (RCT)  studies in which both the active and comparator groups are sourced from real-world data (RWD) and target trial results are available for benchmarking, this systematic review aims to gain insight into factors related to emulation performance. Thirteen oncology emulation studies using various types of RWD were identified through an online database search of PubMed through 2022. Based on the ROBINS-I tool, most studies (n = 8) had a serious risk of overall bias driven by risk of bias from confounding. Approximately half of the studies (n = 6) fully proxied the RCT entry criteria. Of 11 RWD studies that provided sufficient detail to quantify emulation performance, the emulation hazard ratio (HR) estimate fell within the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the trial estimate in 9 of the studies. There were no clear trends between risk of bias or degree to which the entry criteria were proxied and emulation performance. Findings may have been influenced by publication bias and researcher degrees of freedom, as only one emulation study preregistered its protocol. Tools for comprehensively characterizing factors that affect emulation performance, including the real-world clinical context as it relates to the RCT research question, are needed to evaluate the feasibility of a RCT emulation.

38477918,"IMPORTANCE: Few oncology studies have assessed the effectiveness of adjuvant  ovarian function suppression (OFS) in observational settings for premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Target trial emulation is increasingly used for estimating treatment outcomes in observational cohorts. OBJECTIVES: To describe hormone therapy and OFS treatment patterns (aim 1), examine the association between adding OFS to tamoxifen (TAM) or aromatase inhibitor (AI) and survival (aim 2), and examine the association between duration of hormone treatment (TAM or AI) plus OFS (H-OFS) and survival (aim 3). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study included all premenopausal, early-stage breast cancer diagnoses between 2010 and 2020 in Alberta, Canada. Target trial emulation was conducted. Eligibility criteria were directly modeled after the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) and Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial (TEXT). Participants were followed up for a maximum of 5 years. Data were analyzed from July 2022 through March 2023. EXPOSURES: For aim 2, exposures were receiving the following baseline treatments for 2 years: AI + OFS (AI-OFS), TAM + OFS (T-OFS), and TAM alone. For aim 3, exposures were a 2-year or greater and a less than 2-year duration of H-OFS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Recurrence-free survival was the primary outcome of interest. Marginal structural Cox models with inverse probability treatment and censoring weights were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for baseline and time-varying confounding variables. RESULTS: Among 3434 female patients with premenopausal, early-stage breast cancer diagnoses (median [IQR] age, 45 [40-48] years), 2647 individuals satisfied SOFT and TEXT eligibility criteria. There were 2260 patients who initiated TAM, 232 patients who initiated T-OFS, and 155 patients who initiated AI-OFS; 192 patients received H-OFS for 2 or more years, and 195 patients received H-OFS for less than 2 years. The 5-year recurrence risks were not significantly lower in AI-OFS vs TAM (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.38-1.33) or T-OFS vs TAM (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.50-1.45) groups. Patients receiving H-OFS for 2 or more years had significantly better 5-year recurrence-free survival compared with those receiving H-OFS for less than 2 years (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found no significant reductions in recurrence risk for AI-OFS and T-OFS compared with TAM alone. H-OFS duration for at least 2 years was associated with significantly improved recurrence-free survival.","Department of Community Health Sciences, Foothills Medical Centre, University of  Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Foothills Medical Centre, University of  Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Foothills Medical Centre, University of  Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.; Department of Surgery, Foothills Medical Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Foothills Medical Centre, University of  Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.; Department of Surgery, Foothills Medical Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Foothills Medical Centre, University of  Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Foothills Medical Centre, University of  Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.",2816030 [pii]; zoi240101 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.2082 [doi],Basmadjian RB; Lupichuk S; Xu Y; Quan ML; Cheung WY; Brenner DR,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.,,2024/03/13 11:36,20240314,20240304,2024 Mar 4,2024/03/13 12:44,,,"Basmadjian, Robert B; Lupichuk, Sasha; Xu, Yuan; Quan, May Lynn; Cheung, Winson Y; Brenner, Darren R",,,3,,2574-3805,2574-3805,,101729235,JAMA network open,eng,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.2082 [doi]; e242082,20241113,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; *Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Tamoxifen; Alberta; Aromatase Inhibitors; Hormones",2024/03/14 06:47,,,,,,NLM,e242082,,2024/03/13 11:36,2024/03/14 06:47,,2024/03/13 00:00,2024/03/13 12:44,,United States,PMC10938175,2024/03/13,epublish,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic); 094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen); 0 (Aromatase Inhibitors); 0 (Hormones)",IM,,JAMA Netw Open. 2024 Mar 4;7(3):e242082. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.2082.,MEDLINE,JAMA Netw Open,Adjuvant Ovarian Function Suppression in Premenopausal Hormone Receptor-Positive  Breast Cancer.,,,,7
39230896,"IMPORTANCE: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder  associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although parathyroidectomy has been associated with improvement of preexisting depression among adults with PHPT, the effect of parathyroidectomy on the development of new depression is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of early parathyroidectomy on the incidence of new depression among adults with PHPT compared with nonoperative management. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analyzed data included observational national Veterans Affairs data from adults with a new diagnosis of PHPT from 2000 through 2019 using target trial emulation with cloning, a biostatistical method that uses observational data to emulate a randomized clinical trial. New depression rates were compared between those treated with early parathyroidectomy vs nonoperative management using an extended Cox model with time-varying inverse probability censoring weighting, adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, and depression risk factors. Eligible adults with a new biochemical diagnosis of PHPT, excluding those with past depression diagnoses, residing in an assisted living/nursing facility, or with Charlson Comorbidity Index score higher than 4 were included. These data were analyzed January 4, 2023, through June 15, 2023. EXPOSURE: Early parathyroidectomy (within 1 year of PHPT diagnosis) vs nonoperative management. MAIN OUTCOME: New depression, including among subgroups according to patient age (65 years or older; younger than 65 years) and baseline serum calcium (11.3 mg/dL or higher; less than 11.3 mg/dL). RESULTS: The study team identified 40 231 adults with PHPT and no history of depression of whom 35896 were male (89%) and the mean (SD) age was 67 (11.3) years. A total of 3294 patients underwent early parathyroidectomy (8.2%). The weighted cumulative incidence of depression was 11% at 5 years and 18% at 10 years among patients who underwent parathyroidectomy, compared with 9% and 18%, respectively, among nonoperative patients. Those treated with early parathyroidectomy experienced no difference in the adjusted rate of new depression compared with nonoperative management (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.17). There was also no estimated effect of early parathyroidectomy on new depression in subgroup analyses based on patient age or serum calcium. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there was no difference in the incidence of new depression among adults with PHPT treated with early parathyroidectomy vs nonoperative management, which is relevant to preoperative discussions about the benefits and risks of operative treatment.","Stanford-Surgery Policy Improvement Research and Education Center (S-SPIRE),  Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto,  California.; Stanford-Surgery Policy Improvement Research and Education Center (S-SPIRE),  Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Stanford-Surgery Policy Improvement Research and Education Center (S-SPIRE),  Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Stanford-Surgery Policy Improvement Research and Education Center (S-SPIRE),  Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto,  California.; Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto,  California.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of  Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of  Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto,  Palo Alto, California.; Stanford-Surgery Policy Improvement Research and Education Center (S-SPIRE),  Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto,  California.; Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto,  Palo Alto, California.; Division of General Surgery, Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Palo  Alto, California.",2823102 [pii]; soi240064 [pii]; 10.1001/jamasurg.2024.3509 [doi],Delaney LD; Furst A; Day H; Arnow K; Cisco RM; Kebebew E; Montez-Rath ME; Tamura MK; Seib CD,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Kurella Tamura reported honorarium from the  American Society of Nephrology for service as Deputy Editor.

40690519,"BACKGROUND: Benchmarking an observational analysis against a randomized trial can  increase confidence in the use of observational data to complement inferences made in trials. Until now, few examples of benchmarking have been within oncology. However, benchmarking trials of a cancer treatment poses a unique set of challenges, such as defining composite outcomes like disease-free survival. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed a target trial with a protocol as similar as possible to the B-31 and N9831 randomized trials, which estimated the effect of adjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in individuals with early human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer. We then carried out an observational analysis by emulating the target trial using routinely collected data from Swedish registries to understand if we can estimate a similar effect of trastuzumab as the trial. The primary endpoint was the composite of disease-free survival consisting of the earliest of (1) local or regional recurrences, (2) distant recurrences, (3) contralateral breast cancer, (4) other second primary cancer, or (5) death from any cause. Individuals who had data compatible with both treatment strategies at baseline were cloned and one copy was assigned to each arm. We applied inverse probability weights to adjust for baseline and time-varying confounding (e.g., age and hematological events like neutropenia).. Our observational analysis included 1,578 women, with a median age of 59 years, and who were diagnosed between 2008 and 2015. We estimated a similar effect after five years of follow-up (RR: 0.54, 95% CI [0.44, 0.67]) for the composite endpoint of disease-free survival as the two jointly analyzed B-31 and N9831 trials (HR: 0.48, 95% CI [0.39, 0.59]). While the comparability of results increases confidence in our estimates, there remains a risk of residual and unmeasured confounding, as is the case with all observational analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully benchmarked an observational analysis against the B-31 and N9831 trials. By aligning protocols and using appropriate methodological approaches, we show that observational data can be used to estimate similar results as randomized trials of cancer treatments, like trastuzumab. This opens the door to using observational data to complement results from randomized trials of cancer treatments which can provide quick, cheap, and robust evidence to support decision-making where trials leave evidence gaps.","Institute of Public Health, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; RTI Health Solutions, Barcelona, Spain.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Institute of Public Health, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.",PMEDICINE-D-24-02383 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004661 [doi],Voelskow V; Garcia-Albeniz X; Berglund A; Feychting M; Kurth T; Matthews AA,ORCID: 0000-0002-1295-1087; ORCID: 0000-0002-9814-2343; ORCID: 0000-0002-5923-3293; ORCID: 0000-0002-5101-0060; ORCID: 0000-0001-7169-2620; ORCID: 0000-0002-1290-271X,"Copyright: © 2025 Voelskow et al.

40045450,"Non-randomized studies will remain the mainstay for evidence on medications'  effects in pregnancy since the number of pregnant participants in randomized clinical trials is insufficient to evaluate uncommon but serious pregnancy outcomes. There has been a growing interest in conceptualizing causal inference based on observational data as an attempt to emulate a hypothetical randomized trial: the target trial. This approach can help identify design flaws and ensuing biases and can point toward potential solutions. Adoption of the target trial emulation framework in perinatal studies raises unique challenges due to the distinct role of gestational time. Challenges include, among others, identifying the timing of conception, pregnancy losses as competing events for later outcomes, different etiologically relevant time windows depending on the outcome, and time-varying outcome risks. We discuss various considerations in developing a protocol for a target trial evaluating drug effects in pregnancy and its observational emulation in databases and registries. While not a panacea, the framework offers a valuable tool to guide us through the specification of the causal questions, the study population and the treatment strategies to be compared and helps to identify avoidable biases as well as unavoidable deviations from the optimal protocol. Making these deviations explicit elucidates the assumptions we make when drawing causal conclusions, and the types of analyses that can be undertaken to quantify the potential magnitude of such biases. Such discipline in the design, conduct, and reporting of pregnancy studies will ultimately lead to the best information possible to inform treatment decisions during pregnancy.","Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

38825327,"Most of the 800 000 people living with end-stage kidney disease in the United  States rely on a functioning vascular access to provide life-sustaining hemodialysis, yet one-third of arteriovenous fistulas experience early failures. Determining the safety and effectiveness of systemic heparin during fistula creation could improve the quality and quantity of life for these vulnerable patients. In this article, a pragmatic randomized trial was emulated to assess the effect of systemic heparin administration (vs none) during radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula creation on early bleeding and thrombosis, using data from 2 international, multicenter, randomized trials performed between 2014 and 2019. Marginal risks were estimated using inverse probability weighted parametric survival analysis and CIs were generated with bootstrapping. A total of 914 patients were enrolled and 61% received systemic heparin; their median (IQR) age was 58 (49, 67) years and 45% were on hemodialysis at enrollment. No difference in the risk of bleeding events was observed, with a risk difference (95% CI) at 14 days of -0.1% (-1.6 to 1.4).

38914249,"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggested breast conserving  therapy (BCT) and mastectomy have similar survival for early-stage breast cancer, whereas observational studies reported survival advantage for BCT. We aimed to address biases in observational studies to compare the effect of BCT and mastectomy on survival. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using institutional cancer registry. We included adult women diagnosed with early invasive first primary breast tumors ≤ 5 cm between July 2011 and December 2017. We used cloning, censoring, and weighting to estimate risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs) for all-cause mortality and recurrence or all-cause mortality between BCT and mastectomy (reference). RESULTS: Our study population comprised 534 observations with breast cancer. Median age was 56 years and 65 % were racial/ethnic minorities. The 8-year RD was 1.5 % (95 % confidence limits [CL]: -7.0 %, 9.8 %) and RR was 1.1 (95 % CL: 0.57, 2.2) for all-cause mortality. Results for recurrence or mortality were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that target trial emulation to mitigate selection and immortal-time biases in observational studies may generate estimates that are more compatible with RCTs when comparing the effects of BCT and mastectomy on survival. Studies with longer follow-up and more events are needed to confirm our findings.","Center for Epidemiology & Healthcare Delivery Research, JPS Health Network, Fort  Worth, TX, USA.; Center for Epidemiology & Healthcare Delivery Research, JPS Health Network, Fort  Worth, TX, USA.; Center for Epidemiology & Healthcare Delivery Research, JPS Health Network, Fort  Worth, TX, USA.; Oncology and Infusion Center, JPS Health Network, Fort Worth, TX, USA.; Oncology and Infusion Center, JPS Health Network, Fort Worth, TX, USA.; Oncology and Infusion Center, JPS Health Network, Fort Worth, TX, USA.; Center for Epidemiology & Healthcare Delivery Research, JPS Health Network, Fort  Worth, TX, USA.

35136932,"BACKGROUND: The impact of weight loss induced by bariatric surgery on cancer  occurrence is controversial. To study the causal effect of bariatric surgery on cancer risk from an observational database, a target-trial emulation technique was used to mimic an RCT. METHODS: Data on patients admitted between 2010 and 2019 with a diagnosis of obesity were extracted from a national hospital discharge database. Criteria for inclusion included eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery and the absence of cancer in the 2 years following inclusion. The intervention arms were bariatric surgery versus no surgery. Outcomes were the occurrence of any cancer and obesity-related cancer; cancers not related to obesity were used as negative controls. RESULTS: A total of 1 140 347 patients eligible for bariatric surgery were included in the study. Some 288 604 patients (25.3 per cent) underwent bariatric surgery. A total of 48 411 cancers were identified, including 4483 in surgical patients and 43 928 among patients who did not receive bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery was associated with a decrease in the risk of obesity-related cancer (hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95 per cent c.i. 0.83 to 0.95), whereas no significant effect of surgery was identified with regard to cancers not related to obesity (HR 0.96, 0.91 to 1.01). CONCLUSION: When emulating a target trial from observational data, a reduction of 11 per cent in obesity-related cancer was found after bariatric surgery.","Department of General Surgery, Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Créteil,  Créteil, France.; INSERM IMRB U955, Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Kaduceo SAS, Toulouse, France.; Kaduceo SAS, Toulouse, France.; Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, Unité  d'Épidémiologie et de Recherche Clinique, INSERM, Centre d'Investigation Clinique 1418, Module Épidémiologie Clinique, HEGP, Paris, France.; Université de Paris, Paris, France.; INSERM, UMRS 1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.; INSERM, IPLESP, équipe CLEPVIR.",6524038 [pii]; 10.1093/bjs/znac003 [doi],Lazzati A; Epaud S; Ortala M; Katsahian S; Lanoy E,ORCID: 0000-0002-3572-3132,"© The Author(s) 2022.

38636697,"OBJECTIVES: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in 2022, brings  substantial reforms to the US healthcare system, particularly regarding Medicare. A key aspect includes the introduction of Medicare price negotiation. The objective of this commentary is to explore the implications of the IRA for US pharmaceutical companies, with a specific focus on the role of real-world evidence (RWE) in the context of Medicare reforms. METHODS: This commentary uses a qualitative analysis of the IRA's provisions related to healthcare and pharmaceutical regulation, focusing on how these reforms change the evidence requirements for pharmaceutical companies. It discusses the methodological aspects of generating and using RWE, including techniques such as target trial emulation and quantitative bias analysis methods to address biases inherent in RWE. RESULTS: This commentary highlights that the IRA introduces a unique approach to value assessment in the United States by evaluating drug value several years after launch, as opposed to at launch, similar to health technology assessments in other regions. It underscores the central role of RWE in comparing drug effectiveness across diverse clinical scenarios to improve the accuracy of real-world data comparisons. Furthermore, this article identifies key methodologies for managing the inherent biases in RWE, which are crucial for generating credible evidence for IRA price negotiations. CONCLUSIONS: This article underscores the importance of these methodologies in ensuring credible evidence for IRA price negotiations. It advocates for an integrated approach in evidence generation, positioning RWE as pivotal for informed pricing discussions in the US healthcare landscape.","Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

39013588,"INTRODUCTION: The use of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) over  conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been advocated, but is also debated in the literature. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we adopted a target trial emulation framework to identify eligible patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2021 using the Taiwan Cancer Registry. In the primary analysis, the overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint, whereas incidences of lung cancer mortality and radiation pulmonary toxicity were the secondary endpoints. Extensive supplementary analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: We included 351 patients in the primary analysis and found that the OS was not significantly different between the SABR (n = 290) and CFRT (n = 61) groups. The propensity score weighting adjusted hazard ratio of death was 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.53-1.07, p = 0.118). The secondary endpoints and supplementary analyses showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: The OS of patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with SABR was not significantly different from that of patients treated with CFRT alone. The results of the relevant ongoing clinical trials are eagerly awaited.","Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung,  Taiwan.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Ph.D. Program for Health Science and Industry, College of Health Care, China  Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Chest Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung,  Taiwan.; Department of Chest Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung,  Taiwan.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung,  Taiwan.; Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung,  Taiwan.",TCA15404 [pii]; 10.1111/1759-7714.15404 [doi],Chen HJ; Cheng WC; Tu CY; Hsia TC; Lin YS; Fang HY; Li CC; Chien CR,ORCID: 0000-0002-2365-7641,"© 2024 The Author(s).

35641151,"To increase confidence in the use of observational analyses when addressing  effectiveness questions beyond those addressed by randomized trials, one can first benchmark the observational analyses against existing trial results. We used Swedish registry data to emulate a target trial similar to the Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia (TASTE) randomized trial, which found no difference in the risk of death or myocardial infarction by 1 year with or without thrombus aspiration among individuals with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. We benchmarked the emulation against the trial at 1 year and then extended the emulation's follow-up to 3 years and estimated effects in subpopulations underrepresented in the trial. As in the TASTE trial, the observational analysis found no differences in risk of outcomes by 1 year between groups (risk difference = 0.7 (confidence interval, -0.7, 2.0) and -0.2 (confidence interval, -1.3, 1.0) for death and myocardial infarction, respectively), so benchmarking was considered successful. We additionally showed no difference in risk of death or myocardial infarction by 3 years, or within subpopulations by 1 year. Benchmarking against an index trial before using observational analyses to answer questions beyond those the trial could address allowed us to explore whether the observational data can be trusted to deliver valid estimates of treatment effects.",,6596277 [pii]; kwac098 [pii]; 10.1093/aje/kwac098 [doi],Matthews AA; Dahabreh IJ; Fröbert O; Lindahl B; James S; Feychting M; Jernberg T; Berglund A; Hernán MA,,© The Author(s) 2022.

34529945,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for  estimating the effectiveness of a treatment. However, in many instances they are impractical to conduct because of time limitations, cost restrictions, or ethical reasons. As a consequence, non-randomized observational studies have an important role in comparative effectiveness and safety research since they can address issues that would not be possible using conventional RCT methodology. Observational studies can be strategically designed to reduce the risk of potential sources of bias by emulating the design principles of an equivalent but ideal randomized trial - the target trial - that would answer the research question of interest. In this article, we review some of the necessary components of observational studies required for valid causal inference within the framework of target trial emulation, so as to avoid common methodological pitfalls of study design. We discuss the assumptions of consistency, time-zero specification, exchangeability and positivity. To illustrate these concepts in a context where existing knowledge is well-established through clinical trials, we evaluate and compare the treatment effects of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) against no VKA (No VKA) on the treatment of atrial fibrillation from two real-world observational studies, namely the GARFIELD-AF and ORBIT-AF registries. Results are compared with those of published RCTs.","Thrombosis Research Institute, London, UK.

38913437,"KEY POINTS: Replacement strategies for hemodialysis catheters with mechanical  failure differed widely between services, which suggests clinical equipoise. For mechanical hemodialysis catheter failure, exchange did not result in more dysfunction or infection than removal and separate replacement. In Australia, infected catheters were almost universally removed and then replaced through a separate tunnel tract. BACKGROUND: Tunneled hemodialysis catheters often have infectious or mechanical complications that require unplanned removal and replacement, but the optimal replacement strategy is unknown. This study described the real-world use of two strategies in Australia and compared the survival of replacement catheters inserted by either strategy. METHODS: Observational data from the REDUcing the burden of dialysis Catheter ComplicaTIOns: a National approach trial, which enrolled a nationwide cohort of 6400 adults who received an incident hemodialysis catheter (2016–2020), was used for this secondary analysis. Tunneled catheters were replaced by either catheter exchange through the existing tunnel tract or removal and replacement through a new tract. The effect of the replacement strategy on the time to catheter removal because of infection or dysfunction was estimated by emulating a hypothetical pragmatic randomized trial among a subset of 434 patients with mechanical tunneled catheter failure. RESULTS: Of 9974 tunneled hemodialysis catheters inserted during the trial, 380 had infectious and 945 had mechanical complications that required replacement. Almost all infected hemodialysis catheters (97%) were removed and separately replaced through a new tunnel tract, whereas nephrology services differed widely in their replacement practices for catheters with mechanical failure (median=50% guidewire exchanged, interquartile range=30%–67%). Service-level differences accounted for 29% of the residual variation after adjusting for patient factors. In the target trial emulation cohort of patients with mechanical catheter failure (n=434 patients), catheter exchange was not associated with lower complication-free survival at 1, 6, or 12 months (counterfactual survival difference at 1 month=5.9%; 95% confidence interval, −2% to 14%). CONCLUSIONS: Guidewire exchange for mechanical failure of catheter was not associated with lower catheter survival and may be preferable for patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION AND PROTOCOL: The trial was registered in the Australia and New Zealand clinical trials registry on the June 23, 2016 (ACTRN12616000830493).","Department of Medicine, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Nephrology, Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.; The George Institute for Global Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales,  Australia.; Prince of Wales Hospital, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; The George Institute for Global Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales,  Australia.; South Western Sydney Campus, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Sunshine Coast University Hospital, Birtinya, Queensland, Australia.; School of Health, University of the Sunshine Coast, Sippy Downs, Queensland,  Australia.; The George Institute for Global Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales,  Australia.; Department of Nephrology, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, Australian Capital  Territory, Australia.; Australian National University School of Medicine, Acton, Australian Capital  Territory, Australia.; Department of Medicine, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Nephrology, Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Prahran,  Victoria, Australia.",01277230-990000000-00413 [pii]; CJASN-2024-000083 [pii]; 10.2215/CJN.0000000000000495 [doi],Lazarus B; Kotwal S; Gallagher M; Gray NA; Coggan S; Talaulikar G; Polkinghorne KR,ORCID: 0000-0001-7936-025; ORCID: 0000-0002-3294-4087; ORCID: 0000-0001-9187-6187; ORCID: 0000-0001-9112-0304; ORCID: 0000-0002-9851-002,,doi: 10.2215/CJN.0000000000000542,on behalf of the REDUCCTION investigators,"Disclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online  version of the article at http://links.lww.com/CJN/B952.",,2024/06/24 12:03,,20240624,2024 Sep 1,2024/06/24 18:42,,,"Lazarus, Benjamin; Kotwal, Sradha; Gallagher, Martin; Gray, Nicholas A; Coggan, Sarah; Talaulikar, Girish; Polkinghorne, Kevan R",,APP2005174/National Health and Medical Research Council/; Monash Graduate Excellence Scholarship/Monash University/; APP1103241/National Health and Medical Research Council/; MRF1150335/National Health and Medical Research Council/,9,,1555-905X,1555-9041,1555-9041,101271570,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,eng,10.2215/CJN.0000000000000495 [doi],20250708,,2024/06/24 18:42,,,,AKI and critical care; ESKD; chronic hemodialysis; clinical nephrology; dialysis; dialysis access; hemodialysis; hemodialysis access; hemodialysis hazards; vascular access,NOTNLM,NLM,1148-1158,2024/06/18 00:00,2024/06/24 12:03,2024/06/24 18:42,,2025/09/01 00:00,2024/06/24 18:42,2024/01/17 00:00,United States,PMC11390028,2025/09/01,ppublish,Journal Article,,IM,,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2024 Sep 1;19(9):1148-1158. doi:  10.2215/CJN.0000000000000495.

39067541,"OBJECTIVES: Some therapeutic strategy questions in oncology could be answered  with studies using observational data. Target trial emulation is the application of design principles from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to the analysis of observational data, to reduce design-induced biases. Our objective was to determine which type of study physicians would preferably plan to answer a comparative effectiveness question lacking evidence in oncology. METHODS: We launched an online survey among physicians specialized in oncology. We constructed a vignette-based inquiry where vignettes described study scenarios which could be conducted to answer the predefined question. We designed six vignettes described by study design (RCT or observational study with a trial emulation framework), main study characteristics, probability of the study succeeding and anticipated delay before results availability. Participants randomly assessed five pair-wise comparisons of the vignettes and were asked which study they would preferably plan by using a Likert scale ranging from -5 to 5. The main outcome was the evaluation of clinicians' preferences for each pairwise comparison. Mean and median preference scores were calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred thirteen participants, specialized in many tumor types, assessed at least one comparison with 82% reporting France as their country of affiliation. The interquartile range was -4 to 4 across pairwise comparisons. The median preference score was in disfavor of the monocentric RCT for the five comparisons where it appeared. The median preference score was strongly in favor of the multicentric national emulated trial when compared to the monocentric emulated trial 4 [IQR 2.5-4]. The mean preference score was the highest for the large European observational study 1.14 (SD 3.33), while the mean preference score was the lowest for the monocentric RCT -1.86 (SD 2.93). CONCLUSION: No study design was strongly preferred, but the monocentric RCT was the least favored study in pair-wise comparisons. The planification of the new research is a compromise between scientific soundness, feasibility, cost, and time before obtaining results. We need to have the right answers to the right questions at the right time.","Gastroenterology, Endoscopy and Digestive Oncology Unit, Hôpital Cochin,  Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Paris, 27 rue du Faubourg Saint Jacques, 75014, Paris, France; Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, 1 Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, 75004, Paris, France.

40415645,"OBJECTIVE: Among patients with gout, NSAIDs are commonly used despite scarce  safety data in this specific population. Therefore, we quantified the comparative cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs versus colchicine among patients with gout starting allopurinol. METHODS: We conducted a sequential, propensity score-matched, new-user comparative effectiveness study using the target trial emulation framework to compare the risk of MACE (composite of myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, or cardiovascular death) among patients with gout started on allopurinol who were prescribed NSAIDs or colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis. A sensivity analysis employed inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Secondarily, we examined the risk of MACE with colchicine or NSAIDs versus no prophylaxis. RESULTS: Among 18,120 propensity score-matched adults with gout starting allopurinol with NSAIDs or colchicine (83.5% male, mean age 60.9 years), the incidence of MACE and cardiovascular death were higher among NSAID users compared to colchicine users, with rate differences of 38.8 (95% CI, 15.4 to 62.2) and 10.9 (0.7 to 21.1) per 1000 person-years, respectively, and hazard ratios (HR) of 1.56 (1.11 to 2.17) and 2.50 (1.14 to 5.26), respectively. Results were similar when IPTW was applied. Compared to no prophylaxis, NSAID use was associated with a higher risk of MACE and MI with HRs 1.50 (1.17 to 1.91) and 1.93 (1.35 to 2.75), respectively. CONCLUSION: In these target trial emulations of patients with gout starting allopurinol, NSAID prophylaxis was associated with a higher risk of MACE than colchicine or no prophylaxis, suggesting the avoidance of NSAID for gout flare prophylaxis.","Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British  Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Academic Rheumatology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.; Department of Clinical and Molecular Sciences, Polytechnic University of Marche,  Ancona, Italy.; Academic Rheumatology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.; Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University of Alabama at  Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.; Rheumatology Section, Birmingham VA Medical Center.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Cardiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Baim Institute for  Clinical Research, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Rheumatology and Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Mongan Institute,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.",10.1002/art.43259 [doi],Yokose C; McCormick N; Lu N; Jiang B; Tan K; Chigurupati S; Rai S; Challener G; Aviña-Zubieta JA; Cipolletta E; Abhishek A; Gaffo A; Januzzi JL; Zhang Y; Choi HK,ORCID: 0000-0001-7557-3303; ORCID: 0000-0002-4147-8348; ORCID: 0000-0001-5526-663X; ORCID: 0000-0002-6881-8197; ORCID: 0000-0003-0121-4919; ORCID: 0000-0001-7365-7212; ORCID: 0000-0001-7638-0888,This article is protected by copyright.

40388163,"IMPORTANCE: Patients hospitalized with nonsevere COVID-19 continue to receive  community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) antibiotic treatment despite a low risk of bacterial coinfection. Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing contributes to global antibiotic resistance and also poses a threat to individual patients. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of CAP antibiotic treatment started on admission with clinical outcomes among a large sample of patients hospitalized for nonsevere COVID-19 in hospitals across the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used a target trial emulation design. Participants were adult, immunocompetent patients admitted to general care for COVID-19 from April 2020 to December 2023 at 1053 US-based acute-care hospitals that contribute data to the Premier Healthcare Database. Patients with nonpneumonia bacterial infections present on admission were excluded. Data were analyzed from April to October 2024. EXPOSURE: Receipt of a CAP antibiotic regimen on the day of admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite measure of deterioration (vasopressor, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, intermediate care, intensive care unit admission) and in-hospital mortality occurring on day 2 or later. The association between receipt of antibiotic therapy and the primary outcome was assessed using propensity methods while adjusting for a broad set of potential confounders, including cotreatments. RESULTS: The cohort included 520 405 patients with COVID-19 (median [IQR] age, 66 [53-78] years; 266 186 [51.2%] male), including 92 708 Black patients (17.8%), 63 619 Hispanic patients (12.2%), and 304 649 White patients (58.5%); 279 656 patients (53.7%) had Medicare insurance. A total of 160 482 patients (30.8%) were treated with a CAP antibiotic regimen on day 1 of admission. The primary composite outcome was higher in the CAP group (20.8%) compared with the unexposed (no antibiotic) group (18.4%), but the difference did not meet the predefined criteria for clinical significance (ASD, 4.1%). Patients who received CAP antibiotics had higher odds of poor clinical outcomes (propensity matched-odds ratio [OR], 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]; P = .003; inverse probability treatment weighted-OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.05]; P < .001; standardized mortality ratio weighted-OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.08-1.12]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large cohort study of patients hospitalized with nonsevere COVID-19, there was no clinically meaningful difference in outcomes with early antibiotic treatment. Given the risks associated with unnecessary antibiotic treatment, these results argue against routine antibiotic use in this population.","BerbeeWalsh Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison  School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison.; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of  Wisconsin-Madison, Madison.; BerbeeWalsh Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison  School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison.; BerbeeWalsh Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison  School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of  Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison.; School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison.; Department Healthcare Delivery and Population Sciences, University of  Massachusetts Chan Medical School-Baystate, Springfield.; Department Healthcare Delivery and Population Sciences, University of  Massachusetts Chan Medical School-Baystate, Springfield.; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine,  University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City.; Division of Health System Innovation & Research, Department of Population Health  Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City.; Department Healthcare Delivery and Population Sciences, University of  Massachusetts Chan Medical School-Baystate, Springfield.; Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School-Baystate,  Springfield.",2834241 [pii]; zoi250391 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.11499 [doi],Pulia MS; Griffin M; Schwei R; Pop-Vicas A; Schulz LT; Shieh MS; Pekow P; Vaughn VM; Lindenauer PK,,,doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.11507,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Schulz reported being employed by Cepheid  outside the submitted work.

33998290,"Background To understand when results from observational studies and randomized  trials are comparable, we performed an observational emulation of a target trial designed to ask similar questions as the VALIDATE (Bivalirudin Versus Heparin in ST-Segment and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Patients on Modern Antiplatelet Therapy) randomized trial. The VALIDATE trial compared the effect of bivalirudin and heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention on the risk of death, myocardial infarction, and bleeding across Sweden. Methods and Results We specified the protocol of a target trial similar to the VALIDATE trial, then emulated the target trial in the period before the VALIDATE trial took place using data from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry-the same registry in which the trial was undertaken. The target trial emulation and the VALIDATE trial both estimated little or no effect of bivalirudin versus heparin on the risk of death or myocardial infarction by 180 days (target trial emulation risk ratio for death, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.88 - 1.54]; VALIDATE trial hazard ratio for death, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.78 - 1.41]). The observational data, however, could not capture less severe cases of bleeding, resulting in an inability to define a bleeding outcome like the trial, and could not accurately estimate the comparative risk of death by 14 days, which may be the result of intractable confounding early in follow-up or the inability to precisely emulate the trial's eligibility criteria. Conclusions Using real-world data to emulate a target trial can deliver accurate effect estimates. Yet, even with rich observational data, it is not always possible to estimate the short-term effect of interventions or the effect on outcomes for which data are not routinely collected.","Unit of Epidemiology Institute of Environmental Medicine Karolinska Institutet  Stockholm Sweden.; Department of Cardiology Karolinska University Hospital Stockholm Sweden.; Department of Medicine Karolinska Institutet Huddinge Sweden.; Department of Biostatistics Harvard T.H.

40198137,"PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard design  to obtain knowledge of causal effects of treatments. However, not all causal questions can be answered by randomised trials for practical or ethical reasons. Target trial emulation is a conceptual framework and set of analysis methods to obtain knowledge of causal effects of treatments using observational data, and is particularly valuable when randomised trials are not feasible. OBJECTIVES: In this Perspective, we outline the concepts and application of target trial emulation, showing how it can be used to minimise bias due to confounding at baseline and over the course of sustained treatments, and how causal per-protocol analysis can be performed to provide informative yet unbiased estimates of treatment effects. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: We summarise a recent target trial emulation that examined the effects of intensity of early rehabilitation for hip fracture on performance in activities of daily living as a worked example. We encourage investigators to explore the target trial framework, and apply it to answer causal questions when using observational data.","School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of  Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Institute for Musculoskeletal Health, The University of Sydney and Sydney Local  Health District, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of  Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Institute for Musculoskeletal Health, The University of Sydney and Sydney Local  Health District, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of  Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",10.1080/09638288.2025.2487560 [doi],Diong J; Kwok W; Sherrington C,ORCID: 0000-0002-0077-3869,,,,,,2025/04/08 12:03,,20250408,2025 Apr 8,2025/04/08 13:55,,,"Diong, Joanna; Kwok, Wing; Sherrington, Catherine",,,,,1464-5165,0963-8288,,9207179,Disability and rehabilitation,eng,10.1080/09638288.2025.2487560 [doi],20250408,,2025/04/08 13:55,,"Target trial emulation is a framework and set of analysis methods to guide the  analysis of observational data to estimate causal effects.Target trial emulation makes assumptions transparent, ensures causal questions are realistic and can be answered, and helps minimise bias due to confounding.We summarise a recent study that emulated target trials to examine the effect of intensity of early rehabilitation for hip fracture on performance in activities of daily living.This makes treatment effects available from trials that may be difficult to run for practical reasons.",eng,Target trial; causal inference; comparative effectiveness; g-methods; per-protocol,NOTNLM,NLM,1-5,,2025/04/08 12:03,2025/04/08 13:55,,,2025/04/08 13:55,,England,,,aheadofprint,Journal Article; Review,,IM,,Disabil Rehabil. 2025 Apr 8:1-5. doi: 10.1080/09638288.2025.2487560.,Publisher,Disabil Rehabil,Enhancing knowledge of treatment effects by analysing observational data as a  randomised trial.,,,,
31038996,"Rationale: ""Target trial emulation"" has been proposed as an observational method  to answer comparative effectiveness questions, but it has rarely been attempted concurrently with a randomized clinical trial (RCT).Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that blinded analysts applying target trial emulation to existing observational data could predict the results of an RCT.Methods: PreVent (Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation) was a multicenter RCT examining the effects of positive-pressure ventilation during tracheal intubation on oxygen saturation and severe hypoxemia. Analysts unaware of PreVent's results used patient-level data from three previous trials evaluating airway management interventions to emulate PreVent's eligibility criteria, randomization procedure, and statistical analysis. After PreVent's release, results of this blinded observational analysis were compared with those of the RCT. Difference-in-differences estimates for comparison of treatment effects between the observational analysis and the PreVent trial are reported on the absolute scale.Results: Using observational data, we were able to emulate PreVent's randomization procedure to produce balanced groups for comparison. The lowest oxygen saturation during intubation was higher in the positive-pressure ventilation group than the no positive-pressure ventilation group in the observational analysis (n = 360; mean difference = 1.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.0 to 4.6) and in the PreVent trial (n = 401; mean difference = 3.9%; 95% CI = 1.4 to 6.4), though the observational analysis could not exclude no difference. Difference-in-differences estimates comparing treatment effects showed reasonable agreement for lowest oxygen saturation between the observational analysis and the PreVent trial (mean difference = -2.1%; 95% CI = -5.9 to 1.7). Positive-pressure ventilation resulted in lower rates of severe hypoxemia in both the observational analysis (risk ratio = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.93) and in the PreVent trial (risk ratio = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.77). The absolute reduction in the incidence of severe hypoxemia with positive-pressure ventilation was similar in the observational analysis (9.4%) and the PreVent trial (12.0%), though the difference between these estimates had wide CIs (mean difference = 2.5%; 95% CI = -8.0 to 13.6%).Conclusions: Applying target trial emulation methods to existing observational data for the evaluation of a novel intervention produced results similar to those of a randomized trial. These findings support the use of target trial emulation for comparative effectiveness research.","1Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine.; 2Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.; 2Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.; 3Department of Learning Health Sciences, and.; 4Veterans Affairs Center for Clinical Management Research, Health Services  Research and Development Center of Innovation, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; 5Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt  University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; 6Section of Pulmonary/Critical Care & Allergy/Immunology, Louisiana State  University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana.; 7Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, & Critical Care Medicine, University of Alabama  at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.; 8Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Washington,  Seattle, Washington.; 9Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Ochsner Health System New  Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana.; 10Department of Medicine, Section of Emergency Medicine, Louisiana State  University School of Medicine-New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana; and.; 9Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Ochsner Health System New  Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana.; 11Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Lahey  Hospital and Medical Center, Burlington, Massachusetts.; 11Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Lahey  Hospital and Medical Center, Burlington, Massachusetts.; 5Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt  University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; 1Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine.; 2Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.; 12Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; 4Veterans Affairs Center for Clinical Management Research, Health Services  Research and Development Center of Innovation, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; 5Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt  University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.",10.1513/AnnalsATS.201903-241OC [doi],Admon AJ; Donnelly JP; Casey JD; Janz DR; Russell DW; Joffe AM; Vonderhaar DJ; Dischert KM; Stempek SB; Dargin JM; Rice TW; Iwashyna TJ; Semler MW,ORCID: 0000-0002-7432-3764,,Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2019 Aug;16(8):977-979. doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201905-397ED.

38929645,"Partial hepatectomy and ablation therapy are two widely used surgical procedures  for localized early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This article aimed to evaluate their relative effectiveness in terms of overall survival. An emulation analysis approach was first developed based on the Bayesian technique. We estimated propensity scores via Bayesian logistic regression and adopted a weighted Bayesian Weibull accelerated failure time (AFT) model incorporating prior information contained in the published literature. With the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, an emulated target trial with rigorously defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and treatment regimens for early-stage HCC patients over 66 years old was developed. For the main cohort with tumor size less than or equal to 5 cm, a total of 1146 patients were enrolled in the emulated trial, with 301 and 845 in the partial hepatectomy and ablation arms, respectively. The analysis suggested ablation to be significantly associated with inferior overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.14, 1.60). For the subgroup with tumor size less than or equal to 3 cm, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two arms (HR = 1.15; 95% CrI: 0.88, 1.52). Overall, the comparative treatment effect of ablation and partial hepatectomy on survival remains inconclusive. This finding may provide further insight into HCC clinical treatment.","Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510,  USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), Omaha,  NE 68198, USA.; Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, New  Haven, CT 06510, USA.; Yale Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center,  New Haven, CT 06520, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510,  USA.",life14060661 [pii]; life-14-00661 [pii]; 10.3390/life14060661 [doi],Wang J; Im Y; Wang R; Ma S,ORCID: 0000-0003-3741-4269,,,,The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,,2024/06/27 01:14,,20240522,2024 May 22,2024/06/27 06:43,,,"Wang, Jiping; Im, Yunju; Wang, Rong; Ma, Shuangge",,R03 CA276790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; CA276790/NH/NIH HHS/United States; R21 HL161691/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; HL161691/NH/NIH HHS/United States; UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States,6,,2075-1729,2075-1729,2075-1729,101580444,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,10.3390/life14060661 [doi]; 661,20250314,,2024/06/27 06:44,,,,Bayesian survival; HCC; SEER-Medicare; comparative effectiveness; target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,,2024/05/21 00:00,2024/06/27 01:14,2024/06/27 06:44,2024/05/19 00:00 [revised],2024/05/22 00:00,2024/06/27 06:43,2024/04/21 00:00,Switzerland,PMC11204969,2024/05/22,epublish,Journal Article,,,,Life (Basel). 2024 May 22;14(6):661. doi: 10.3390/life14060661.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Life (Basel),Partial Hepatectomy and Ablation for Survival of Early-Stage Hepatocellular  Carcinoma Patients: A Bayesian Emulation Analysis.,,,,14

40395624,"BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterised by  haemolytic anaemia, bone marrow failure and thrombosis. The single-arm phase 3 APPOINT-PNH trial (NCT04820530) investigating iptacopan monotherapy in complement inhibitor-naive patients demonstrated significant haemoglobin concentration improvements. METHODS: We used target trial emulation to retrospectively predict outcomes if APPOINT-PNH trial patients had received C5 inhibitors instead of iptacopan. Estimates were derived from the real-world APPEX cohort treated with routine C5 inhibitors. The study used benchmarking and comparative effectiveness to evaluate the haematological response in APPOINT-PNH if patients had received C5 inhibitors. Treatment effect was estimated using propensity scores to model the probability of trial inclusion based on baseline covariates, followed by fitting an outcome model to the APPEX cohort. RESULTS: The analysis of 125 patients showed all estimated treatment effects (95% confidence interval) favoured iptacopan over C5 inhibitors: differences in the proportion of patients achieving haemoglobin increase from baseline of ≥ 2 g/dL, 68.2% (40.9-95.6); haemoglobin levels of ≥ 12 g/dL, 53.4% (31.4-75.3); transfusion independence, 38.8% (15.1-62.5); ratio of percent change from baseline in lactate dehydrogenase levels, 0.51 (0.40-0.67); change from baseline in reticulocytes, -75.5 × 10(9)/L (-106.9, -44.2). CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate C5 inhibitor-naive patients with PNH may experience greater haematological response with iptacopan than with C5 inhibitors.

40701585,"INTRODUCTION: Methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone are effective medications for  people with opioid use disorder; however, interruptions in daily dosing are common and diminish the benefits of these medications. While clinical guidelines in most North American jurisdictions, including British Columbia (BC), recommend dose adjustment after treatment interruptions to varying levels of specificity, the evidence to support these recommendations is limited. We aim to estimate the comparative effectiveness of alternative dose adjustment strategies on subsequent overdose-related acute care visits and discontinuation of opioid agonist treatment in BC, Canada. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a linkage of nine health administrative databases, we propose a population-level retrospective cohort study of adults aged 18 years or older in BC who initiated methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2022. We will specify parallel hypothetical trials, known as target trials, for methadone interruptions of 1-3 days, 4 days and 5-14 days, and buprenorphine/naloxone interruptions of 1-5 days and 6-14 days. Following the index interruption, the primary outcomes are the time to overdose-related acute care visits and treatment discontinuation (interruptions lasting >14 days), with time to all-cause acute care visits as a secondary outcome. The intention-to-treat effect will be estimated using both propensity score and instrumental variable approaches. A range of sensitivity analyses will assess the robustness of our results, including cohort and timeline restriction, alternative definitions of exposure and outcome and alternative estimation strategies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol, cohort creation and analysis plan have been classified and approved as a quality improvement initiative by Providence Health Care Research Institute and the Simon Fraser University Office of Research Ethics. All data are deidentified, securely stored and accessed in accordance with provincial privacy regulations. Results will be disseminated to local advocacy groups and decision-makers, national and international clinical guideline developers, presented at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals electronically and in print.","School of Population and Public Health, The University of British Columbia,  Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; University of Barishal, Barishal, Bangladesh.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia,  Canada.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Department of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British  Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre on Substance Use, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Department of Statistics, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British  Columbia, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill  University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British  Columbia, Canada.; British Columbia Centre on Substance Use, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada  bnosyk@sfu.ca.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia,  Canada.; School of Population and Public Health, The University of British Columbia,  Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",bmjopen-2024-098318 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjopen-2024-098318 [doi],Mondol MH; Min JE; Kurz M; Zanette M; Hossain MB; Bach P; Gustafson P; Platt RW; Seaman S; Socías ME; Nosyk B; Karim ME,ORCID: 0000-0002-2624-2118; ORCID: 0000-0002-0968-722X; ORCID: 0009-0007-8469-7210; ORCID: 0000-0003-4603-863X; ORCID: 0000-0002-2375-5006; ORCID: 0000-0003-3726-5937; ORCID: 0000-0003-2513-3718,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

40690769,"BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been shown  to decrease blood glucose levels, promote weight loss, and prevent cardiovascular events. However, evidence is limited regarding their effect on dementia, although emerging observational studies, some with serious methodological limitations, have suggested large reductions in dementia associated with GLP-1RAs that may not be entirely causally related. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of GLP-1RAs versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) as second-line therapy for type 2 diabetes on risk for dementia among older adults. DESIGN: Target trial emulation. SETTING: United States from January 2016 to December 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 66 years or older with diabetes who used metformin and did not have dementia at baseline and initiated GLP-1RAs or DPP4is between January 2017 and December 2018. MEASUREMENTS: Onset of dementia was defined as 1 year before the date of a new dementia diagnosis. Risks were calculated at 30 months in GLP-1RA and DPP4i groups matched in a 1:2 ratio on an estimated propensity score and compared via ratios and differences. RESULTS: Among 2418 patients initiating GLP-1RAs and 4836 matched patients initiating DPP4is, the mean age was 71 years, and 55% were female. Over a median follow-up of 1.9 years, the outcome occurred in 96 patients in the GLP-1RA group and 217 in the DPP4i group. The estimated risk difference at 30 months was -0.93 (95% CI, -2.33 to 0.23) percentage points, and the estimated risk ratio was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.05). The estimated risk ratios were 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.93) and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.66) among those younger than 75 years and aged 75 years or older, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Potential residual confounding (no data on body mass index, glycemic control, or duration of diabetes), outcome misclassification, and short follow-up. CONCLUSION: Among older adults with diabetes, no clear evidence was found that the incidence of dementia differed overall between patients using GLP-1RAs versus DPP4is. Under conventional statistical criteria, an effect of GLP-1RAs between a 39% decrease and a 5% increase in risk for dementia was highly compatible with the data, although estimates differed by age. Randomized trials are needed to quantify the effect of GLP-1RAs on dementia.

34965955,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The median kidney transplant half-life is 10-15 years.  Because of the scarcity of donor organs and immunologic sensitization of candidates for retransplantation, there is a need for quantitative information on if and when a second transplantation is no longer associated with a lower risk of mortality compared with waitlisted patients treated by dialysis. Therefore, we investigated the association of time on waiting list with patient survival in patients who received a second transplantation versus remaining on the waiting list. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In this retrospective study using target trial emulation, we analyzed data of 2346 patients from the Austrian Dialysis and Transplant Registry and Eurotransplant with a failed first graft, aged over 18 years, and waitlisted for a second kidney transplantation in Austria during the years 1980-2019. The differences in restricted mean survival time and hazard ratios for all-cause mortality comparing the treatment strategies ""retransplant"" versus ""remain waitlisted with maintenance dialysis"" are reported for different waiting times after first graft loss. RESULTS: Second kidney transplantation showed a longer restricted mean survival time at 10 years of follow-up compared with remaining on the waiting list (5.8 life months gained; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 11.1). This survival difference was diminished in patients with longer waiting time after loss of the first allograft; restricted mean survival time differences at 10 years were 8.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.9 to 14.0) and 0.1 life months gained (95% confidence interval, -14.3 to 15.2) for patients with waiting time for retransplantation of <1 and 8 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Second kidney transplant is associated with patient survival compared with remaining waitlisted and treatment by dialysis, but the survival difference diminishes with longer waiting time.","Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Clinical Biometrics, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and  Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Epidemiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Nephrology, Transplant Center, Institute for Clinical and  Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.; Department of Nephrology, Transplant Center, Institute for Clinical and  Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.; Department of Nephrology, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium.; Department of Nephrology and Medical Intensive Care, Charité Universitätsmedizin,  Berlin, Germany.; Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine IV-Nephrology and Hypertension, Medical  University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Austrian Dialysis and Transplant Registry, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.",01277230-202201000-00014 [pii]; 07620621 [pii]; 10.2215/CJN.07620621 [doi],Kainz A; Kammer M; Reindl-Schwaighofer R; Strohmaier S; Petr V; Viklicky O; Abramowicz D; Naik M; Mayer G; Oberbauer R,ORCID: 0000-0001-8888-440; ORCID: 0000-0002-4419-6282; ORCID: 0000-0002-6556-9199,Copyright © 2022 by the American Society of Nephrology.,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2022 Jan;17(1):6-7. doi: 10.2215/CJN.15021121.

38344177,"Introduction: In causal inference, the correct formulation of the scientific  question of interest is a crucial step. The purpose of this study was to apply causal inference principles to external control analysis using observational data and illustrate the process to define the estimand attributes. Methods: This study compared long-term survival outcomes of a pooled set of three previously reported randomized phase 3 trials studying patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer receiving front-line chemotherapy and similar patients treated with front-line chemotherapy as part of routine clinical care. Causal inference frameworks were applied to define the estimand aligned with the research question and select the estimator to estimate the estimand of interest. Results: The estimand attributes of the ideal trial were defined using the estimand framework. The target trial framework was used to address specific issues in defining the estimand attributes using observational data from a nationwide electronic health record-derived de-identified database. The two frameworks combined allow to clearly define the estimand and the aligned estimator while accounting for key baseline confounders, index date, and receipt of subsequent therapies. The hazard ratio estimate (point estimate with 95% confidence interval) comparing the randomized clinical trial pooled control arm with the external control was close to 1, which is indicative of similar survival between the two arms. Discussion: The proposed combined framework provides clarity on the causal contrast of interest and the estimator to adopt, and thus facilitates design and interpretation of the analyses.","Product Development Data Sciences, F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.; Flatiron Health, Inc., New York, NY, United States.; Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA, United States.; Flatiron Health, Inc., New York, NY, United States.; Flatiron Health, Inc., New York, NY, United States.; Flatiron Health, Inc., New York, NY, United States.; Product Development Data Sciences, F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.; Product Development Data Sciences, F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.",1223858 [pii]; 10.3389/fphar.2024.1223858 [doi],Polito L; Liang Q; Pal N; Mpofu P; Sawas A; Humblet O; Rufibach K; Heinzmann D,,"Copyright © 2024 Polito, Liang, Pal, Mpofu, Sawas, Humblet, Rufibach and  Heinzmann.",,,"QL, PM, AS and OH were employed by Flatiron Health, Inc., an independent member  of the Roche Group, and stock ownership in Roche.

37433229,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has  been shown to effectively reduce blood pressure and body weight, but its effectiveness for reducing (cardiovascular) mortality rates has never been assessed in a clinical trial. Causal effects of dietary interventions are difficult to measure, due to practical limitations of randomized controlled diet trials. Target trial emulation can be used to improve causal inference in observational data. The aim of this study was to emulate a target trial assessing the relationship between compliance with the DASH diet and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk in patients with established CVD. METHODS: Using data from the Alpha Omega Cohort, we emulated a DASH diet trial in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance confounders over DASH-compliant and non-DASH-compliant participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with IPT-weighted Cox models. RESULTS: Of 4365 patients (79% male, median age 69 years, >80% treated with lipid- and blood pressure-lowering medication), 598 were classified as DASH-compliant (compliance score ≥5 out of 9). During a median follow-up of 12.4 years, 2035 deaths occurred of which 903 (44%) were of cardiovascular origin. DASH compliance was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.0.80-1.06) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.90, 95%CI 0.72-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: In an emulated target trial on the DASH diet in the Alpha Omega cohort no relation was found between DASH compliance and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with a history of MI. The DASH diet's effects may have been modified in this population by concomitant use of blood pressure-lowering medications.","Department of Vascular Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht  University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.; Division of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen University, Wageningen, the  Netherlands.; Department of Vascular Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht  University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.

33398914,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: No clinical trial has examined the risk of infection  associated methotrexate and azathioprine, two advocated treatments for sarcoidosis. We aimed to compare the 6-month risk of infection after the initiation of methotrexate or azathioprine. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective target trial emulation using Swedish pre-existing data. We searched for eligible participants who were dispensed methotrexate or azathioprine in the Prescribed Drug Register (PDR) every day between January 2007 and June 2013. Adults were eligible if they had ≥2 ICD-coded visits for sarcoidosis in the National Patient Register (NPR) and were dispensed ≥1 systemic corticosteroid but no methotrexate or azathioprine in the past 6 months (PDR). Within 6 months of methotrexate or azathioprine initiation, diagnosis of infectious disease was identified (visit in the NPR where infectious disease was the primary diagnosis). We estimated RR and risk differences comparing methotrexate (n = 667) to azathioprine initiations (n = 259) using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidity and sarcoidosis severity proxies. RESULTS: There were 43 infections in the methotrexate group (adjusted 6-month risk 6.8%) and 29 infections in the azathioprine group (12.0%). The RR for infectious disease at 6 months associated with methotrexate compared to azathioprine initiation was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.82) and the risk difference was -5.2% (95% CI: -8.5%, -1.8%). The RR at 9 months was attenuated to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.14). CONCLUSION: Methotrexate appears to be associated with a lower risk of infection in sarcoidosis than azathioprine, but randomized trials should confirm this finding.","Clinical Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Respiratory Medicine Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Theme Inflammation and Infection, Karolinska  University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Clinical Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Respiratory Medicine Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Theme Inflammation and Infection, Karolinska  University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Respiratory Medicine Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Theme Inflammation and Infection, Karolinska  University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Clinical Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Rheumatology, Theme Inflammation and Infection, Karolinska  University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Clinical Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.",RESP14001 [pii]; 10.1111/resp.14001 [doi],Rossides M; Kullberg S; Di Giuseppe D; Eklund A; Grunewald J; Askling J; Arkema EV,ORCID: 0000-0002-9769-324X,"© 2021 The Authors.

38680613,"BACKGROUND: Lamivudine + dolutegravir maintenance dual therapy (DT) could be less  effective than 3-drug therapy (TT) in the context of resistance-associated mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The ARCA database was queried to test this hypothesis with a trial emulation strategy. METHODS: People with HIV taking 2 NRTIs plus a protease inhibitor or a non-NRTI who switched to DT or dolutegravir-based TT were followed up from the first HIV RNA <50 copies/mL (baseline) to virologic failure (VF; ie, 2 consecutive HIV RNA ≥50 copies/mL or 1 HIV RNA ≥200 copies/mL). Those switching to DT within 6 months were assigned to the treatment arm and all other patients to the control arm. Each participant was also cloned, assigned to the opposite strategy, and censored at the time of deviation from that strategy. Using inverse probability of censoring weight Cox regression models, we calculated hazard ratios of VF for DT vs TT stratified for the presence of resistance-associated mutations. RESULTS: Overall 626 people were analyzed: 204 with DT and 422 with TT (73% men; mean age, 44 years). Ten and 31 VFs occurred with DT and TT, respectively, over a median 5.8 years. When compared with a fully active TT, the DT had similar efficacy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, .29-2.61; P = .812) when full susceptibility was confirmed at historical genotype. When previous M184V/I was present in both groups, the risk of VF was higher for DT vs TT but was not statistically significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, .45-20.84; P = .252). CONCLUSIONS: DT was not associated with a significantly higher risk of VF than dolutegravir-based TT.","Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

40202479,"BACKGROUND: Fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy is administered first-line for many  gastrointestinal cancers. However, patients with cardiovascular disease commonly receive alternative treatment due to cardiotoxicity concerns. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the risks of all-cause mortality and acute cardiovascular events with fluoropyrimidine treatment. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study applying a target trial emulation framework to linked national cancer, cardiac, and hospitalization registry data from the Virtual Cardio-Oncology Research Initiative. Adults diagnosed with tumors eligible for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy were included. All-cause mortality and a composite of hospitalization for acute cardiovascular events (acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac intervention, cardiac arrest, and cardiac death) were compared in patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy vs alternative management. Adjusted, weighted pooled logistic regression models were used to estimate the 1-year risk difference (RD). RESULTS: Among 103,110 patients (mean age 69.7 years, 59% male), the absolute risk of death at 1 year was significantly lower in fluoropyrimidine-treated patients (RD: -7.7%; 95% CI: -8.7% to -6.7%) with a small increased risk of acute cardiovascular events (RD: 0.9%; 95% CI: 0.0% to 1.9%). This was primarily due to arrhythmias (RD: 0.8%; 95% CI: 0.1% to 1.6%) and cardiac arrest (RD: 0.3%; 95% CI: 0.1% to 0.5%), with no increased risk of acute coronary syndromes including in the subgroup of patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS: The markedly improved overall survival with fluoropyrimidines in patients with gastrointestinal cancer significantly outweighs the small risk of cardiac arrhythmia and arrest. Oncologists should take this into consideration for decision making to avoid undue clinical conservatism, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease.","Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, United Kingdom;  Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom; National Disease Registration Service, NHS England, Wellington Place, Leeds, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, United Kingdom;  National Disease Registration Service, NHS England, Wellington Place, Leeds, United Kingdom; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London, United Kingdom.; National Disease Registration Service, NHS England, Wellington Place, Leeds,  United Kingdom; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.; National Disease Registration Service, NHS England, Wellington Place, Leeds,  United Kingdom.; National Disease Registration Service, NHS England, Wellington Place, Leeds,  United Kingdom; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, United Kingdom; Cancer Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom; Centre for Medicines Optimization Research and Education, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; National Disease Registration Service, NHS England, Wellington Place, Leeds,  United Kingdom.; National Disease Registration Service, NHS England, Wellington Place, Leeds,  United Kingdom.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, United Kingdom;  National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit, Leicester, United Kingdom.; National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, NHS Arden and Greater  East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit, Leicester, United Kingdom.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester,  United Kingdom.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester,  United Kingdom; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.; Barts Cancer Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Cancer Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,  London, United Kingdom; Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, United Kingdom; Centre for Medicines Optimization Research and Education, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, University of Leicester, Glenfield Hospital,  Leicester, United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK, London, England.; Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research  Centre, University of Leicester, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, United Kingdom;  Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom; National Disease Registration Service, NHS England, Wellington Place, Leeds, United Kingdom.

36162111,"BACKGROUND: Continuation of biologics for inflammatory disorders during pregnancy  is still a difficult decision. Many women with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) stop anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment after 24 weeks. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of anti-TNF continuation after 24 weeks of pregnancy for mothers with IBD and their offspring. DESIGN: Target trial emulation between 2010 and 2020. SETTING: Nationwide population-based study using the Système National des Données de Santé. PATIENTS: All pregnancies with birth exposed to anti-TNF between conception and 24 weeks of pregnancy in women with IBD. INTERVENTION: Continuation of anti-TNF after 24 weeks of pregnancy. MEASUREMENTS: Occurrence of maternal IBD relapse up to 6 months after pregnancy, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and serious infections in the offspring during the first 5 years of life was compared according to anti-TNF continuation after 24 weeks of pregnancy using inverse probability-weighted marginal models. RESULTS: A total of 5293 pregnancies were included; among them, anti-TNF treatment was discontinued before 24 weeks for 2890 and continued beyond 24 weeks for 2403. Continuation of anti-TNF was associated with decreased frequencies of maternal IBD relapse (35.8% vs. 39.0%; adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]) and prematurity (7.6% vs. 8.9%; aRR, 0.82 [CI, 0.68 to 0.99]). No difference according to anti-TNF continuation was found regarding stillbirths (0.4% vs. 0.2%; aRR, 2.16 [CI, 0.64 to 7.81]), small weight for gestational age births (13.1% vs. 12.9%; aRR, 1.01 [CI, 0.88 to 1.17]), and serious infections in the offspring (54.2 vs. 50.2 per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.08 [CI, 0.94 to 1.25]). LIMITATION: Algorithms rather than clinical data were used to identify patients with IBD, pregnancies, and serious infections. CONCLUSION: Continuation of anti-TNF after 24 weeks of pregnancy appears beneficial regarding IBD activity and prematurity, while not affecting neonatal outcomes and serious infections in the offspring.

39843330,"OBJECTIVE: Bictegravir or dolutegravir based antiretroviral therapy are  first-line HIV treatments. However, no trial has recruited enough participants to estimate the most effective treatment, and there is little evidence on the comparative effectiveness of bictegravir and other available antiretrovirals, like efavirenz and raltegravir. METHODS: We emulated a four-arm target trial using country-wide data from Mexico. The eligibility criteria of the target trial were people with HIV, treatment naïve with viral load >500 copies/mL, without tuberculosis, not pregnant, and started either bictegravir, dolutegravir, efavirenz or raltegravir-based treatment between July 2019 and September 2021. The main outcome was the probability of viral suppression (HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL) at three months estimated using an adjusted logistic regression model, with assignment assumed to be random within levels of adjusted covariates. Probabilities were compared via differences and non-parametric bootstrapping was used to calculate 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: 20,285 individuals were included, of whom 84.3 % started bictegravir, 7.2 % dolutegravir, 6.6 % efavirenz, and 1.8 % raltegravir. The adjusted probability of viral suppression at 3 months was 79.4 % (79.4 %, 80.2 %) with bictegravir, 78.5 % (76.2 %, 81.1 %) with dolutegravir, 63.9 % (60.6 %, 67.7 %) with efavirenz, and 69.8 % (63.8 %, 76.1 %) with raltegravir. When compared with bictegravir, this resulted in differences of -0.8 % (-3.5 %, 1.9 %) for dolutegravir, -15.5 % (-19 %, -11.7 %) for efavirenz, and -9.6 % (-15.9 %, -3.3 %) for raltegravir. Differences shrank at twelve months and with a higher viral threshold (200 copies/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Bictegravir was similar to dolutegravir and slightly more effective than efavirenz or raltegravir at three months, but differences became negligible at twelve months.","Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

34153099,"BACKGROUND: Early convalescent plasma transfusion may reduce mortality in  patients with nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This study emulates a (hypothetical) target trial using observational data from a cohort of US veterans admitted to a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility between 1 May and 17 November 2020 with nonsevere COVID-19. The intervention was convalescent plasma initiated within 2 days of eligibility. Thirty-day mortality was compared using cumulative incidence curves, risk differences, and hazard ratios estimated from pooled logistic models with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: Of 11 269 eligible person-trials contributed by 4755 patients, 402 trials were assigned to the convalescent plasma group. Forty and 671 deaths occurred within the plasma and nonplasma groups, respectively. The estimated 30-day mortality risk was 6.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0%-9.7%) in the plasma group and 6.2% (95% CI, 5.6%-7.0%) in the nonplasma group. The associated risk difference was 0.30% (95% CI, -2.30% to 3.60%) and the hazard ratio was 1.04 (95% CI, .64-1.62). CONCLUSIONS: Our target trial emulation estimated no meaningful differences in 30-day mortality between nonsevere COVID-19 patients treated and untreated with convalescent plasma.

40493366,"IMPORTANCE: Current guidelines recommend oseltamivir treatment for all patients  hospitalized with influenza, but this guidance is based on suboptimal evidence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes associated with oseltamivir treatment when compared with supportive care for severe seasonal influenza requiring hospitalization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation included adult patients admitted to hospital with influenza from 30 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 2015 to June 2023. Data were analyzed from November 2024 to March 2025. EXPOSURE: Oseltamivir treatment on hospital day 0 or 1 vs supportive care without oseltamivir. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included time to being discharged alive and readmission within 30 days. Overlap weighting of propensity scores was used to balance covariates, and a competing risk model was used to compare time to being discharged alive. RESULTS: Of 11 073 patients (mean [SD] age, 72.6 [16.8] years; 5793 female [52.3%]), there were 7632 patients (68.9%) and 3441 patients (31.1%) in the oseltamivir and supportive care groups, respectively. In hospital, 268 patients (3.5%) and 168 patients (4.9%) in the oseltamivir and supportive care groups died, respectively, with an adjusted risk difference of -1.8% (95% CI, -2.8% to -0.9%; P < .001). The oseltamivir treatment group was more likely to be discharged alive (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.25; P < .001). After discharge, 645 patients (8.5%) and 336 patients (9.8%) were readmitted in the oseltamivir and supportive care groups, respectively, with an adjusted risk difference of -1.5% (95% CI, -2.8% to -0.2%; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with influenza, oseltamivir treatment was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality risk, earlier discharge, and lower readmission rate, supporting evidence for the current guideline recommendation of oseltamivir treatment for severe influenza.

39290574,"INTRODUCTION: Depressive symptoms are linked with pain, anxiety, and substance  use. Research estimating whether a reduction in depressive symptoms is linked to subsequent reductions in pain and anxiety symptoms and substance use is limited. METHODS: Using data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, a multisite observational study of U.S. veterans, the authors used a target trial emulation framework to compare individuals with elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥ 10) who experienced reductions in depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score < 10) with those whose symptoms persisted (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥ 10) at the next follow-up visit (on average, 1 year later). Using inverse probability of treatment weighting, the authors estimated ORs and 95% CIs for associations between depressive symptom reduction status and improvement on the following: anxiety symptoms, pain symptoms, unhealthy alcohol use, and use of tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, and/or illicit opioids. RESULTS: Reductions in depressive symptoms were associated with reductions in pain symptoms (OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.01, 2.02), anxiety symptoms (OR=2.50, 95% CI=1.63, 3.83), and illicit opioid use (OR=2.07, 95% CI=1.13, 3.81). Depressive symptom reductions were not associated with reductions in unhealthy alcohol use (OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.48, 1.52) or use of tobacco (OR=1.49, 95% CI=0.89, 2.48), cannabis (OR=1.07, 95% CI=0.63, 1.83), or cocaine (OR=1.28, 95% CI=0.73, 2.24). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing depressive symptoms may potentially reduce pain and anxiety symptoms and illicit opioid use. Future work should determine whether reductions achieved through antidepressant medications, behavioral therapy, or other means have comparable impact.","Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine,  New York, New York.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University School of  Medicine, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine,  New York, New York.; Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine,  New York, New York.; Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine,  New York, New York.; Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine,  New York, New York.; Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine,  New York, New York.; Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health and Health Professions &  College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.; Center for Health Services Research, Institute for Health, Rutgers University,  New Brunswick, New Jersey.; Informatics, Decision-Enhancement, and Analytic Sciences (IDEAS) Center of  Innovation, VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, Utah.; Program for Addiction Research, Clinical Care, Knowledge and Advocacy (PARCKA),  Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah.; Department of Epidemiology, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence,  Rhode Island.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, New  Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine,  New York, New York.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.",S2773-0654(24)00076-2 [pii]; 100258 [pii]; 10.1016/j.focus.2024.100258 [doi],Khan MR; Acri M; Ban KF; Scheidell JD; Stevens ER; Manandhar-Sasaki P; Charles D; Chichetto NE; Crystal S; Gordon AJ; Marshall BDL; Edelman EJ; Justice AC; Braithwaite SR; Caniglia EC,,© 2024 Published by Elsevier Inc.,,,,,2024/09/18 04:30,,20240706,2024 Oct,2024/09/18 06:42,,,"Khan, Maria R; Acri, Mary; Ban, Kaoon Francois; Scheidell, Joy D; Stevens, Elizabeth R; Manandhar-Sasaki, Prima; Charles, Dyanna; Chichetto, Natalie E; Crystal, Stephen; Gordon, Adam J; Marshall, Brandon D L; Edelman, E Jennifer; Justice, Amy C; Braithwaite, Scott R; Caniglia, Ellen C",,UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States; R01 AA024706/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States; U10 AA013566/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States; U01 AA020790/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States; U24 AA020794/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States,5,,2773-0654,2773-0654,,9918487585606676,AJPM focus,eng,10.1016/j.focus.2024.100258 [doi]; 100258,20250311,,2024/09/18 06:43,,,,Unhealthy alcohol use; chronic pain; psychiatric conditions; substance use,NOTNLM,NLM,100258,,2024/09/18 04:30,2024/09/18 06:43,,2024/07/06 00:00,2024/09/18 06:42,,United States,PMC11407062,2024/07/06,epublish,Journal Article,,,,AJPM Focus. 2024 Jul 6;3(5):100258. doi: 10.1016/j.focus.2024.100258. eCollection  2024 Oct.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,AJPM Focus,Associations Between Reductions in Depressive Symptoms and Reductions in Pain and  Anxiety Symptoms and Substance Use: Emulation of a Randomized Trial.,,,,3
39510406,"BACKGROUND: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may experience  insomnia and use hypnotics. However, the effect of the use of hypnotics on their clinical course remains unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the use of hypnotics associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with IPF? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included 99 patients with IPF from the Hamamatsu hospital-based cohort and 123 patients with IPF from the Seirei hospital-based cohort, as well as 30,218 patients with IPF from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (the NDB cohort). To analyze the association of hypnotics use with outcomes avoiding immortal time bias, multivariable Cox models with time-dependent covariates and target trial emulation with a new user design were used for the hospital- and NDB-based cohorts. RESULTS: In the cohorts studied, the 3-year cumulative incidence of new use of hypnotics following the IPF diagnosis ranged from 13.4% to 24.1%. In both hospital-based cohorts, the continuous use of hypnotics was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and disease progression. In the NDB cohort, the continuous use of hypnotics was also associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Subgroup analysis found associations between the continuous use of hypnotics and increased mortality regardless of sex and comorbidities, excluding certain subpopulations. INTERPRETATION: This study found that continuous use of hypnotics was associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with IPF. Given the relatively high cumulative incidence of hypnotics use in this population, there is an urgent need to reassess the appropriate use of hypnotics for patients with IPF.","Second Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of  Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.

39183812,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of switching to bictegravir  in maintaining an undetectable viral load (<50 copies/mL) among people with HIV (PWH) as compared with continuing dolutegravir-, efavirenz-, or raltegravir-based antiretroviral therapy using nationwide observational data from Mexico. METHODS: We emulated 3 target trials comparing switching to bictegravir vs continuing with dolutegravir, efavirenz, or raltegravir. Eligibility criteria were PWH aged ≥16 years with a viral load <50 copies/mL and at least 3 months of current antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir, efavirenz, or raltegravir) between July 2019 and September 2021. Weekly target trials were emulated during the study period, and individuals were included in every emulation if they continued to be eligible. The main outcome was the probability of an undetectable viral load at 3 months, which was estimated via an adjusted logistic regression model. Estimated probabilities were compared via differences, and 95% CIs were calculated via bootstrap. Outcomes were also ascertained at 12 months, and sensitivity analyses were performed to test our analytic choices. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 3 028 619 PWH (63 581 unique individuals). The probability of an undetectable viral load at 3 months was 2.9% (95% CI, 1.9%-3.8%), 1.3% (95% CI, .9%-1.6%), and 1.2% (95% CI, .8%-1.7%) higher when switching to bictegravir vs continuing with dolutegravir, efavirenz, and raltegravir, respectively. Similar results were observed at 12 months and in other sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that switching to bictegravir could be more effective in maintaining viral suppression than continuing with dolutegravir, efavirenz, or raltegravir.","Department of Medical Education, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y  Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.; Division of Postgraduate Studies, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional  Autónoma de México, Mexico City, Mexico.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y  Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; High Specialty Regional Hospital Bajio, Health Secretariat, León, Mexico.; Consorcio de Investigación en Salud, Cuernavaca, Mexico.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.",ofae446 [pii]; 10.1093/ofid/ofae446 [doi],Núñez I; Caro-Vega Y; MacDonald C; Mosqueda-Gómez JL; Piñeirúa-Menéndez A; Matthews AA,ORCID: 0000-0001-8859-9115; ORCID: 0000-0002-4989-803X; ORCID: 0000-0002-1290-271X,© The Author(s) 2024.

39970192,"OBJECTIVE: People with HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection need  antiretroviral treatment (ART) to suppress HIV and direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to cure HCV. ART is typically prioritized, but delays in DAA initiation may increase the risk of liver-related events and HCV transmission to others. DESIGN: Target trial emulation with observational data collected in routine clinical practice from a collaboration of cohorts from Europe and North America. METHODS: We included DAA-naive adults with HIV-HCV co-infection who achieved HIV virologic suppression (HIV RNA <50 copies/ml) after starting ART between 2013 and 2020. We estimated the probability of not initiating DAAs at 6 and 36 months after HIV virologic suppression and emulated a target trial of early (≤6 months after HIV virological suppression) versus delayed (>6 months) DAA initiation and the 36-month risk of liver-related events (liver decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma). RESULTS: Of 862 eligible individuals (median age 46 years; interquartile range 36-56), 14% were women, and 52% had a history of injection drug use. The 6-month and 36-month probabilities of not initiating DAA were 58% [95% confidence interval (CI): 55-61] and 24% (21-27), respectively. The 36-month risk of liver-related events was 1.1% (0.4-2.0) for early initiation and 1.7% (0.7-2.5) for delayed initiation; risk difference -0.5% (-1.2 to 0.4). CONCLUSION: Almost one-quarter of people with HIV-HCV co-infection on ART had not initiated DAA 3 years after HIV virologic suppression. Because the 3-year risk of liver-related events was low, estimates of the impact of delayed DAA initiation were imprecise.","CAUSALab, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health,  Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.; CAUSALab, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health,  Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.; Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, liSGM.; CIBERINFEC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid.; Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, liSGM.; Infectious Diseases Service, Hospital Clínic-IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona,  Barcelona, Spain.; Division of Infectious Diseases and Chronic Viral Illness Service, Department of  Medicine, McGill University Health Centre.; Division of Infectious Diseases and Chronic Viral Illness Service, Department of  Medicine, McGill University Health Centre.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill  University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Medicine.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Center for Clinical  Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Center for Pharmacoepidemiology Research and Training, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven.; VA Connecticut Healthcare System, US Department of Veterans Affairs, West Haven,  CT, USA.; Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Southern Alberta Clinic and Department of Medicine, University of Calgary,  Calgary, AB, Canada.; Boston Medical Center.; Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Boston Medical Center.; Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Dermatology, Venereology, and Allergy, Medical University  Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital,  University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital,  University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology, & Medical Statistics.; 4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University General Hospital, Medical  School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.; University of Bordeaux, INSERM, Bordeaux Population Health-U1219, CIC1401-EC,  Bordeaux.; SISTM, INRIA, Talence.; CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux University Hospital, Service d'information médicale,  INSERM, CIC-EC 1401, Bordeaux, France.; Stichting HIV Monitoring.; Amsterdam UMC, location University of Amsterdam, Department of Infectious  Diseases and Amsterdam Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Stichting HIV Monitoring.; Amsterdam UMC, location University of Amsterdam, Department of Infectious  Diseases and Amsterdam Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; University of Bordeaux, INSERM, Bordeaux Population Health-U1219, CIC1401-EC,  Bordeaux.; Icona Foundation, Milan, Italy.; CAUSALab, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health,  Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.; CAUSALab, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health,  Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.; CAUSALab, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health,  Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, Harvard  University, Boston.; CAUSALab, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health,  Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.",00002030-202507010-00017 [pii]; 10.1097/QAD.0000000000004161 [doi],Chalouni M; Van Santen DK; Berenguer J; Jarrin I; Miro JM; Klein MB; Young J; Torgersen J; Rentsch CT; Gill MJ; Epstein RL; Linas B; Zangerle R; Surial B; Rauch A; Touloumi G; Papadopoulos A; Wittkop L; Van Der Valk M; Boyd A; Monforte AD; Puoti M; Logan RW; Rein SM; Hernán MA; Lodi S,,"Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

39761587,"BACKGROUND: The evidence informing the harms of gabapentin use are at risk of  bias from comparing users with nonusers. OBJECTIVE: To describe the risk for fall-related outcomes in older adults starting treatment with gabapentin versus duloxetine. DESIGN: New user, active comparator study using a target trial emulation framework. SETTING: MarketScan (IBM) commercial claims between January 2014 and December 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years or older with diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, or fibromyalgia and without depression, anxiety, seizures, or cancer in the 365 days before cohort entry. INTERVENTION: New initiation of treatment with gabapentin or duloxetine (comparator). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the hazard of experiencing any fall-related visit in the 6 months after initiating gabapentin or duloxetine until discontinuation of treatment. Secondary outcomes were hazard of severe fall-related events defined as a fall associated with hip fracture or emergency department visit or hospitalization associated with a fall. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Our analytic cohort included 57 086 older adults with a diagnosis of interest initiating treatment with gabapentin (n = 52 152) or duloxetine (n = 4934). Overall median follow-up duration was 30 days (IQR, 30 to 90 days). Weighted cumulative incidence of a fall-related visit per 1000 person-years at 30, 90, and 180 days was 103.60, 90.44, and 84.44 for gabapentin users and 203.43, 177.73, and 158.21 for duloxetine users, respectively. At 6-month follow-up, incident gabapentin users had lower hazard of falls (hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64]), but there was no difference in the hazards of experiencing severe falls.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to provide an overview of the literature on sequential analysis of electronic healthcare data and describe the development and testing of a novel epidemiological surveillance system. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library applying similar in- and exclusion criteria as those of a previous systematic review. The proposed system consisted of repeated cohort studies and was tested in an emulated prospective setting. Two signal evaluations were performed with several sensitivity analyses and a target trial emulation. FINDINGS: In the literature, 11 studies analysed the data sequentially of which two applied traditional epidemiological methods. Epidemiological surveillance of several exposures and outcomes can be successfully conducted with the newly proposed sequential analysis of electronic healthcare data. Signal evaluation studies confirmed the results of the system. CONCLUSIONS: Very few studies in the literature analysed data at multiple time points, although this seems to be a prerequisite for testing the methods in a realistic setting. We demonstrated the feasibility of a sequential surveillance system using electronic healthcare data.","Pharmacovigilance Research Center, Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology,  University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Division of  Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.; Pharmacovigilance Research Center, Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology,  University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",10.1111/bcpt.13955 [doi],Aakjaer M; De Bruin ML; Andersen M,ORCID: 0000-0002-6381-6715; ORCID: 0000-0001-9197-7068; ORCID: 0000-0001-7029-2860,© 2023 The Authors.

37921423,"BACKGROUND: While the benefits of levothyroxine are well-established for overt  hypothyroidism, they are unclear for subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) among pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of initiation of levothyroxine on pregnancy loss among women with SCH with an emulated target trial using observational data. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to account for the staggered timing of diagnosis and treatment of SCH and the time of entry of women into prenatal care. We emulated multiple nested trials (at each gestational week) and used an intention-to-treat approach to define levothyroxine use (≥1 prescription in the 7 days prior to trial entry), with eligible users matched to non-users (1:4) on time of diagnosis, gestational week of the first eligible trial and high-dimensional propensity score. Pregnancy losses included spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. A pooled logistic regression model with bootstrap resampling was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Based on 159,177 eligible person-trials (5781 women), the matched cohort included 181 initiators and 640 non-initiators of levothyroxine, with 57 pregnancy losses occurring during follow-up. Overall, the mean age of women was 32.2 years (SD 5.4), 25% were obese, 8% had type 2 diabetes and about 50% were nulliparous. After matching, women who initiated levothyroxine versus not had higher thyroid-stimulating levels during pregnancy and were more likely to have a history of hypothyroidism. The cumulative incidence of pregnancy loss was lower in initiators versus non-initiators of levothyroxine. The adjusted HR for pregnancy loss was 0.87 (95% CI 0.22, 1.56). CONCLUSIONS: Although our assessment of the effect of initiation of levothyroxine for SCH in pregnancy precludes any definitive conclusions due to wide confidence intervals, this study illustrates the feasibility of using the target trial emulation framework to examine the effectiveness of medication use in pregnancy.","Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.; Division of Epidemiology, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of  Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Population Health Science, School of Public Health, Georgia State  University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill  University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Pediatrics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Division of Endocrinology, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital,  Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill  University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.",10.1111/ppe.13015 [doi],Grandi SM; Yu YH; Reynier P; Platt RW; Yu OHY; Filion KB,ORCID: 0000-0002-8576-7854; ORCID: 0000-0002-5981-8443; ORCID: 0000-0003-4877-557X; ORCID: 0000-0001-6055-0088,© 2023 The Authors.

40067038,"Estimating effects of interventions is a central task in perioperative and  critical care outcomes research. While randomized trials remain the accepted standard for causal inference, trial data are not always available to inform clinical decisions, and some questions cannot be answered feasibly or efficiently with trials. In these settings, studies using observational healthcare data may be used to inform practice. Causal inference from observational data has been reconsidered in recent years, challenging the prevailing notion among clinical researchers that causal conclusions cannot be drawn from observational studies. The ""target trial framework"" is one contribution within a growing methodologic field that helps investigators avoid common pitfalls in observational study design and analysis. Importantly, researchers must understand which biases this framework can-and cannot-help avoid.

40057220,"BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial injury is defined by elevated cardiac troponin  levels with a rising and/or falling pattern, and is associated with increased mortality risk compared to patients without myocardial injury. The role of β-blockers in patients with acute myocardial injury remains unclear. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study used data from the Tianjin Health and Medical Data Platform to assess the impact of early β-blocker use on 1-year all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in acute myocardial injury patients, employing a new user and target trial emulation design. Propensity score matching was applied, and Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: After propensity score matching, a total of 25,966 participants were included: 8667 to the β-blocker group and 17,299 to the non-β-blocker group. A total of 4113 deaths (15.8%) and 5795 MACE (22.3%) occurred. Compared with nonusers, β-blocker was associated with the reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.95) and MACE (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85-0.95). In the subgroup analysis, β-blockers were associated with a significantly reduced risk of mortality in patients without stroke (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.93), while no significant association was observed in patients with stroke (HR 1.04, 95% CI: 0.93-1.16). CONCLUSIONS: Early use of β-blockers is associated with the reduced risk of 1-year mortality in patients with acute myocardial injury. To more accurately assess the therapeutic effects, prospective trials are necessary, and these data provide key research directions for future trials.","Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.; Yong Loo-Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore,  Singapore; Department of Cardiology, National University Heart Centre, Singapore, Singapore.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin,  China.

38733447,"Trial emulations in observational data analyses can complement findings from  randomized clinical trials, inform future trial designs, or generate evidence when randomized studies are not feasible due to resource constraints and ethical or practical limitations. Importantly, trial emulation designs facilitate causal inference in observational data analyses by enhancing counterfactual thinking and comparisons of real-world observations (e.g. Mendelian Randomization) to hypothetical interventions. In order to enhance credibility, trial emulations would benefit from prospective registration, publication of statistical analysis plans, and subsequent prospective benchmarking to randomized clinical trials prior to their publication. Confounding by indication, however, is the key challenge to interpreting observed intended effects of an intervention as causal in observational data analyses. We discuss the target trial emulation of the REDUCE-AMI randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03278509; beta-blocker use in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction after myocardial infarction) to illustrate the challenges and uncertainties of studying intended effects of interventions without randomization to account for confounding. We furthermore directly compare the findings, statistical power, and clinical interpretation of the results of the REDUCE-AMI target trial emulation to those from the simultaneously published randomized clinical trial. The complexity and subtlety of confounding by indication when studying intended effects of interventions can generally only be addressed by randomization.","Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC - University Medical Center Rotterdam,  Rotterdam, Netherlands. m.leening@erasmusmc.nl.; Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Cardiology, Erasmus MC - University  Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands. m.leening@erasmusmc.nl.; Department of Radiology, Erasmus MC - University Medical Center Rotterdam,  Rotterdam, Netherlands. m.leening@erasmusmc.nl.; Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Cardiology, Erasmus MC - University  Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",10.1007/s10654-024-01127-3 [pii]; 10.1007/s10654-024-01127-3 [doi],Leening MJG; Boersma E,ORCID: 0000-0002-4143-4839,© 2024.

40097035,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many men with cirrhosis have low testosterone levels. This is  associated with sarcopenia, anemia, and poor quality of life. Data are lacking, however, regarding the clinical impact of testosterone replacement. METHODS: We conducted an emulated clinical trial evaluating the impact of testosterone replacement among men who were diagnosed with hypogonadism at the same time as their diagnosis of cirrhosis (new user design). We used nationally representative Medicare data (2008-2020) to examine the risk of death, decompensation events, and fractures in patients who did or did not receive testosterone. We balanced treated and untreated with inverse probability of treatment weighting and evaluated outcomes using an intention-to-treat design. RESULTS: A total of 282 patients (7.4%) with testicular hypofunction and cirrhosis received testosterone replacement after diagnosis. Patients started on testosterone spent 28.6% of patient-days on therapy, and patients not started would spend 0.5% of patient-days on therapy (P < .0001). Testosterone use was associated with lower mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.99). Testosterone also led to a lower risk of new decompensation events (sHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99) and especially for ascites requiring paracentesis (sHR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.89) and variceal hemorrhage (sHR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.85) with less effect on hepatic encephalopathy requiring hospitalization (sHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84-1.01) and fractures (sHR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91-1.08) and without increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (sHR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.91-1.3). There was substantial heterogeneity of treatment effect across baseline subgroups. CONCLUSION: In our target trial emulation of a nationally representative cohort of older patients with cirrhosis and hypogonadism, testosterone use improved clinical outcomes.","Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,  Michigan.

39061155,"This manuscript examines the synergistic potential of prospective real-world/time  data/evidence (RWTD/E) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to enrich healthcare research and operational insights, with a particular focus on its impact within the sarcoma field. Through exploring RWTD/E's capability to provide real-world/time, granular patient data, it offers an enriched perspective on healthcare outcomes and delivery, notably in the complex arena of sarcoma care. Highlighting the complementarity between RWTD/E's expansive real-world/time scope and the structured environment of RCTs, this paper showcases their combined strength, which can help to foster advancements in personalized medicine and population health management, exemplified through the lens of sarcoma treatment. The manuscript further outlines methodological innovations such as target trial emulation and their significance in enhancing the precision and applicability of RWTD/E, underscoring the transformative potential of these advancements in sarcoma care and beyond.

40631395,"Sequential trial emulation (STE) is an approach to estimating causal treatment  effects by emulating a sequence of target trials from observational data. In STE, inverse probability weighting is commonly utilised to address time-varying confounding and/or dependent censoring. Then structural models for potential outcomes are applied to the weighted data to estimate treatment effects. For inference, the simple sandwich variance estimator is popular but conservative, while nonparametric bootstrap is computationally expensive, and a more efficient alternative, linearised estimating function (LEF) bootstrap, has not been adapted to STE. We evaluated the performance of various methods for constructing confidence intervals (CIs) of marginal risk differences in STE with survival outcomes by comparing the coverage of CIs based on nonparametric/LEF bootstrap, jackknife, and the sandwich variance estimator through simulations. LEF bootstrap CIs demonstrated better coverage than nonparametric bootstrap CIs and sandwich-variance-estimator-based CIs with small/moderate sample sizes, low event rates and low treatment prevalence, which were the motivating scenarios for STE. They were less affected by treatment group imbalance and faster to compute than nonparametric bootstrap CIs. With large sample sizes and medium/high event rates, the sandwich-variance-estimator-based CIs had the best coverage and were the fastest to compute. These findings offer guidance in constructing CIs in causal survival analysis using STE.","MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, UK.; MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, UK.; MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, UK.",10.1177/09622802251356594 [doi],Limozin JM; Seaman SR; Su L,ORCID: 0000-0002-1140-2350; ORCID: 0000-0003-3726-5937; ORCID: 0000-0003-0919-3462,,,,,,2025/07/09 05:23,,20250709,2025 Jul 9,2025/07/09 06:27,,,"Limozin, Juliette M; Seaman, Shaun R; Su, Li",,,,,1477-0334,0962-2802,,9212457,Statistical methods in medical research,eng,10.1177/09622802251356594 [doi],20250709,,2025/07/09 06:27,,,,Causal inference; confidence intervals; inverse probability weighting; marginal structural models; survival analysis; target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,9622802251356594,,2025/07/09 05:23,2025/07/09 06:27,,,2025/07/09 06:27,,England,,,aheadofprint,Journal Article,,IM,,Stat Methods Med Res. 2025 Jul 9:9622802251356594. doi:  10.1177/09622802251356594.,Publisher,Stat Methods Med Res,"Inference procedures in sequential trial emulation with survival outcomes:  Comparing confidence intervals based on the sandwich variance estimator, bootstrap and jackknife.",,,,
38639831,"BACKGROUND: Early trials of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DCCBs)  suggest a detrimental effect on intraglomerular pressure and an association with albuminuria. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the associations of DCCB initiation with albuminuria and kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) and to determine whether renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade modified these associations. DESIGN: We conducted a target trial emulation study using a new user, active comparator design and electronic health record data from Geisinger Health. PARTICIPANTS: We included patients without severe albuminuria or KFRT who were initiated on a DCCB or thiazide (active comparator) between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Using inverse probability of treatment weighting, we performed doubly robust Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the association of DCCB initiation with incident severe albuminuria (urine albumin to creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g) and KFRT, overall and stratified by RAS blocker use. KEY RESULTS: There were 11,747 and 26,758 eligible patients initiating a DCCB and thiazide, respectively, with a weighted baseline mean age of 60 years, systolic blood pressure of 143 mm Hg, and eGFR of 86 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and with a mean follow-up of 8 years. Compared with thiazides, DCCBs were significantly associated with the development of severe albuminuria (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.43), with attenuation of risk in the presence of RAS blockade (P for interaction < 0.001). The risk of KFRT was increased among patients without RAS blockade (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.19-2.31), but not with RAS blockade (P for interaction = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: DCCBs were associated with increased risk of albuminuria and, in the absence of RAS blockade, KFRT. These findings suggest coupling DCCB therapy with RAS blockade may mitigate adverse kidney outcomes.","Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine and Public  Health, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA. mblum@medicine.wisc.edu.; Division of Precision Medicine, Department of Medicine, New York University  Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health, Danville, PA, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; San Francisco VA Health Care System, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins  University, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins  University, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  Baltimore, MD, USA.; Division of Precision Medicine, Department of Medicine, New York University  Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins  University, Baltimore, MD, USA.",10.1007/s11606-024-08762-2 [pii]; 8762 [pii]; 10.1007/s11606-024-08762-2 [doi],Blum MF; Surapaneni A; Chang A; Inker LA; Chen TK; Appel LJ; Shin JI; Grams ME,ORCID: 0000-0003-4357-6926,"© 2024.

37878310,"IMPORTANCE: Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm have a high risk of ischemic  events associated with concomitant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and current clinical practice guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy to mitigate this risk. However, in patients with aneurysms without symptomatic atherosclerosis, the benefit of antiplatelet therapy has been sparsely investigated. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of antiplatelets on the risk of ischemic events and bleeding in individuals with abdominal aneurysms with no symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A comparative effectiveness research study using a target trial emulation framework was performed. Population-based, cross-linked observational data from Danish national health registries containing comprehensive, individual-level information on all Danish citizens were used to evaluate patients who were antiplatelet-naive and diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms, with no record of symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease, from January 1, 2010, through August 21, 2021. EXPOSURE: Prescription filled for aspirin or clopidogrel. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of ischemic events (myocardial infarction and/or ischemic stroke) and risk of major bleeding. For target trial emulation, trials were emulated as sequential, contingent on patient eligibility at the time of inclusion, and were evaluated by means of pooled logistic regression models to estimate the intention-to-treat and as-treated effects, expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and event-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 6344 patients (65.2% men; age, 72 [IQR, 64-78] years) provided 131 047 trial cases; 3363 of these cases involved initiation of antiplatelet therapy and 127 684 did not. A total of 182 ischemic events occurred among initiators and 5602 ischemic events occurred among noninitiators, corresponding to an intention-to-treat HR of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.73-1.17) and an estimated absolute event-free survival difference of -0.6% (95% CI, -1.7% to 0.5%). After censoring nonadherent person-time, the treatment HR was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.68-1.20), with similar risk difference. For bleeding, the intention-to-treat HR was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.97-1.58) and the event-free survival difference was 1.0%. The treatment HR was 1.21 (95% CI, 0.82-1.72); the risk difference was similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, no evidence of effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy to lower the risk of ischemic events and a trend toward higher bleeding risk was noted. The observed differences between the treatment groups were minimal, suggesting limited clinical relevance of antiplatelet treatment.","Department of Cardiology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Aalborg Thrombosis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of  Health, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Vascular Surgery, Viborg Regional Hospital, Viborg, Denmark.; Department of Cardiology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Aalborg Thrombosis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of  Health, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Cardiology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Department of Vascular Surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Cardiology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Aalborg Thrombosis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of  Health, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Thrombosis Research Group, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and  Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Asklepios Medical School,  Asklepios Clinic Wandsbek, Hamburg, Germany.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brandenburg Medical School Theodor Fontane,  Neuruppin, Germany.; Department of Cardiology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.; Aalborg Thrombosis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of  Health, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.",2810995 [pii]; zoi231158 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.39715 [doi],Nicolajsen CW; Søgaard M; Jensen M; Eldrup N; Larsen TB; Goldhaber SZ; Behrendt CA; Nielsen PB,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Søgaard reported receiving personal fees  from Bayer AG for consulting outside the submitted work.

33263718,"IMPORTANCE: Treatments for psoriasis may be less effective in everyday practice  than in clinical trials. Emulating a target trial using data from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register (BADBIR) can provide treatment effect estimates that are robust and can inform both clinicians and regulatory bodies. OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative effectiveness of ustekinumab and secukinumab in patients with psoriasis, and to test whether the relative effectiveness estimate of the CLEAR trial, a randomized clinical trial that compared secukinumab with ustekinumab for psoriasis, can be replicated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness research study used a target trial emulation approach and was performed between November 2007 and August 2019. Data were obtained from BADBIR, a multicenter longitudinal pharmacovigilance register of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. Participants had chronic plaque psoriasis, were 18 years or older, and had at least 1 record of a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 12 or higher before their initiation to secukinumab or ustekinumab. Propensity score (PS) 1:1 matched analysis and inverse probability treatment weighted analysis were performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the risk ratio (RR) and the risk difference (RD) for achieving PASI of 2 or lower after 12 months of therapy for secukinumab compared with ustekinumab. Methods to account for missing outcome data were complete case analysis, nonresponder imputation, last observation carried forward, inverse probability of censoring weighting, and multiple imputation. Regulatory and estimate agreement metrics were used to benchmark the effect estimates in this study against those in the CLEAR trial. RESULTS: A total of 1231 patients were included in the analysis, with 917 receiving ustekinumab and 314 receiving secukinumab. Secukinumab was superior to ustekinumab in all analyses, except under the nonresponder imputation method, in the proportion of participants achieving a PASI of 2 or lower (PS-weighted complete case analysis: RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.06-1.55]; RD, 11.9% [1.6-22.1]). All analyses, except for nonresponder imputation, reached regulatory agreement in both PS-matching and PS-weighted analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This comparative effectiveness study found that secukinumab resulted in more patients achieving a PASI of 2 or lower after 12 months of therapy compared with ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis. Target trial emulation in this study resulted in regulatory and estimate agreement with the CLEAR randomized clinical trial; further such studies may help fill the evidence gap when comparing other systemic therapies for psoriasis.","Centre for Dermatology Research, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, The  University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Dermatology Research, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, The  University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Institute of Translational and Clinical Medicine, Newcastle University Medical  School, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.; Department of Dermatology, Royal Victoria Infirmary and NIHR Newcastle Biomedical  Research Centre, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.; Institute of Translational and Clinical Medicine, Newcastle University Medical  School, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.; Department of Dermatology, Royal Victoria Infirmary and NIHR Newcastle Biomedical  Research Centre, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.; St John's Institute of Dermatology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,  London, United Kingdom.; Versus Arthritis Centre for Epidemiology, The University of Manchester,  Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Dermatology Research, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, The  University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Dermatology Research, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, The  University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.",2773729 [pii]; doi200062 [pii]; 10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.4202 [doi],Yiu ZZN; Mason KJ; Hampton PJ; Reynolds NJ; Smith CH; Lunt M; Griffiths CEM; Warren RB,,,,BADBIR Study Group,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Mason reported receiving personal fees from  Janssen, LEO Pharma, Lilly, and Novartis outside the submitted work.

35680106,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in  reducing incidence of distal vs. proximal colorectal cancer (CRC) in persons aged 55-69 years. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using observational data from a German claims database (German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database), we emulated a target trial with two arms: Colonoscopy screening vs. no-screening at baseline. Adjusted cumulative incidence of total, distal, and proximal CRC over 11 years of follow-up was estimated in 55-69-year-olds at an average CRC risk and without colonoscopy, polypectomy, or fecal occult blood test before baseline. RESULTS: Overall, 307,158 persons were included (screening arm: 198,389 and control arm: 117,399). The adjusted 11-year risk of any CRC was 1.62% in the screening group and 2.38% in the no-screening group resulting in a relative risk of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.63-0.73). The relative risk was 0.67 for distal CRC (95% CI: 0.62-0.73) and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.63-0.79) for proximal CRC. The cumulative incidence curves of the groups crossed after 6.7 (distal CRC) and 5.0 years (proximal CRC). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that colonoscopy is effective in preventing distal and proximal CRC. Unlike previous studies not using a target trial approach, we found no relevant difference in the effectiveness by location.","Department of Biometry and Data Management, Leibniz Institute for Prevention  Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research  and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.; Department of Biometry and Data Management, Leibniz Institute for Prevention  Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.; Epidemiology and Screening Unit - CPO, University Hospital Città della Salute e  della Scienza, Turin, Italy.; Department of Biometry and Data Management, Leibniz Institute for Prevention  Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany; Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research  and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany; Faculty of Human and Health Sciences, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany.

34610282,"BACKGROUND: Stopping renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) after an episode  of hyperkalemia is common but may involve therapeutic compromises, in that the cessation of RASi deprives patients of their beneficial cardiovascular effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Observational study from the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project including patients initiating RASi in routine care and surviving a first-detected episode of hyperkalemia (potassium >5.0 mmol/L). We used target trial emulation techniques based on cloning, censoring and weighting to compare stopping vs. continuing RASi within 6 months after hyperkalemia. Outcomes were 3-year risks of mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke hospitalization) and recurrent hyperkalemia. Of 5669 new users of RASi who developed hyperkalemia (median age 72 years, 44% women), 1425 (25%) stopped RASi therapy within 6 months. Compared with continuing RASi, stopping therapy was associated with a higher 3-year risk of death (absolute risk difference 10.8%; HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.34-1.64) and MACE (risk difference 4.7%; HR 1.29, 1.14-1.45), but a lower risk of recurrent hyperkalemia (risk difference -9.5%; HR 0.76, 0.69-0.84). Results were consistent for events following potassium of >5.0 or >5.5 mmol/L, after censoring when the treatment decision was changed, across prespecified subgroups, and after adjusting for albuminuria. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that stopping RASi after hyperkalemia may be associated with a lower risk of recurrence of hyperkalemia, but higher risk of death and cardiovascular events.","Peking University Clinical Research Institute, Peking University First Hospital,  Beijing, China.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd  Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden.; Department of Medicine and Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster  University, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden..

40607703,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate outcomes associated with transcarotid artery  revascularization with flow reversal(TCAR) versus carotid endarterectomy(CEA) for carotid artery stenosis(CAS), emulating a randomized controlled trial. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The introduction of TCAR has revolutionized management of CAS. While this approach has been demonstrated to yield reduced morbidity relative to transfemoral carotid artery stenting, a comparison of outcomes with gold-standard CEA remains lacking. METHODS: We identified all records entailing CEA or TCAR for CAS within the 2021-2022 Nationwide Readmissions Database. We conducted a target trial emulation using doubly robust inverse probability-weighted regression analysis to evaluate the adjusted hazard of 90-day composite morbidity, comprised of in-hospital stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. Patients were further stratified as high- or low-risk based on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS) criteria. RESULTS: We identified 113,994 patients who received CEA, and 12,613 TCAR. The adjusted risk of composite morbidity over 90 days following revascularization was 4.1% (CI 3.6-4.6%) following TCAR compared with 4.1% (CI 4.0-4.3%) after CEA. The average treatment effect of TCAR was not found to be significant. Target trial emulation revealed TCAR to confer similar hazard of 90-day composite morbidity as CEA among low-risk patients (HR 0.85, CI 0.72-1.01), but reduced hazard of myocardial infarction among high-risk patients (HR 0.76, CI 0.58-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Upon target trial emulation, receipt of TCAR was associated with comparable morbidity over 90 days following revascularization, relative to CEA. Altogether, our data support recent CMS approval of TCAR, and encourage broadened utilization among both standard and high-risk patients.","Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Laboratories (CORELAB), University of  California, Los Angeles, CA.; Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Laboratories (CORELAB), University of  California, Los Angeles, CA.; Department of Surgery, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO.; Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Laboratories (CORELAB), University of  California, Los Angeles, CA.; Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Laboratories (CORELAB), University of  California, Los Angeles, CA.; Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Laboratories (CORELAB), University of  California, Los Angeles, CA.; Department of Surgery, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.; Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University  of California, San Diego, CA.; Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Laboratories (CORELAB), University of  California, Los Angeles, CA.; Department of Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California,  Los Angeles, CA.",00000658-990000000-01355 [pii]; 10.1097/SLA.0000000000006825 [doi],Sakowitz S; Vadlakonda A; Bakhtiyar SS; Sanaiha Y; Coaston T; deVirgilio C; Malas M; Benharash P,,"Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

39374677,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of early intensive in-hospital  rehabilitation, initiated within 2 days of surgery and lasting up to 7 days, on the recovery of activities of daily living in patients with and without dementia. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Medical claims data from 925 hospitals in Japan were analyzed. We enrolled patients aged ≥50 years who underwent hip fracture surgery within 2 days of admission between April 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. Low- (20 minutes per day starting on day 2), highest- (60 minutes per day starting on day 1), and gradually increasing (20 minutes on day 1, 40 minutes on days 2-4, and 60 minutes per day thereafter) intensity regimens were used as exposures. The outcomes were Barthel Index (BI) scores at 14 and 30 days postoperatively. For per-protocol analysis, a target trial emulation framework with the sequential doubly robust estimator was used. RESULTS: Among patients without dementia (N = 11,461), no significant differences in BI scores were observed at 14 days postoperatively across regimens. At 30 days postoperatively, significant differences in BI scores were noted between highest- and low-intensity regimens and between gradually increasing intensity and low-intensity regimens, with additive BI scores of 15.2 (95% CI, 10.7-19.7) and 14.7 (95% CI, 9.2-20.2), respectively. In patients with dementia (N = 14,302), significant differences in BI scores were noted at 14 days postoperatively between highest- and low-intensity regimens and between gradually increasing intensity and low-intensity regimens, with additive BI scores of 8.7 (95% CI, 5.2-12.2) and 10.7 (95% CI, 5.8-15.6), respectively. At 30 days postoperatively, a significant difference in BI scores was observed between gradually increasing intensity and low-intensity regimens, with an additive BI score of 17.9 (95% CI, 11.3-24.5). CONCLUSION: Early intensive in-hospital rehabilitation is highly relevant and beneficial for dementia patients.","Department of Health Policy Science, Graduate School of Medical Science, Yamagata  University, Yamagata, Japan; Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Fukuoka, Japan.

40147840,"AIMS: To assess and compare the risk of adverse renal events among patients with  diabetic macular oedema (DME) who were treated with either intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study and employed a target trial emulation framework using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database from 2011 to 2018.Patients aged over 20 years diagnosed with DME and receiving treatment with either intravitreal aflibercept or ranibizumab were included. We applied propensity score methods to ensure balance in the baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups. The primary outcomes were the adverse renal events, specifically acute renal injury and hospitalisation due to renal events. We employed Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the HRs associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 6330 patients receiving ranibizumab and 1258 patients receiving aflibercept were included in this study. The incidence rates of adverse renal events were 102.2 and 138.7 per 1000 person-years for ranibizumab and aflibercept, respectively. Patients treated with intravitreal aflibercept had a significantly higher risk of experiencing a composite of adverse renal events (HR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.63), compared with those treated with ranibizumab, and specifically also a higher risk of acute kidney injury (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.63) and hospitalisation due to renal events (HR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.25 to 1.64). CONCLUSION: In comparison to ranibizumab, the intravitreal use of aflibercept was associated with a greater risk of adverse renal events. These findings provide a solid foundation for future studies to validate these results further.","Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Ophthalmology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan edward_lai@mail.ncku.edu.tw.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.",bjo-2024-325509 [pii]; 10.1136/bjo-2024-325509 [doi],Lee WA; Shao SC; Hsieh MH; Liao TC; Lin SJ; Lai EC,ORCID: 0000-0002-9972-8899; ORCID: 0000-0003-4867-6686; ORCID: 0000-0002-5852-7652,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

37461492,"BACKGROUND: Though ischemic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of heart failure  (HF), most patients do not undergo coronary assessment after heart failure diagnosis. In a safety-net population, referral patterns have not been studied, and it is unknown whether coronary assessment is associated with improved HF outcomes. METHODS: Using an electronic health record cohort of all individuals with HF within San Francisco Health Network from 2001-2019, we identified factors associated with completion of coronary assessment (invasive coronary angiography, nuclear stress, or coronary computed tomographic angiography). Then we emulated a randomized clinical trial of elective coronary assessment with outcomes of all-cause mortality and a composite outcome of mortality and emergent angiography. We used propensity scores to account for differences between groups. We used national death records to improve ascertainment of mortality. RESULTS: Among 14,829 individuals with HF (median 62 years old, 5,855 [40%] women), 3,987 (26.9%) ever completed coronary assessment, with 2,467 (18.5%) assessed out of 13,301 with unknown CAD status at HF diagnosis. Women and older individuals were less likely to complete coronary assessment, with differences by race/ethnicity, medical history, substance use, housing, and echocardiographic findings. Among 5,972 eligible for inclusion in the ""target trial,"" 627 underwent early elective coronary assessment and 5,345 did not. Coronary assessment was associated with lower mortality (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72-0.97; p=0.025), reduced risk of the composite outcome, higher rates of revascularization, and higher use of medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a safety-net population, disparities in coronary assessment after HF diagnosis are not fully explained by CAD risk factors. Our target trial emulation suggests coronary assessment is associated with improved HF outcomes possibly related to higher rates of revascularization and GDMT use, but with low certainty that this is finding is not attributable to unmeasured confounding.","Division of Cardiology at ZSFG and Department of Medicine, University of  California, San Francisco (UCSF), USA.; Division of Cardiology at ZSFG and Department of Medicine, University of  California, San Francisco (UCSF), USA.; Division of Cardiology at ZSFG and Department of Medicine, University of  California, San Francisco (UCSF), USA.; Division of Cardiology at ZSFG and Department of Medicine, University of  California, San Francisco (UCSF), USA.; Division of Cardiology at ZSFG and Department of Medicine, University of  California, San Francisco (UCSF), USA.; Division of Cardiology at ZSFG and Department of Medicine, University of  California, San Francisco (UCSF), USA.",2023.07.06.23292331 [pii]; 10.1101/2023.07.06.23292331 [doi],Durstenfeld MS; Thakkar A; Ma Y; Zier LS; Davis JD; Hsue PY,,,,,Disclosures: None of the authors have pertinent disclosures or relevant conflicts  of interest.,,2023/07/18 03:37,,20230708,2023 Jul 8,2023/07/18 06:42,,,"Durstenfeld, Matthew S; Thakkar, Anjali; Ma, Yifei; Zier, Lucas S; Davis, Jonathan D; Hsue, Priscilla Y",,K12 HL143961/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; K24 AI112393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; UL1 TR001872/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States,,,,,,101767986,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,eng,2023.07.06.23292331 [pii]; 10.1101/2023.07.06.23292331 [doi],20241008,,2023/07/18 06:43,,,,angiography; coronary artery disease; disparities; heart failure; mortality,NOTNLM,NLM,,,2023/07/18 03:37,2023/07/18 06:43,,2023/07/16 00:00,2023/07/18 06:42,,United States,PMC10350143,2023/07/16,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,medRxiv [Preprint]. 2023 Jul 8:2023.07.06.23292331. doi:  10.1101/2023.07.06.23292331.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,medRxiv,Coronary Assessment in Heart Failure within a Safety-Net Setting: Disparities and  Outcomes.,,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2024 Jun;17(6):e010800. doi:  10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.123.010800.

38558212,"With an ever-increasing number of treatment options, the assessment of treatment  sequences has become crucial in health technology assessment (HTA). This review systematically explores the multifaceted challenges inherent in evaluating sequences, delving into their interplay and nuances that go beyond economic model structures. We synthesised a 'roadmap' of literature from key methodological studies, highlighting the evolution of recent advances and emerging research themes. These insights were compared against HTA guidelines to identify potential avenues for future research. Our findings reveal a spectrum of challenges in sequence evaluation, encompassing selecting appropriate decision-analytic modelling approaches and comparators, deriving appropriate clinical effectiveness evidence in the face of data scarcity, scrutinising effectiveness assumptions and statistical adjustments, considering treatment displacement, and optimising model computations. Integrating methodologies from diverse disciplines-statistics, epidemiology, causal inference, operational research and computer science-has demonstrated promise in addressing these challenges. An updated review of application studies is warranted to provide detailed insights into the extent and manner in which these methodologies have been implemented. Data scarcity on the effectiveness of treatment sequences emerged as a dominant concern, especially because treatment sequences are rarely compared in clinical trials. Real-world data (RWD) provide an alternative means for capturing evidence on effectiveness and future research should prioritise harnessing causal inference methods, particularly Target Trial Emulation, to evaluate treatment sequence effectiveness using RWD. This approach is also adaptable for analysing trials harbouring sequencing information and adjusting indirect comparisons when collating evidence from heterogeneous sources. Such investigative efforts could lend support to reviews of HTA recommendations and contribute to synthesising external control arms involving treatment sequences.","Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research (SCHARR), Division of Population  Health, School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, Regent Court, 30 Regent Street, Sheffield, S1 4DA, UK. jy.a.chang@sheffield.ac.uk.; Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research (SCHARR), Division of Population  Health, School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, Regent Court, 30 Regent Street, Sheffield, S1 4DA, UK.; Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research (SCHARR), Division of Population  Health, School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, Regent Court, 30 Regent Street, Sheffield, S1 4DA, UK.; Delta Hat Limited, Nottingham, UK.",10.1007/s40273-024-01363-1 [pii]; 10.1007/s40273-024-01363-1 [doi],Chang JA; Chilcott JB; Latimer NR,ORCID: 0000-0001-6660-5246; ORCID: 0000-0003-1231-7817; ORCID: 0000-0001-5304-5585,"© 2024.

38152625,"BACKGROUND: The real-world clinical effectiveness of sotrovimab in preventing  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related hospitalization or mortality among high-risk patients diagnosed with COVID-19, particularly after the emergence of the Omicron variant, needs further research. METHOD: Using data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system, we adopted a target trial emulation design in our study. Veterans aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 between December 1, 2021, and April 4, 2022, were included. Patients treated with sotrovimab (n = 2816) as part of routine clinical care were compared with all eligible but untreated patients (n = 11,250). Cox proportional hazards modeling estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between receipt of sotrovimab and outcomes. RESULTS: Most (90%) sotrovimab recipients were ≥50 years old, and 64% had ≥2 mRNA vaccine doses or ≥1 dose of Ad26.COV2. During the period that BA.1 was dominant, compared with patients not treated, sotrovimab-treated patients had a 70% lower risk of hospitalization or mortality within 30 days (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23-0.40). During BA.2 dominance, sotrovimab-treated patients had a 71% (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-0.98) lower risk of 30-day COVID-19-related hospitalization, emergency room visits, or urgent care visits (defined as severe COVID-19) compared with patients not treated. CONCLUSIONS: Using national real-world data from high-risk and predominantly vaccinated veterans, administration of sotrovimab, compared with contemporary standard treatment regimens, was associated with reduced risk of 30-day COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause mortality during the Omicron BA.1 period.","US Department of Veterans Affairs, PBM, Center for Medication Safety, Hines,  Illinois, USA.; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.; US Department of Veterans Affairs, PBM, Center for Medication Safety, Hines,  Illinois, USA.; White River Junction Veterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction,  Vermont.; US Department of Veterans Affairs, PBM, Center for Medication Safety, Hines,  Illinois, USA.; White River Junction Veterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction,  Vermont.; Vir Biotechnology, San Francisco, California, USA.; GSK, Brentford, Middlesex, UK.; Vir Biotechnology, San Francisco, California, USA.; Vir Biotechnology, San Francisco, California, USA.; US Department of Veterans Affairs, VA SHIELD, Veterans Affairs Northeast Ohio  Healthcare System, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Decatur, Georgia, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta,  Georgia, USA.; Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Decatur, Georgia, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta,  Georgia, USA.; Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University,  Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine,  Aurora, Colorado, USA.",ofad605 [pii]; 10.1093/ofid/ofad605 [doi],Young-Xu Y; Korves C; Zwain G; Satram S; Drysdale M; Reyes C; Cheng MM; Bonomo RA; Epstein L; Marconi VC; Ginde AA,ORCID: 0000-0002-3299-894X; ORCID: 0000-0002-1175-1112,Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of  America 2023.,,,"Potential conflicts of interest.

39745797,"Target trial emulation (TTE) is a popular framework for observational studies  based on electronic health records (EHR). A key component of this framework is determining the patient population eligible for inclusion in both a target trial of interest and its observational emulation. Missingness in variables that define eligibility criteria, however, presents a major challenge towards determining the eligible population when emulating a target trial with an observational study. In practice, patients with incomplete data are almost always excluded from analysis despite the possibility of selection bias, which can arise when subjects with observed eligibility data are fundamentally different than excluded subjects. Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, very little work has been done to mitigate this concern. In this paper, we propose a novel conceptual framework to address selection bias in TTE studies, tailored towards time-to-event endpoints, and describe estimation and inferential procedures via inverse probability weighting (IPW). Under an EHR-based simulation infrastructure, developed to reflect the complexity of EHR data, we characterize common settings under which missing eligibility data poses the threat of selection bias and investigate the ability of the proposed methods to address it. Finally, using EHR databases from Kaiser Permanente, we demonstrate the use of our method to evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on microvascular outcomes among a cohort of severely obese patients with Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).","Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

34276552,"Parkinson's disease covers a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from early  non-motor symptoms to the characteristic bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. Although differences in the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease are increasingly recognized, there is still a lack of insight into the heterogeneity of the pre-diagnostic phase of Parkinson's disease. In this perspective, we highlight three aspects regarding the role of population-based studies in providing new insights into the heterogeneity of pre-diagnostic Parkinson's disease. First we describe several specific advantages of population-based cohort studies, including the design which overcomes some common biases, the broad data collection and the high external validity. Second, we draw a parallel with the field of Alzheimer's disease to provide future directions to uncover the heterogeneity of pre-diagnostic Parkinson's disease. Finally, we anticipate on the emergence of prevention and disease-modification trials and the potential role of population-based studies herein. In the coming years, bridging gaps between study designs will be essential to make vital advances in elucidating the heterogeneity of pre-diagnostic Parkinson's disease.","Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam,  Netherlands.; Department of Neurology, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam,  Netherlands.; Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam,  Netherlands.; Department of Neurology, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam,  Netherlands.",10.3389/fneur.2021.702502 [doi],Dommershuijsen LJ; Boon AJW; Ikram MK,,"Copyright © 2021 Dommershuijsen, Boon and Ikram.",,,The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any  commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.,,2021/07/19 05:52,,20210701,2021,2021/07/20 06:00,,,"Dommershuijsen, Lisanne J; Boon, Agnita J W; Ikram, M Kamran",,,,,1664-2295,1664-2295,1664-2295,101546899,Frontiers in neurology,eng,10.3389/fneur.2021.702502 [doi]; 702502,20230920,,2021/07/20 06:01,,,,epidemiology; heterogeneity; population-based; pre-diagnostic Parkinson's disease; prediction; prevention trials; prodromal Parkinson's disease; target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,702502,2021/06/03 00:00,2021/07/19 05:52,2021/07/20 06:01,,2021/07/01 00:00,2021/07/20 06:00,2021/04/29 00:00,Switzerland,PMC8284316,2021/07/01,epublish,Journal Article,,,,Front Neurol. 2021 Jul 1;12:702502. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2021.702502. eCollection  2021.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Front Neurol,Probing the Pre-diagnostic Phase of Parkinson's Disease in Population-Based  Studies.,,,,12
37943228,"BACKGROUND: Women with cardiomyopathies are at risk for pregnancy complications.  The optimal mode of delivery in these patients is guided by expert opinion and limited small studies. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to examine the association of delivery mode with severe maternal morbidity events during delivery hospitalization and readmissions among patients with cardiomyopathies. METHODS: The Premier inpatient administrative database was used to conduct a retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients with a diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy. Utilizing a target trial emulation strategy, the primary analysis compared outcomes among patients exposed to intended vaginal delivery vs intended cesarean delivery (intention to treat). A secondary analysis compared outcomes among patients who delivered vaginally vs by cesarean (as-treated). Outcomes examined were nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity during the delivery hospitalization, blood transfusion, and readmission. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 2,921 deliveries. In the primary analysis (intention to treat), there was no difference in nontransfusion morbidity (adjusted OR [aOR]: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.91-1.51), blood transfusion (aOR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.81-1.98), or readmission (aOR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.73-1.44) between intended vaginal delivery and intended cesarean delivery. In the as-treated analysis, cesarean delivery was associated with a 2-fold higher risk of nontransfusion morbidity (aOR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.85-3.22) and blood transfusion (aOR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.34-3.81) when compared with vaginal delivery. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cardiomyopathies, a trial of labor does not confer a higher risk of maternal morbidity, blood transfusion, or readmission compared with planned cesarean delivery.","Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North  Carolina, USA.

39241824,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide an overview of analytical methods in  scientific literature for comparing uncontrolled medicine trials with external controls from individual patient data real-world data (IPD-RWD) and to compare these methods with recommendations made in guidelines from European regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) organizations and with their evaluations described in assessment reports. METHODS: A systematic literature review (until March 1, 2023) in PubMed and Connected Papers was performed to identify analytical methods for comparing uncontrolled trials with external controls from IPD-RWD. These methods were compared descriptively with methods recommended in method guidelines and encountered in assessment reports of the European Medicines Agency (2015-2020) and 4 European HTA organizations (2015-2023). RESULTS: Thirty-four identified scientific articles described analytical methods for comparing uncontrolled trial data with IPD-RWD-based external controls. The various methods covered controlling for confounding and/or dependent censoring, correction for missing data, and analytical comparative modeling methods. Seven guidelines also focused on research design, RWD quality, and transparency aspects, and 4 of those recommended analytical methods for comparisons with IPD-RWD. The methods discussed in regulatory (n = 15) and HTA (n = 35) assessment reports were often based on aggregate data and lacked transparency owing to the few details provided. CONCLUSIONS: Literature and guidelines suggest a methodological approach to comparing uncontrolled trials with external controls from IPD-RWD similar to target trial emulation, using state-of-the-art methods. External controls supporting regulatory and HTA decision making were rarely in line with this approach. Twelve recommendations are proposed to improve the quality and acceptability of these methods.","Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for  Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for  Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for  Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Division Laboratory and Pharmacy, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for  Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; National Health Care Institute (ZIN), Diemen, The Netherlands.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for  Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

34270458,"The global demand for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently far  outweighs the available global supply and manufacturing capacity. As a result, securing doses of vaccines for low- and middle-income countries has been challenging, particularly for African countries. Clinical trial investigation for COVID-19 vaccines has been rare in Africa, with the only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for COVID-19 vaccines having been conducted in South Africa. In addition to addressing the current inequities in the vaccine roll-out for low- and middle-income countries, there is a need to monitor the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in these regions. Although RCTs are the superior method for evaluating vaccine efficacy, the feasibility of conducting RCTs to monitor COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness during mass vaccine campaigns will likely be low. There is still a need to evaluate the effectiveness of mass COVID-19 vaccine distribution in a practical manner. We discuss how target trial emulation, the application of trial design principles from RCTs to the analysis of observational data, can be used as a practical, cost-effective way to evaluate real-world effectiveness for COVID-19 vaccines. There are several study design considerations that need to be made in the analyses of observational data, such as uncontrolled confounders and selection biases. Target trial emulation accounts for these considerations to improve the analyses of observational data. The framework of target trial emulation provides a practical way to monitor the effectiveness of mass vaccine campaigns for COVID-19 using observational data.","1Rwanda Biomedical Centre, Kigali, Rwanda.; 2Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,  Canada.; 1Rwanda Biomedical Centre, Kigali, Rwanda.; 3The International COVID-19 Data Alliance, Health Data Research UK, London,  United Kingdom.; 4Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton,  Ontario, Canada.; 2Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,  Canada.; 5Department of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of  British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",tpmd210482 [pii]; 10.4269/ajtmh.21-0482 [doi],Nsanzimana S; Gupta A; Uwizihiwe JP; Haggstrom J; Dron L; Arora P; Park JJH,,,,,,,2021/07/16 17:26,20211005,20210716,2021 Jul 16,2021/07/17 06:00,,,"Nsanzimana, Sabin; Gupta, Alind; Uwizihiwe, Jean Paul; Haggstrom, Jonas; Dron, Louis; Arora, Paul; Park, Jay J H",,,3,,1476-1645,0002-9637,0002-9637,0370507,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,eng,tpmd210482 [pii]; 10.4269/ajtmh.21-0482 [doi],20211130,COVID-19/*prevention & control; COVID-19 Vaccines/*immunology; Developing Countries; Humans; SARS-CoV-2/*immunology,2021/10/06 06:00,,,,,,NLM,561-563,2021/06/16 00:00,2021/07/16 17:26,2021/10/06 06:00,,2021/07/16 00:00,2021/07/17 06:00,2021/04/29 00:00,United States,PMC8592367,2021/07/16,epublish,Journal Article,0 (COVID-19 Vaccines),IM,,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2021 Jul 16;105(3):561-563. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.21-0482.,MEDLINE,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The Need for a Practical Approach to Evaluate the Effectiveness of COVID-19  Vaccines for Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,,,,105
39934432,"BACKGROUND: Establishing a causation relationship between treatments and patient  outcomes is of essential importance for researchers to guide clinical decision-making with rigorous scientific evidence. Despite the fact that randomized controlled trials are widely regarded as the gold standard for identifying causal relationships, they are not without its generalizability and ethical constraints. Observational studies employing causal inference methods have emerged as a valuable alternative to exploring causal relationships. METHODS: In this tutorial, we provide a succinct yet insightful guide about identifying causal relationships using observational studies, with a specific emphasis on research in the field of neurosurgery. RESULTS: We first emphasize the importance of clearly defining causal questions and conceptualizing target trial emulation. The limitations of the classic causation framework proposed by Bradford Hill are then discussed. Following this, we introduce one of the modern frameworks of causal inference, which centers around the potential outcome framework and directed acyclic graphs. We present the obstacles presented by confounding and selection bias when attempting to establish causal relationships with observational data within this framework. CONCLUSION: To provide a comprehensive overview, we present a summary of efficient causal inference methods that can address these challenges, along with a simulation example to illustrate these techniques.","Center for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.; Center for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.; Center for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.; Center for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.; Duke-NUS Medical School, Programme in Health Services and Systems Research,  Singapore, Singapore.; Department of Statistics and Data Science, National University of Singapore,  Singapore, Singapore.; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.; Center for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.; Duke-NUS Medical School, Programme in Health Services and Systems Research,  Singapore, Singapore.; Institute of Data Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore,  Singapore.; SingHealth AI Office, Singapore Health Services, Singapore, Singapore.; Department of Neurosurgery, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  v.volovici@erasmusmc.nl.; Center for Complex Microvascular Surgery, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The  Netherlands. v.volovici@erasmusmc.nl.",10.1007/s00701-025-06450-6 [pii]; 6450 [pii]; 10.1007/s00701-025-06450-6 [doi],Liu M; Wang X; Lee JW; Chakraborty B; Liu N; Volovici V,ORCID: 0000-0002-5798-5360,© 2025.

40506003,"BACKGROUND: In randomized trials, the intention-to-treat effect is the effect of  assignment to treatment strategies. The concept of assignment may not be clearly defined when using observational data to emulate a target trial. AIMS: We aimed to assess the practical implications of using data on prescription versus dispensation as analogues of treatment assignment in observational analyses. METHODS: We used the primary care-derived Swedish Primary Care Cardiovascular Database of individuals with newly diagnosed hypertension between 2006 and 2014 and linked registers. We compared the effect of two antihypertensive drug classes on the five-year risk of cancer and ischemic heart disease. Treatment assignment was first mapped using prescription data, and then dispensation data. With unique confounding structures, we sequentially adjusted for different classes of risk factor due to uncertainty over the choice of relevant confounders for prescription vs. dispensation. RESULTS: 7770 individuals were eligible when assignment was defined using prescription compared with 5964 when defined using dispensation. For both cancer and ischemic heart disease outcomes, both higher and lower relative risks of the outcome were consistent with our data. Effect estimates did not vary with the choice of prescription or dispensation data as analogues of assignment, nor with sequential adjustment for class of risk factor. CONCLUSION: The mapping of prescription or dispensation data to treatment assignment influences the size and characteristics of the study population and the structure of confounding. However, we found no clear numerical differences in effect estimates in this study. Further investigation is required in other settings.","Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.

40425936,"The ICH E9(R1) estimand framework provides a systematic approach to ensure  alignment among clinical trial objectives, trial conduct, statistical analyses, and interpretation of results, however, whether it can be readily utilized for the pharmacoepidemiologic safety studies has not been established. We selected articles on drug safety published in the Journal Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety (PDS), during 2020 to investigate whether estimand attributes were well defined in the study design and reporting. We found that among twenty-five articles selected, nineteen were cohort studies and six were nested case-control studies. All studies had well-defined exposure, outcome, target population, and population level summary. The term intercurrent event (ICE) was not mentioned in any of the studies; however, many cohort studies discussed drug discontinuation, treatment modification and terminal events, and strategies to handle them. All studies used methods to control for confounding: propensity score methods or covariate adjustment, or both for cohort studies; matching and covariate adjustment for the nested case-control studies. We conclude that while the estimand framework can serve to add clarity and precision to pharmacoepidemiologic safety studies, more detailed considerations are required for bias assessment to compensate for the lack of randomization and other shortcomings in observational studies. Recent pharmacoepidemiology frameworks, such as Target Trial Emulation, STaRT-RWE, HARPER could be combined with the complementary principals from the estimand framework to help achieve the study objectives.","Office of Biostatistics, Office of Translational Sciences, Center for Drug  Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Silver Spring, MD, 20993, USA. yong.ma@fda.hhs.gov.; GlaxoSmithKline Plc, London, UK.; Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research,  Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, USA.; Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.; Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.; University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Office of Biostatistics, Office of Translational Sciences, Center for Drug  Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Silver Spring, MD, 20993, USA.",10.1007/s43441-025-00780-4 [pii]; 10.1007/s43441-025-00780-4 [doi],Ma Y; Haddad J; Liu W; Snyder E; Bennett D; Mayo S,,© 2025.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of initiating benzodiazepine or z-hypnotic treatment in early, mid, and late pregnancy on fifth-grade numeracy and literacy scholastic skills in children by emulating 3 target trials. The trials are identical except for the timing of enrollment and the number of eligible individuals. Eligibility to the trials required a history of anxiety and/or depression prior to pregnancy. We used data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study, linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, to emulate the trials. We adjusted for baseline covariates that were available at time 0 for each trial by inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. The findings of this study did not show any effect of mothers' initiation of treatment with benzodiazepines or z-hypnotics in early, mid, or late pregnancy on the children's fifth-grade test scores in numeracy and literacy. The study results provide reassurance for patients in need of benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics during pregnancy; however, these findings need to be interpreted with caution due to low study power in some of the analyses.

34737647,"PURPOSE: Investigating intended or unintended effects of sustained drug use is of  high clinical relevance but remains methodologically challenging. This feasibility study aims to evaluate the usefulness of the parametric g-formula within a target trial for application to an extensive healthcare database in order to address various sources of time-related biases and time-dependent confounding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), we estimated the pancreatic cancer incidence comparing two hypothetical treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), i.e., (A) sustained metformin monotherapy vs (B) combination therapy with DPP-4 inhibitors after one year metformin monotherapy. We included 77,330 persons with T2DM who started metformin therapy at baseline between 2005 and 2011. Key aspects for avoiding time-related biases and time-dependent confounding were the emulation of a target trial over a 7-year follow-up period and application of the parametric g-formula. RESULTS: Over the 7-year follow-up period, 652 out of the 77,330 study subjects had a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Assuming no unobserved confounding, we found evidence that the metformin/DPP-4i combination therapy increased the risk of pancreatic cancer compared to a sustained metformin monotherapy (risk ratio: 1.47; 95% bootstrap CI: 1.07-1.94). The risk ratio decreased in sensitivity analyses addressing protopathic bias. CONCLUSION: While protopathic bias could not fully be ruled out, and computational challenges necessitated compromises in the analysis, the g-formula and target trial emulation proved useful: Self-inflicted biases were avoided, observed time-varying confounding was adjusted for, and the estimated risks have a clear causal interpretation.","Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Department of  Biometry and Data Management, Bremen, Germany.; Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Department of  Biometry and Data Management, Bremen, Germany.; Institute for Biometrics and Epidemiology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center  for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Institute for Biometrics and Epidemiology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center  for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.; Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Department of  Biometry and Data Management, Bremen, Germany.; Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Department of  Biometry and Data Management, Bremen, Germany.; Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Department of  Biometry and Data Management, Bremen, Germany.",328342 [pii]; 10.2147/CLEP.S328342 [doi],Börnhorst C; Reinders T; Rathmann W; Bongaerts B; Haug U; Didelez V; Kollhorst B,ORCID: 0000-0001-9004-1540; ORCID: 0000-0003-2684-7413; ORCID: 0000-0001-7804-1740; ORCID: 0000-0003-4695-7185; ORCID: 0000-0002-1886-2923; ORCID: 0000-0001-8587-7706; ORCID: 0000-0001-5964-954X,© 2021 Börnhorst et al.,,,"Dr. Bianca Kollhorst, Tammo Reinders, Dr. Wolfgang Rathmann and Dr. Brenda  Bongaerts report grants from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), during the conduct of the study.

The objective of the study was to investigate long-term effects of salvage radiotherapy. METHODS: A prospective, controlled, non-randomized trial at 14 Swedish center's including 4,003 patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy 2008-2011. A target trial emulation approach was used to identify eligible patients that was treated with salvage radiotherapy. The control group received no salvage radiotherapy. Outcomes were assessed by patient questionnaires on ordinal scales and statistical group comparisons were made using ordered logit regression with adjustment for baseline outcome and confounding factors. The primary endpoints were bowel, urinary and sexual function and bothering due to dysfunction at 8 years. RESULTS: Eleven percent (330/3,139) of the analyzed study population received salvage radiotherapy. Fecal leakage, leakage of mucus and hematochezia were more common after receiving salvage radiotherapy compared with the control group; 4.5% versus 2.6% odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): (1.90 [1.38; 2.62]), 6.8% versus 1.5% 4.14 (2.98; 5.76) and 8.6% versus 1.2% 4.14 (2.98; 5.76), respectively. Urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and hematuria were more common after receiving salvage radiotherapy, 34% versus 23% 2.23 (2.65; 3.00), 65% versus 57% 1.65 (1.18; 2.29) and 16% versus 1.6% 11.17 (5.68; 21.99), respectively. CONCLUSION: Salvage radiotherapy was associated with increased risk for fecal leakage, hematochezia, urinary incontinence and hematuria. Our results emphasize the importance of selecting patients for salvage radiotherapy to avoid overtreatment and to give high quality pre-treatment information to ensure patients' preparedness for late side-effects.","Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,  Sweden; Department of Pelvic Cancer, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. stefan.carlsson@ki.se.; Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy,  University of Gothenburg, Scandinavian Surgical Outcomes Research Group, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,  Sweden; Department of Pelvic Cancer, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Division of Biostatistics, IMM, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy,  University of Gothenburg, Scandinavian Surgical Outcomes Research Group, Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Surgery, Region Västra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Östra, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Department of Urology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy,  University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Urology, Region Västra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Department of Urology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy,  University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Urology, Region Västra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Department of Urology, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden; Department of  Translational Medicine, Division of Urological Cancers, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.; Department of Oncology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg,  Gothenburg, Sweden.; Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,  Sweden; Department of Pelvic Cancer, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Urology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Health System, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy,  University of Gothenburg, Scandinavian Surgical Outcomes Research Group, Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Surgery, Region Västra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Östra, Gothenburg, Sweden.",10.2340/sju.v58.7318 [doi],Carlsson S; Bock D; Lantz A; Angenete E; Koss Modig K; Hugosson J; Bjartell A; Steineck G; Wiklund P; Haglind E,,,,,,,2023/05/12 03:58,20230515,20230511,2023 May 11,2023/05/12 07:06,,,"Carlsson, Stefan; Bock, David; Lantz, Anna; Angenete, Eva; Koss Modig, Katarina; Hugosson, Jonas; Bjartell, Anders; Steineck, Gunnar; Wiklund, Peter; Haglind, Eva",,,,,2168-1813,2168-1805,,101587186,Scandinavian journal of urology,eng,10.2340/sju.v58.7318 [doi],20230515,Male; Humans; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Hematuria/etiology; *Prostatic Neoplasms/radiotherapy/surgery; Prostatectomy/adverse effects/methods; *Urinary Incontinence/epidemiology/etiology; Salvage Therapy/adverse effects,2023/05/15 06:42,,,,,,NLM,11-19,2022/09/13 00:00,2023/05/12 03:58,2023/05/15 06:42,,,2023/05/12 07:06,2023/01/17 00:00,Sweden,,,epublish,Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article,,IM,,Scand J Urol. 2023 May 11;58:11-19. doi: 10.2340/sju.v58.7318.,MEDLINE,Scand J Urol,Salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: functional outcomes in the  LAPPRO trial after 8-year follow-up.,,,,58
35944152,"A valid study design is essential when assessing the safety of drugs based on  observational data. The comparator group is a key element of the design and can greatly influence the results. The active comparator new user design is a go-to design in observational drug safety research where a target trial of initiation of a study drug versus usual care is emulated. A comparison with another treatment that targets similar patients as the study drug and has no effect on the outcome has great potential to reduce bias. However, the active comparator new user design can be difficult to implement because no suitable comparator drug is available or because it requires extensive exclusion of study drug initiators. In this analysis, we evaluated alternative study designs that can be used in drug safety assessments when the active comparator new user design is not optimal. Using target trial emulation as a common framework, we defined and evaluated the following designs: traditional no use, no-use episodes, active comparator new user, prevalent new user, generalized prevalent new user, and hierarchical prevalent new user. We showed that all designs can be implemented by using sequential cohorts and simply altering the patient selection criteria, i.e., identifying increasingly restrictive cohorts. In this way, all designs are nested in each other and the differences between them can be demonstrated clearly. We concluded that many study-specific factors need to be considered when choosing a design, including indication, available comparator drugs, treatment patterns, potential effect modification, and sample size.","From the Clinical Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; From the Clinical Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.; From the Clinical Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska  Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.",00001648-202209000-00014 [pii]; 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001521 [doi],Wintzell V; Svanström H; Pasternak B,ORCID: 0000-0001-7759-0887; ORCID: 0000-0002-2097-8466,"Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

38707795,"INTRODUCTION: Even with effective vaccines, patients with CKD have a higher risk  of hospitalization and death subsequent to COVID-19 infection than those without CKD. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir have been approved for emergency use, but their effectiveness for the CKD population is still unknown. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing mortality and severe COVID-19 in the CKD population. METHODS: This was a target trial emulation study using electronic health databases in Hong Kong. Patients with CKD aged 18 years or older who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were included. The per-protocol average treatment effect among COVID-19 oral antiviral initiators, including all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and ventilatory support within 28 days, were compared to noninitiators. RESULTS: Antivirals have been found to lower the risk of all-cause mortality, with Molnupiravir at a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.95] and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir at an HR of 0.78 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.00]. However, they do not significantly reduce the risk of ICU admission (molnupiravir: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.30]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.56 to 1.32]) or ventilatory support (molnupiravir: HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.33]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.37]). There was a greater risk reduction in males and those with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The nirmatrelvir-ritonavir trial also showed reduced risk for those who had antiviral treatment and received 3 or more vaccine doses. CONCLUSION: Both molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced mortality rates for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CKD.","Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong  Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of  Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li  Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of  Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.",S2468-0249(24)00098-6 [pii]; 10.1016/j.ekir.2024.02.009 [doi],Cheng FWT; Yan VKC; Wan EYF; Chui CSL; Lai FTT; Wong CKH; Li X; Zhang IR; Tang SCW; Wong ICK; Chan EWY,,© 2024 International Society of Nephrology.

40531835,"Target trial emulation applies design principles from randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) to the analysis of observational data, potentially replicating RCT results in real-world settings. The EPIC trial reported that pimobendan delays the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF) and extends survival in dogs with preclinical degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD). The current study aimed to explore the extent to which target trial emulation approximates the EPIC trial results in a primary-care setting. Grade IV/VI murmur diagnosis was defined as the treatment intervention stage. There were 928 dogs ≥ 6 years and ≤ 15 kg at first grade IV/VI murmur diagnosis recorded from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018 in the VetCompass database included in the study. A causal inference ""target trial emulation"" approach using VetCompass anonymised clinical data was designed to replicate the EPIC trial with adaptation for a primary-care setting and to address immortal time bias, confounding bias and loss to follow-up. After bias adjustments to establish causal effects using observational data, the 5-year CHF cumulative incidence was lower in dogs prescribed pimobendan (34.1%, 95% CI 26.5-42.0) than dogs not prescribed pimobendan (56.3%, 95% CI 52.8-59.8). Dogs prescribed pimobendan had 311 fewer days of health lost to CHF (95% CI 224-395 days) within 5 years. Dogs prescribed pimobendan lived longer (adjusted mean survival time 1051 days, 95% CI 967-1125) than dogs not prescribed pimobendan (905 days, 95% CI 871-940 days). This study demonstrates that target trial emulation within veterinary research can replicate findings from RCTs. Clinically, the current findings suggest that preclinical grade IV murmur diagnosis may offer an appropriate intervention stage to begin pimobendan therapy in dogs with presumed DMVD.","Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield,  United Kingdom.; University College London, Department of Statistical Science, London, United  Kingdom.; Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield,  United Kingdom.; Comparative Biomedical Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Herts,  United Kingdom.; Clinical Science and Services, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, United  Kingdom.; Professional Services, The Royal Veterinary College, Royal College Street,  London, United Kingdom.; Department of Intensive Care, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield,  United Kingdom.; Straid Veterinary Clinic, Beaconsfield, United Kingdom.; Clinical Science and Services, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, United  Kingdom.; Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield,  United Kingdom.",PONE-D-25-01002 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pone.0325695 [doi],Pegram C; Diaz-Ordaz K; Brodbelt DC; Chang YM; Boswood A; Wilshaw J; Reep CAT; Balling S; Sahota J; Church DB; O'Neill DG,ORCID: 0000-0002-8367-5294; ORCID: 0000-0002-9408-7324,"Copyright: © 2025 Pegram et al.

34034959,"Deprescribing is defined as ""the planned and supervised process of dose reduction  or stopping of medication that might be causing harm, or no longer be of benefit"". Barriers to deprescribing include healthcare professional fear and lack of guidance. These may stem from limited available evidence on benefits and harms of deprescribing medications commonly used among older persons. Advances in pharmacoepidemiology and causal inference methods to evaluate comparative effectiveness and safety of prescribing medications have yet to be considered for deprescribing medication. This paper discusses select methods and how they can be applied to deprescribing research, using case studies of benzodiazepines and low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Target trial emulation involves the explicit application of design principles from randomised controlled trials to observational studies. Several design aspects, including defining eligibility criteria and time zero, require additional considerations for deprescribing studies. The active comparator new user design also presents challenges, including selection of an appropriate comparator. This paper discusses these aspects, and others, in relation to deprescribing studies. Furthermore, methods proposed to control for confounding, in particular, the prior event rate ratio and propensity scores, are discussed. Introduction of billing codes or mechanisms for accurately determining when deprescribing has occurred would enhance the ability to conduct research using routinely collected data. Although the approaches discussed in this paper may strengthen observational studies of deprescribing, their use may be best suited to certain scenarios or research questions, where randomised controlled trials may be less feasible.","School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Royal College of Surgeons in  Ireland (RCSI) University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland.

39989040,"Externally controlled trials have commonly been used when conducting a randomized  controlled trial (RCT) is not feasible or ethical. By allowing the study of new treatments, use of external controls can lead to accelerated advances in the management of rare diseases. The use of external controls, however, introduces new challenges due to potential differences between the population the external controls are enrolled from and the population the patients on the new trial are enrolled from. Some differences include, but are not limited to, differences in how patients are diagnosed and treated, differences in the case mix of the underlying populations, differences in the ability to measure outcomes, and differences in data collection. We discuss the potential benefits and challenges of externally controlled trials, as well as strategies to mitigate bias, including the estimand and target-trial emulation framework. We also provide a brief overview of statistical methodology commonly used in these settings. We note that although the strategies presented may help mitigate some of these challenges, they cannot replace an RCT framework, and investigators should be aware of the potential limitations of externally controlled trials.","Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA 91016, United States.; Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, University of Southern  California, Los Angeles, CA 90032, United States.; NRG Oncology Statistics and Data Management Center, American College of  Radiology, Philadelphia, PA 19103, United States.; Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA 91016, United States.; Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, University of Southern  California, Los Angeles, CA 90032, United States.; Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA 91016, United States.; Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, University of Southern  California, Los Angeles, CA 90032, United States.; NRG Oncology Statistics and Data Management Center, American College of  Radiology, Philadelphia, PA 19103, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02903, United  States.",8030355 [pii]; lgae046 [pii]; 10.1093/jncimonographs/lgae046 [doi],Nuño MM; Pugh SL; Ji L; Piao J; Dignam JJ; Steingrimsson JA,ORCID: 0000-0003-2031-929X,"© The Author(s) 2025.

38289601,"IMPORTANCE: Process-based quality measures are generally intended to promote  evidence-based practices that have been proven to improve outcomes. However, due to lack of standardized implementation of diagnostic codes in dentistry, assessing the association between process and oral health outcomes has been challenging. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of adhering to dental quality measures with patient oral health outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a target trial emulation, a causal inference framework, this retrospective cohort study estimated the difference in the risk of developing tooth decay between US children who adhered to process-based dental quality measures (receiving topical fluoride and sealant [treated groups]) and those who did not (control groups). Electronic health records of US children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020, were used. To emulate random treatment assignment based on baseline confounders, coarsened exact matching was used to produce covariate balance between the treated and control groups. A time-to-event regression model produced effect estimates, adjusting for time-varying covariates. Near-far matching was used to account for unmeasured confounders as a sensitivity analysis. Data were analyzed from May 1 to August 7, 2023. EXPOSURES: Adherence to dental quality measures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of tooth decay. RESULTS: Among 69 212 US children aged between 0 and 18 years (mean [SD] age, 10.2 [5.0] years; 49.5% male, 50.4% female, and 0.1% unknown or transgender), 1930 (2.8%) were Asian, 2038 (2.9%) were Black, 8667 (12.5%) were Hispanic, 33 632 (48.6%) were White, and 22 945 (33.2%) were multiracial, other, or missing racial and ethnic group identification. Relative to control individuals, treated individuals were more likely to be at elevated risk of caries (fluoride measure: 16 453 [76.5%] vs 15 236 [39.8%]; sealant measure: 2264 [54.6%] vs 997 [44.0%]) and have regular dental visits (fluoride measure: 21 498 [100%] vs 13 741 [35.9%]; sealant measure: 1623 [39.2%] vs 871 [38.4%]). Adherence to quality measures was associated with reduced risk of tooth decay with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78- 0.86) for fluoride and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76-0.97) for sealant in the matched cohort. Benefits of adhering to quality measures were greater among children at elevated vs low risk and with public vs commercial insurance for both measures. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort study, adhering to dental quality measures was associated with reduced risk of tooth decay, and benefits were greater among children at elevated risk and with public insurance. These findings provide insights in facilitating targeted application of quality measures or developing more tailored quality improvement initiatives.","Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology, Harvard School of Dental  Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard T.

37163130,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines have substantially mitigated the disproportional impact of  SARS-CoV-2 on the high morbidity and mortality experienced by nursing home residents. However, variation in vaccine efficacy, immune senescence and waning immunity all undermine vaccine effectiveness over time. The introduction of the bivalent vaccine in September 2022 aimed to counter this increasing susceptibility and consequences of breakthrough infection, however data on the durability and protection of the vaccine are limited. We evaluated the durability of immunity and protection after the first bivalent vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 in nursing home residents. METHODS: For the immunologic evaluation, community nursing home volunteers agreed to serial blood sampling before, at two weeks, three and six months after each vaccination for antibodies to spike protein and pseudovirus neutralization activity over time. Concurrent clinical outcomes were evaluated by reviewing electronic health record data from residents living in Veterans Administration managed nursing home units. Residents without recent infection but prior vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 were followed over time beginning with administration of the newly available bivalent vaccine using a target trial emulation (TTE) approach; TTE compared time to breakthrough infection, hospitalization and death between those who did and did not receive the bivalent vaccine. RESULTS: We evaluated antibodies in 650 nursing home residents; 452 had data available following a first monovalent booster, 257 following a second monovalent booster and 321 following a bivalent vaccine. We found a rise in BA.5 neutralization activity from the first and second monovalent boosters through the bivalent vaccination regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 history. Titers declined at three and six months after the bivalent vaccination but generally exceeded those at three months compared to either prior boost. BA.5 neutralization titers six months after the bivalent vaccination were diminished but had detectable levels in 80% of infection-naive and 100% of prior infected individuals. TTE evaluated 5903 unique subjects, of whom 2235 received the bivalent boost. TTE demonstrated 39% or greater reduction in risk of infection, hospitalization or death at four months following the bivalent boost. CONCLUSION: Immunologic results mirrored those of the TTE and suggest bivalent vaccination added substantial protection for up to six months after bivalent vaccination with notable exceptions. However, the level of protection declined over this period, and by six months may open a window of added vulnerability to infection before the next updated vaccine becomes available. We strongly agree with the CDC recommendation that those who have not received a bivalent vaccination receive that now and these results support a second bivalent booster for those at greatest risk which includes many nursing home residents.","Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI.; Department of Health Services, Policy & Practice, School of Public Health, Brown  University, Providence, Rhode Island.; Center of Innovation in Long-Term Services and Supports, Veterans Administration  (VA) Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island.; Center of Innovation in Long-Term Services and Supports, Veterans Administration  (VA) Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island.; Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH.; Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI.; Center of Innovation in Long-Term Services and Supports, Veterans Administration  (VA) Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI.; Rhode Island Department of Health, Providence, RI.; Center of Innovation in Long-Term Services and Supports, Veterans Administration  (VA) Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island.; Center of Innovation in Long-Term Services and Supports, Veterans Administration  (VA) Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island.; Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI.; Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH.; Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Louis Stokes Cleveland  Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI.; Department of Health Services, Policy & Practice, School of Public Health, Brown  University, Providence, Rhode Island.; Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Louis Stokes Cleveland  Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.",2023.04.25.23289050 [pii]; 10.1101/2023.04.25.23289050 [doi],Gravenstein S; DeVone F; Oyebanji OA; Abul Y; Cao Y; Chan PA; Halladay CW; McConeghy KW; Nugent C; Bosch J; King CL; Wilson BM; Balazs AB; White EM; Canaday DH,,,,,,,2023/05/10 11:23,,20230425,2023 Apr 25,2023/05/10 12:42,,,"Gravenstein, Stefan; DeVone, Frank; Oyebanji, Oladayo A; Abul, Yasin; Cao, Yi; Chan, Philip A; Halladay, Christopher W; McConeghy, Kevin W; Nugent, Clare; Bosch, Jürgen; King, Christopher L; Wilson, Brigid M; Balazs, Alejandro B; White, Elizabeth M; Canaday, David H",,I01 BX005507/BX/BLRD VA/United States; R01 AI129709/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; U01 CA260539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,,,,,,101767986,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,eng,2023.04.25.23289050 [pii]; 10.1101/2023.04.25.23289050 [doi],20240712,,2023/05/10 12:43,,,,,,NLM,,,2023/05/10 11:23,2023/05/10 12:43,,2023/05/09 00:00,2023/05/10 12:42,,United States,PMC10168517,2023/05/09,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,medRxiv [Preprint]. 2023 Apr 25:2023.04.25.23289050. doi:  10.1101/2023.04.25.23289050.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,medRxiv,Durability of immunity and clinical protection in nursing home residents  following bivalent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.,,EBioMedicine. 2024 Jul;105:105180. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2024.105180.

38218669,"BACKGROUND: JYNNEOS(TM) vaccine has been used as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)  during a mpox outbreak in New York City (NYC). Data on effectiveness are limited. METHODS: Effectiveness of a single dose of JYNNEOS(TM) vaccine administered subcutaneously ≤ 14 days as PEP for preventing mpox disease was assessed among individuals exposed to case-patients from May 22, 2022-August 24, 2022. Individuals were evaluated for mpox through 21 days post-exposure. An observational study was conducted emulating a sequence of nested ""target"" randomized trials starting each day after exposure. Results were adjusted for exposure risk and race/ethnicity. Analyses were conducted separately based on last (PEP(L)) and first (PEP(F)) exposure date. We evaluated the potential to overestimate PEP effectiveness when using conventional analytic methods due to exposed individuals developing illness before they can obtain PEP (immortal time bias) compared to the target trial. RESULTS: Median time from last exposure to symptom onset (incubation period) among cases that did not receive PEP(L) was 7 days (range 1-16). Time to PEP(L) receipt was 7 days (range 0-14). Among 549 individuals, adjusted PEP(L) and PEP(F) effectiveness was 19 % (95 % Confidence Interval [CI], -54 % to 57 %) and -7% (95 % CI, -144 % to 53 %) using the target trial emulation, respectively, and 78 % (95 % CI, 50 % to 91 %) and 73 % (95 % CI, 31 % to 91 %) using conventional analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Determining PEP effectiveness using real-world data during an outbreak is challenging. Time to PEP in NYC coupled with the observed incubation period resulted in overestimated PEP effectiveness using a conventional method. The target trial emulation, while yielding wide confidence intervals due to small sample size, avoided immortal time bias. While results from these evaluations cannot be used as reliable estimates of PEP effectiveness, we present important methodologic considerations for future evaluations.","Division of Disease Control, New York City Department of Health and Mental  Hygiene, New York City, NY, USA.

39296549,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between food needs and diabetes outcomes.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Longitudinal cohort study, using a target trial emulation approach. 96,792 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent food need assessment in a network of community-based health centers were followed up to 36 months after initial assessment. We used targeted minimum loss estimation to estimate the association between not experiencing food needs, compared with experiencing food needs, and hemoglobin a1c (HbA1c), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and LDL cholesterol. The study period was June 24th, 2016 to April 30th, 2023. RESULTS: We estimated that not experiencing food needs, compared with experiencing food needs, would be associated with 0.12 percentage points lower (95% Confidence Interval [CI] -0.16% to -0.09%, p = < 0.0001) mean HbA1c at 12 months. We further estimated that not experiencing food needs would be associated with a 12-month SBP that was 0.67 mm Hg lower (95%CI -0.97 to -0.38 mm Hg, p < .0001), DBP 0.21 mm Hg lower (95%CI -0.38 to -0.04 mm Hg, p = .01). There was no association with lower LDL cholesterol. Results were similar at other timepoints, with associations for HbA1c, SBP, and DBP of similar magnitude, and no difference in LDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: We estimated that not experiencing food needs may be associated with modestly better diabetes outcomes. These findings support testing interventions that address food needs as part of their mechanism of action.","Division of General Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine,  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Cecil G.

39798018,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to compare the 5 year overall  survival of patients with stage I-III colon cancer treated by laparoscopic colectomy versus open colectomy. METHODS: Using Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Cancer Registry data from 2008 to 2018, we will emulate a phase III, multicenter, open-label, two-parallel-arm hypothetical target trial in adult patients with stage I-III colon cancer who received laparoscopic or open colectomy as an elective treatment. An inverse-probability weighted Royston‒Parmar parametric survival model (RPpsm) will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of laparoscopic versus open surgery after confounding factors are balanced between the two treatment arms. Further to the hazard ratio, we will also compute differences in the absolute risk (at 1, 3, and 5 years) and restricted mean survival time (up to 1, 3, and 5 years). A weighted Kaplan‒Meier curve will be used to compare five-year overall survival in both treatment arms. Various comparator and sensitivity analyses will be performed to check the robustness of the results that will be estimated by the RPpsm main model. Treatment period- and stage-specific results will also be provided. DISCUSSION: This study aims to causally model the effect of laparoscopic versus open colectomy on 5 year overall survival using a target trial emulation approach. As the cancer registry data do not cover BMI, comorbidity, and previous abdominal surgery for non-malignant indications, the potential for residual confounding arising from these factors is a limitation of this study. This will be approached in a quantitative bias analysis using the E-method. The results will substantiate existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open colectomy in patients with stage I-III colon cancer and may guide clinical decisions as to whether a laparoscopic approach is as safe as an open approach in terms of improving 5-year overall survival in these patient groups.","Institute for Community Medicine, Section Epidemiology of Health Care and  Community Health, University Medicine Greifswald, 17489, Greifswald, Germany. semaw.abera@uni-greifswald.de.; Institute for Community Medicine, Section Epidemiology of Health Care and  Community Health, University Medicine Greifswald, 17489, Greifswald, Germany.; Cancer Registry Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.; Institute for Community Medicine, Section Epidemiology of Health Care and  Community Health, University Medicine Greifswald, 17489, Greifswald, Germany.; Institute for Community Medicine, Section Epidemiology of Health Care and  Community Health, University Medicine Greifswald, 17489, Greifswald, Germany.; Institute for Community Medicine, Section Epidemiology of Health Care and  Community Health, University Medicine Greifswald, 17489, Greifswald, Germany.; Cancer Registry Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.; Institute for Community Medicine, Section Epidemiology of Health Care and  Community Health, University Medicine Greifswald, 17489, Greifswald, Germany.; Cancer Registry Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.",10.1007/s00432-024-06057-x [pii]; 6057 [pii]; 10.1007/s00432-024-06057-x [doi],Abera SF; Robers G; Kästner A; Stentzel U; Weitmann K; Hoffmann W,,© 2025.

36203944,"In Japan, specific health checkups were implemented to prevent metabolic syndrome  (MetS) and cardiovascular diseases in April 2008. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between lifestyle factors and the MetS incidence to understand how the disease can be prevented and to improve the public health policy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the specific health checkup data of 2,781 workers. Lifestyle factors were assessed using lifestyle-related items in the general health questionnaire included in the specific health checkups. The hazard ratio values for the incidence of MetS according to lifestyle-related items were determined from the data of the specific health checkup for 12 years. The Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to evaluate hazard ratio values after adjusting for confounding factors. The limitations of this research method are discussed using a target trial emulation framework which investigates problems such as biases in observational studies. The crude incidence rates per 1,000 person-years of MetS in women and men were 15.25 and 47.58, respectively. Three dietary lifestyle-related factors, namely ""Eating snacks and sweet beverages other than breakfast, lunch, and dinner,"" ""Eating faster than others,"" and ""Skipping breakfast at least three times a week,"" were identified, with the hazard ratio values 1.262 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.032-1.542, p = 0.023), 1.220 (95 % CI 1.032-1.442, p = 0.020) and 1.189 (95 % CI 1.012-1.397, p = 0.036), respectively. These results suggest that lifestyle improvements related to extracted lifestyle-related items contribute to the prevention of MetS.","Department of Health Screening, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital,  1712-3, Umusa, Nago City, Okinawa 905-8611, Japan.; Department of Health Screening, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital,  1712-3, Umusa, Nago City, Okinawa 905-8611, Japan.; Department of Health Screening, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital,  1712-3, Umusa, Nago City, Okinawa 905-8611, Japan.; Department of Health Screening, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital,  1712-3, Umusa, Nago City, Okinawa 905-8611, Japan.; Department of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Dialysis, Okinawa North Medical  Association Hospital, 1712-3, Umusa, Nago City, Okinawa 905-8611, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital,  1712-3, Umusa, Nago City, Okinawa 905-8611, Japan.",S2211-3355(22)00302-3 [pii]; 101995 [pii]; 10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101995 [doi],Kishimoto T; Churiki M; Miyazato T; Yamashiro A; Nagasawa Y; Shokita H,,© 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.,,,The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or  personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,2022/10/07 02:43,,20220919,2022 Dec,2022/10/08 06:00,,,"Kishimoto, Takuji; Churiki, Miwa; Miyazato, Tatsuya; Yamashiro, Akihiro; Nagasawa, Yoshitaka; Shokita, Hayashi",,,,,2211-3355,2211-3355,2211-3355,101643766,Preventive medicine reports,eng,10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101995 [doi]; 101995,20221009,,2022/10/08 06:01,,,,Cohort study; Lifestyle; Metabolic syndrome; Target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,101995,2022/09/17 00:00,2022/10/07 02:43,2022/10/08 06:01,2022/09/01 00:00 [revised],2022/09/19 00:00,2022/10/08 06:00,2022/05/15 00:00,United States,PMC9529971,2022/09/19,epublish,Journal Article,,,,Prev Med Rep. 2022 Sep 19;30:101995. doi: 10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101995.  eCollection 2022 Dec.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,Prev Med Rep,"Association between lifestyle and metabolic syndrome incidence of workers in  northern Okinawa, Japan: A cohort study.",,,,30
36205998,"IMPORTANCE: Kidney transplant is considered beneficial in terms of survival  compared with continued dialysis for patients with kidney failure. However, randomized clinical trials are infeasible, and available evidence from cohort studies is at high risk of bias. OBJECTIVE: To compare restricted mean survival times (RMSTs) between patients who underwent transplant and patients continuing dialysis across transplant candidate ages and depending on waiting time, applying target trial emulation methods. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients aged 18 years or older appearing on the wait list for their first single-organ deceased donor kidney transplant between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2018, in Austria were evaluated. Available data were obtained from the Austrian Dialysis and Transplant Registry and Eurotransplant and included repeated updates on wait-listing status and relevant covariates. Data were analyzed between August 1, 2019, and December 23, 2021. EXPOSURES: A target trial was emulated in which patients were randomized to either receive the transplant immediately (treatment group) or to continue dialysis and never receive a transplant (control group) at each time an organ became available. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from transplant allocation to death. Effect sizes in terms of RMSTs were obtained using a sequential Cox approach. RESULTS: Among the 4445 included patients (2974 men [66.9%]; mean [SD] age, 52.2 [13.2] years), transplant was associated with increased survival time across all considered ages compared with continuing dialysis and remaining on the wait list within a 10-year follow-up. The estimated RMST differences were 0.57 years (95% CI, -0.14 to 1.84 years) at age 20 years, 3.01 years (95% CI, 2.50 to 3.54 years) at age 60 years, and 2.48 years (95% CI, 1.88 to 3.04 years) at age 70 years. The survival benefit for patients who underwent transplant across ages was independent of waiting time. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that kidney transplant prolongs the survival time of persons with kidney failure across all candidate ages and waiting times.","Center for Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, Medical University of  Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Section for  Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Section for  Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Section for  Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical  University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Section for  Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Section for  Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical  University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Section for  Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Ordensklinikum Linz, Elisabethinen Hospital, Department of Medicine III,  Nephrology, Hypertension, Transplantation, Rheumatology, Geriatrics, Linz, Austria.",2797181 [pii]; zoi220993 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.34971 [doi],Strohmaier S; Wallisch C; Kammer M; Geroldinger A; Heinze G; Oberbauer R; Haller MC,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: No disclosures were reported.,,2022/10/07 11:33,20221011,20221003,2022 Oct 3,2022/10/08 06:00,,,"Strohmaier, Susanne; Wallisch, Christine; Kammer, Michael; Geroldinger, Angelika; Heinze, Georg; Oberbauer, Rainer; Haller, Maria C",,,10,,2574-3805,2574-3805,,101729235,JAMA network open,eng,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.34971 [doi]; e2234971,20221030,"Adult; Aged; Humans; *Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery; *Kidney Transplantation/methods; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Dialysis; *Renal Insufficiency; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2022/10/12 06:00,,,,,,NLM,e2234971,,2022/10/07 11:33,2022/10/12 06:00,,2022/10/07 00:00,2022/10/08 06:00,,United States,PMC9547326,2022/10/07,epublish,"Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,IM,,JAMA Netw Open. 2022 Oct 3;5(10):e2234971. doi:  10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.34971.,MEDLINE,JAMA Netw Open,Survival Benefit of First Single-Organ Deceased Donor Kidney Transplantation  Compared With Long-term Dialysis Across Ages in Transplant-Eligible Patients With Kidney Failure.,,,,5
40577013,"IMPORTANCE: Surgeon training with a specific implant is often not considered in  implant registry-based studies, which may lead to unobserved confounding bias. Discrepancies between registry and clinical trial outcomes for patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) may originate from differences in surgeon training levels. OBJECTIVE: To compare revision rates for knees operated on by knee surgeons specifically trained for PFA and knee surgeons who were not. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this population-based cohort study, the framework of a target trial was used to compare outcomes for 2 patient groups: patients who underwent PFA performed by knee surgeons who had (trial surgeons) vs who had not (nontrial surgeons) received focused PFA training as part of a randomized clinical trial. All primary PFA procedures from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2015, were identified using Danish registries and individual hospital notes with 6 years' follow-up. Data were analyzed from January 24 to March 1, 2024. EXPOSURE: Focused PFA training. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-year risk of revision. Analyses were conducted according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan, using multiple logistic regression to estimate marginal risk ratios for 6-year risks of revision, reoperation, and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Of 482 eligible knees of patients who had undergone PFA, 274 (57%; 206 female [75%]; mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years) were operated on by trial surgeons, and 208 (43%; 142 female [68%]; mean [SD] age, 57 [12] years) by nontrial surgeons. Trial surgeons operated on knees with higher patellofemoral Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis grade (range 0-4, with 0 indicating no osteoarthritis and 4 indicating severe osteoarthritis) than nontrial surgeons (79% vs 53% with grade 3 to 4) and higher tibiofemoral Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis grades (37% vs 17% with grade 2 to 4). The 6-year revision rate for trial surgeons was 8% (22 of 274 knees) vs 26% (54 of 208 knees) for nontrial surgeons, corresponding to an adjusted relative risk (RR) of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.22-0.56; P < .001). The reoperation rate was 12% (33 of 274 knees) for trial surgeons vs 19% (40 of 208 knees) for nontrial surgeons, with an adjusted RR of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.42-1.18; P = .19). There was no difference in mortality for trial vs nontribal surgeon groups (18 of 274 knees [7%] vs 12 of 208 knees [6%]; adjusted RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.53-2.33; P = .79). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study using a target trial emulation approach to assess the association of surgeon training with PFA outcomes, the cumulative 6-year revision rate for PFA was lower for knees operated on by PFA-trained knee surgeons, suggesting that such surgeon training was associated with a better outcome. This suggests that the level of training may be an important confounder for registry-based comparisons of implant outcome, and that this confounder may even obscure inherent implant outcomes.","Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University  Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University Hospital of Southern Denmark,  Esbjerg, Denmark.; Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen,  Copenhagen, Denmark.; Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen,  Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Copenhagen University Hospital,  Herlev-Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Now with Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hvidovre University Hospital,  Hvidovre, Denmark.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Copenhagen University Hospital,  Herlev-Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Now with Department of Surgery, Center for Surgical Science, Zealand University  Hospital, Køge, Denmark.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Vejle Hospital, Vejle, Denmark.; Department of Radiology, Herlev Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Section for Biostatistics and Evidence-Based Research, The Parker Institute,  Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Research Unit of Rheumatology, Department of Clinical Research, University of  Southern Denmark, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University  Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",2835703 [pii]; zoi250563 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.17825 [doi],Rasmussen LE; Hoffmann AG; Blanche P; Espersen F; Justesen TF; Rasmussen LE; Hangaard S; Christensen R; Odgaard A,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Lasse E.

40377984,"KEY POINTS: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use has not been  extensively studied in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In veterans with ADPKD, kidney function declined at a greater rate during the first 3 months post-SGLT2i initiation but subsequently attenuated. In veterans with ADPKD, SGLT2i versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor use was associated with slower long-term kidney function decline. BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are a pillar of kidney disease therapy, but their efficacy remains unknown in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We evaluated effects of SGLT2i on kidney function in ADPKD. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study within the Veterans Health Administration included adults with an ADPKD diagnosis code who initiated SGLT2i between January 2017 and May 2023. Repeated measures models were used to evaluate eGFR slope before and after SGLT2i initiation. Among patients with ADPKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus, a target trial emulation was used to compare the effects of SGLT2i versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) on eGFR slope. RESULTS: Among 348 eligible patients with ADPKD who started an SGLT2i, 93% were male, mean±SD age was 68±11, and median eGFR was 53 (interquartile range: 16–127) ml/min per 1.73 m(2). In adjusted analyses, the preinitiation eGFR slope was −0.79 (95% confidence interval, −1.26 to −0.33) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per 90 days. The eGFR slope steepened to −2.78 (−4.04 to −1.53) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) during the first 3 months postinitiation and then stabilized to −0.07 (−0.72 to 0.58) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) during months 3–12 postinitiation. The target trial emulation compared 217 SGLT2i users with 198 DPP4i users. In adjusted analyses, eGFR declined −4.03 (−6.45 to −1.60) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per 90 days faster in SGLT2i users versus DPP4i users during the first 3 months postinitiation; however, during the subsequent 3–12 months, the slope was more stable in SGLT2i initiators than DPP4i initiators, with a difference of 1.29 (0.16 to 2.41) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: In older patients with mild ADPKD and a high prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease who initiated an SGLT2i, there was an initial 3-month decline in eGFR followed by stabilization during the remainder of the year-long follow-up. Compared with DPP4i use, SGLT2i use was associated with a slower eGFR decline between 3 and 12 months postinitiation in patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings suggest that SGLT2is are potentially beneficial in older individuals with ADPKD in whom comorbid disease may play a greater role in kidney function decline, but further studies are required.","Kidney Health Research Collaborative, University of California, San Francisco,  San Francisco, California.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco, San Francisco, California.; Kidney Health Research Collaborative, University of California, San Francisco,  San Francisco, California.; San Francisco VA Health Care System, San Francisco, California.; Kidney Health Research Collaborative, University of California, San Francisco,  San Francisco, California.; San Francisco VA Health Care System, San Francisco, California.; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health,  Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.; Atlanta VA Health Care System, Decatur, Georgia.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama,  Birmingham, Alabama.; Birmingham VA Health Care System, Birmingham, Alabama.; Kidney Health Research Collaborative, University of California, San Francisco,  San Francisco, California.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco, San Francisco, California.; San Francisco VA Health Care System, San Francisco, California.; Kidney Health Research Collaborative, University of California, San Francisco,  San Francisco, California.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco, San Francisco, California.",01277230-990000000-00617 [pii]; CJASN-2024-001789 [pii]; 10.2215/CJN.0000000725 [doi],Eswarappa M; Madden E; Shlipak MG; Cui X; Mrug M; Estrella MM; Park M,ORCID: 0000-0002-4839-4809; ORCID: 0000-0001-6222-8623; ORCID: 0000-0002-9559-204; ORCID: 0000-0003-0621-9313; ORCID: 0000-0002-8902-9576; ORCID: 0000-0002-2695-0894,,doi: 10.2215/CJN.0000000757,,"Disclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online  version of the article at http://links.lww.com/CJN/C281.",,2025/05/16 12:03,,20250516,2025 May 16,2025/05/16 18:30,,,"Eswarappa, Meghana; Madden, Erin; Shlipak, Michael G; Cui, Xiangqin; Mrug, Michal; Estrella, Michelle M; Park, Meyeon",,Ben J.

40132841,"INTRODUCTION: Target trial emulation is a framework for evaluating the effects of  treatments using observational data. The trial emulation approach involves specifying key elements of a protocol for a target trial (a randomised controlled trial designed to address the question of interest) and then describing how best to emulate the trial using observational data. Recent years have seen an uptake of target trial emulation in several disease areas, although there are limited examples in cystic fibrosis (CF). This protocol describes a study which aims to assess the applicability of target trial emulation in CF. We aim to emulate an existing trial in CF and assess to what extent the results from the trial can be replicated using registry data. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The target trial is a published randomised controlled trial which found evidence for beneficial effects of azithromycin use on lung function in young adults with CF. Two emulated trials are planned: one using data from the UK CF Registry and one using data from the US CF Registry. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment and outcome definitions, follow-up period, and estimand of interest are all designed to match the published trial as closely as possible. The analysis step of the trial emulations will use causal inference methods to control for confounding. Results obtained in the emulated trials using registry data will be compared with those from the target trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee (Ref: 29609). This study has also been approved by the UK CF Registry Research Committee and the North Star Review Board. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant scientific conferences.","Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,  London, UK emily.granger@lshtm.ac.uk.; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Cystic Fibrosis Trust, London, UK.; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, UCL GOS  Institute of Child Health, London, UK.; Liverpool Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Liverpool, Liverpool,  UK.; University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital  Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.; Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Justus-Liebig-Universitat, Giessen, Germany.; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Community Health and Epidemiology, Dalhousie University, Halifax,  Nova Scotia, Canada.; Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital  Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.; Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,  London, UK.",bmjopen-2024-091357 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjopen-2024-091357 [doi],Granger E; Todd J; Charman SC; Cromwell E; Davies G; Frost F; Gifford A; Huang B; Hamblett NM; Naehrlich L; Ostrenga J; Stanojevic S; Szczesniak R; Keogh R,ORCID: 0000-0003-0134-1467; ORCID: 0000-0002-1887-9311; ORCID: 0000-0001-7931-8051,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

36609317,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a critical complication in elderly patients  with atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Recent preclinical studies suggested that non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) can potentially suppress the progression of cardiac fibrosis and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Whether different oral anticoagulants influence the risk of HF in older adults with AF and DM is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of HF in elderly patients with AF and DM who were administered NOACs or warfarin. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted based on claims data from the entire Taiwanese population. Target trial emulation design was applied to strengthen causal inference using observational data. Patients aged ≥ 65 years with AF and DM on NOAC or warfarin treatment between 2012 and 2019 were included and followed up until 2020. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed HF. Propensity score-based fine stratification weightings were used to balance patient characteristics between NOAC and warfarin groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The study included a total of 24,835 individuals (19,710 NOAC and 5,125 warfarin users). Patients taking NOACs had a significantly lower risk of HF than those taking warfarin (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses for individual NOACs suggested that dabigatran (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.93, p < 0.001), rivaroxaban (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86, p < 0.001), apixaban (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.90, p < 0.001), and edoxaban (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.86, p < 0.001) were associated with lower risks of HF than warfarin. The findings were consistent regardless of age and sex subgroups and were more prominent in those with high medication possession ratios. Several sensitivity analyses further supported the robustness of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide cohort study demonstrated that elderly patients with AF and DM taking NOACs had a lower risk of incident HF than those taking warfarin. Our findings suggested that NOACs may be the preferred oral anticoagulant treatment when considering the prevention of heart failure in this vulnerable population. Future research is warranted to elucidate causation and investigate the underlying mechanisms.","Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital,  Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.; School of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.; Center for Aging and Health, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical  Foundation, No. 707, Sec. 3, Chung Yang Rd., Hualien, 97002, Taiwan.; Institute of Medical Sciences, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.; Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health,  National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Dentistry, National Taiwan University Hospital and School of  Dentistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.; Department of Family Medicine, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical  Foundation, No. 707, Sec. 3, Chung Yang Rd., Hualien, 97002, Taiwan.; School of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.; Center for Aging and Health, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical  Foundation, No. 707, Sec. 3, Chung Yang Rd., Hualien, 97002, Taiwan.; Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition, University of Maryland School  of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Nutrition & Weight Management, Boston  University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; School of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan. drhkhuang@gmail.com.; Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health,  National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. drhkhuang@gmail.com.; Department of Family Medicine, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical  Foundation, No. 707, Sec. 3, Chung Yang Rd., Hualien, 97002, Taiwan. drhkhuang@gmail.com.; School of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan. twdoc1960@gmail.com.; Center for Aging and Health, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical  Foundation, No. 707, Sec. 3, Chung Yang Rd., Hualien, 97002, Taiwan. twdoc1960@gmail.com.",10.1186/s12933-022-01688-1 [pii]; 1688 [pii]; 10.1186/s12933-022-01688-1 [doi],Lin SM; Liu PP; Tu YK; Lai EC; Yeh JI; Hsu JY; Munir KM; Peng CC; Huang HK; Loh CH,,© 2023.

40287211,"Evidence-based medicine is central to reproductive health care, guiding  interventions such as ovarian stimulation protocols and fertility preservation strategies. While randomized controlled trials (RCT) remain the gold standard for providing evidence and for establishing causality, their limitations, including restricted generalizability and high costs, highlight the need for complementary methodologies. Real-world evidence (RWE), derived from real-world data (RWD) such as electronic health records and assisted reproductive technology (ART) registries, has the potential to bridge the gap between controlled research settings and routine clinical practice, particularly for evaluating long-term and rare outcomes. However, RWE faces considerable challenges, including bias, variability in data quality, and difficulties in establishing causality. This paper explores the role of RWE in ART. Despite its promise, RWE cannot replace RCT, particularly in scenarios where the signal-to-noise ratio is low, such as detecting small effect differences in ovarian stimulation protocols or treatment add-ons. Instead, in most instances, RWE is positioned to complement RCT, supported by emerging regulatory frameworks such as the guidelines of the European Medicine Agency and the European Union's tissue directives, which emphasize the generation of RWE from ART practice to strengthen patient follow-up and safety monitoring. For ART stakeholders, a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of RWE is essential, as is the target trial emulation framework on RWD, for advancing the field and improving patient outcomes.","Department of Gynaecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, University  Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany..

40667760,"HLA evolutionary divergence (HED), a continuous metric quantifying the  differences between each amino acid of two homologous HLA alleles, reflects the importance of the immunopeptidome presented to T lymphocytes. It has been associated with rejection after liver transplantation. This retrospective cohort study aimed to analyse the potential effect of donor or recipient HED on liver transplant rejection in a new series of patients transplanted during childhood and followed in adulthood. The study included 120 children who had been transplanted between 1991 and 2010 and were followed by routine biopsies and histological evaluations with a median of 14.1 years post-LT. Liver biopsies were performed routinely 1, 5, 10 and 20 years after transplantation and in the event of liver dysfunction. HED was calculated using the physicochemical Grantham distance for donor and recipient Class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and Class II (HLA-DRB1, -DQB1) alleles. The influence of HED on rejection was analysed using inverse probability weighting (IPW) and target trial emulation using the g method. Based on the IPW score, donor HED class I was correlated with the occurrence of late (> 90 days) rejection (HR, 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01-1.40) independently of HLA mismatches, donor age and initial induction. The emulated target trial confirmed that donor HED Class I has a causal effect on liver graft rejection and this relationship was observed long-term.","Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Fédération Des Spécialités  Digestives, Lyon, France.; Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France.; Etablissement Français du Sang, Décines, France.; Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Femme-Mère-Enfants, Service  d'Hépato-Gastroentérologie et Nutrition, Bron, France.; Etablissement Français du Sang, Décines, France.; Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Femme-Mère-Enfants, Service  d'Hépato-Gastroentérologie et Nutrition, Bron, France.; Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Fédération Des Spécialités  Digestives, Lyon, France.; Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France.; AP-HP, Hôpital Paul Brousse, Centre Hépato-Biliaire, INSERM, Unité 1193,  Hepatinov, and Université Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.; Hôpital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Université de  Paris, Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Histocompatibilité, Paris, France.; Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France.; Hospices Civils de Lyon, Groupe Hospitalier Est, Service d'Anatomie Pathologique,  Bron, France.; Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France.; Hospices Civils de Lyon, Groupe Hospitalier Est, Service d'Anatomie Pathologique,  Bron, France.; Etablissement Français du Sang, Décines, France.; AP-HP, Hôpital Paul Brousse, Centre Hépato-Biliaire, INSERM, Unité 1193,  Hepatinov, and Université Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.",10.1111/tan.70320 [doi],Dumortier J; Hamada S; Wischlen E; Mandier C; Laverdure N; Boillot O; Kounis I; Allain V; Hervieu V; Collardeau-Frachon S; Dubois V; Feray C,ORCID: 0000-0002-7824-5396; ORCID: 0000-0002-9091-8856; ORCID: 0000-0002-5819-6312; ORCID: 0000-0002-9557-8838,© 2025 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

36176312,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies determining the effect of red blood cell (RBC)  donor sex on recipient mortality have been inconsistent. Emulating hypothetical randomized target trials using large real-world data and targeted learning may clarify potential adverse effects. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a RBC transfusion database from the Capital Region of Denmark comprising more than 900,000 transfusion events defined the observational data. Eligible patients were minimum 18 years, had received a leukocyte-reduced RBC transfusion, and had no history of RBC transfusions within the past year at baseline. The doubly robust targeted maximum likelihood estimation method coupled with ensembled machine learning was used to emulate sex-stratified target trials determining the comparative effectiveness of exclusively transfusing RBC units from either male or female donors. The outcome was all-cause mortality within 28 days of the baseline-transfusion. Estimates were adjusted for the total number of transfusions received on each day k, hospital of transfusion, calendar period, patient age and sex, ABO/RhD blood group of the patient, Charlson comorbidity score, the total number of transfusions received prior to day k, and the number of RBC units received on each day k from donors younger than 40 years of age. FINDINGS: Among 98,167 adult patients who were transfused between Jan. 1, 2008, and Apr. 10, 2018, a total of 90,917 patients (54.6% female) were eligible. For male patients, the 28-day survival was 2.06 percentage points (pp) (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.81-2.32, P<0.0001) higher under treatment with RBC units exclusively from male donors compared with exclusively from female donors. In female patients, exclusively transfusing RBC units from either male or female donors increased the 28-day survival with 0.64pp (0.52-0.76, P<0.0001), and 0.62pp (0.49-0.75, P<0.0001) compared with the current practice, respectively. No evidence of a sex-specific donor effect was found for female patients (0.02pp [-0.18-0.22]). The sensitivity analyses showed that a large unknown causal bias would have to be present to affect the conclusions. INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that a sex-matched transfusion policy may benefit patients. However, a causal interpretation of the findings relies on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, treatment consistency, positivity, and minimal model misspecifications.

35970705,"OBJECTIVES: The Observational Patient Evidence for Regulatory Approval Science  and Understanding Disease (OPERAND) project examines whether real-world data (RWD) can be used to inform regulatory decision making. METHODS: OPERAND evaluates whether observational analyses using RWD to emulate index trials can produce effect estimates similar to those of the trials and examines the impact of relaxing the eligibility criteria of the observational analyses to obtain samples that more closely match the real-world populations receiving the treatments. In OPERAND, 2 research teams independently attempt to emulate the ROCKET Atrial Fibrillation and LEAD-2 trials using OptumLabs data. This article describes the design of the project, summarizes the approaches of the 2 research teams, and presents feasibility results for 2 emulations using new-user designs. RESULTS: There were differences in the teams' conceptualizations of the emulation, design decisions for cohort identification, and resulting RWD cohorts. These differences occurred even though both teams were guided by the same index trials and had access to the same source of RWD. CONCLUSIONS: Reasonable alternative design and analysis approaches may be taken to answer the same research question, even when attempting to emulate the same index trial. Researcher decision making is an understudied and potentially important source of variability across RWD analyses.","OptumLabs, Eden Prairie, MN, USA; Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.

37918640,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a network meta-analytic model for the evaluation  of treatment effectiveness within predictive biomarker subgroups, by combining evidence from individual participant data (IPD) from digital sources (in the absence of randomized controlled trials) and aggregate data (AD). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A Bayesian framework was developed for modeling time-to-event data to evaluate predictive biomarkers. IPD were sourced from electronic health records, using a target trial emulation approach, or digitized Kaplan-Meier curves. The model is illustrated using two examples: breast cancer with a hormone receptor biomarker, and metastatic colorectal cancer with the Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) biomarker. RESULTS: The model allowed for the estimation of treatment effects in two subgroups of patients defined by their biomarker status. Effectiveness of taxanes did not differ in hormone receptor positive and negative breast cancer patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors were more effective than chemotherapy in KRAS wild type colorectal cancer patients but not in patients with KRAS mutant status. Use of IPD reduced uncertainty of the subgroup-specific treatment effect estimates by up to 49%. CONCLUSION: Utilization of IPD allowed for more detailed evaluation of predictive biomarkers and cancer therapies and improved precision of the estimates compared to use of AD alone.","Department of Population Health Sciences, Biostatistics Research Group,  University of Leicester, Leicester, UK; Centre for Review and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.

39574419,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics of comparative non-randomised studies  that assess the effectiveness or safety, or both, of drug treatments. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. DATA SOURCES: Medline (Ovid), for reports published from 1 June 2022 to 31 August 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Reports of comparative non-randomised studies that assessed the effectiveness or safety, or both, of drug treatments were included. A randomly ordered sample was screened until 200 eligible reports were found. Data on general characteristics, reporting characteristics, and time point alignment were extracted, and possible related biases, with a piloted form inspired by reporting guidelines and the target trial emulation framework. RESULTS: Of 462 reports of non-randomised studies identified, 262 studies were excluded (32% had no comparator and 25% did not account for confounding factors). To assess time point alignment and possible related biases, three study time points were considered: eligibility, treatment assignment, and start of follow-up. Of the 200 included reports, 70% had one possible bias, related to: inclusion of prevalent users in 24%, post-treatment eligibility criteria in 32%, immortal time periods in 42%, and classification of treatment in 23%. Reporting was incomplete, and only 2% reported all six of the key elements considered: eligibility criteria (87%), description of treatment (46%), deviations in treatment (27%), causal contrast (11%), primary outcomes (90%), and confounding factors (88%). Most studies used routinely collected data (67%), but only 7% reported using validation studies of the codes or algorithms applied to select the population. Only 7% of reports mentioned registration on a trial registry and 3% had an available protocol. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study suggest that although access to real world evidence could be valuable, the robustness and transparency of non-randomised studies need to be improved.","Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre  for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Paris, France.; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu Centre d'Épidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France.; Cochrane Centre France, Paris, France.; Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre  for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Paris, France.; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu Centre d'Épidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France.; Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre  for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Paris, France.; Gastroentérologie et Oncologie Digestive, Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France.; Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre  for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Paris, France.; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu Centre d'Épidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France.; Cochrane Centre France, Paris, France.; Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre  for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Paris, France.; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu Centre d'Épidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France.; Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre  for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Paris, France.; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu Centre d'Épidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France.; Cochrane Centre France, Paris, France.; Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre  for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Paris, France.; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu Centre d'Épidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France.; Cochrane Centre France, Paris, France.",bmjmed-2024-000932 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjmed-2024-000932 [doi],Yaacoub S; Porcher R; Pellat A; Bonnet H; Tran VT; Ravaud P; Boutron I,ORCID: 0000-0003-0819-1561; ORCID: 0000-0003-1863-6739,Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

40659399,"INTRODUCTION: Randomised controlled trials have aimed to assess the effectiveness  of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with curative intent versus surgical resection for individuals diagnosed with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but have failed to recruit sufficient numbers of patients. Non-randomised studies for early-stage NSCLC have reported mixed outcomes following curative SABR versus surgical resection, but did not fully address confounding by indication. The Surgery Or RadioTherapy for early-stage cancer study (SORT) will assess the comparative effectiveness of SABR with curative intent versus surgical resection for NSCLC with a target trial emulation approach, as this can reduce biases in observational studies that aim to estimate the causal effect of interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The SORT study will use the National Cancer Registry for individuals diagnosed with early-stage NSCLC in England during 2015-2020 (inclusive) who received SABR with curative intent or surgical resection. These data will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, National Radiotherapy Data Set and the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy dataset to obtain information on clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and the treatment received. This target trial emulation will define study population eligibility criteria and regimens for SABR with curative intent and surgical resection. We will reduce the risk of residual confounding with instrumental variable analyses that will exploit geographical variation across the National Health Service in England in the use of SABR with curative intent versus surgical resection for early-stage NSCLC. The primary outcome will be 3-year all-cause mortality after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes will include 3-month, 6-month, 12-month and 24-month all-cause and lung-cancer mortality, time to death, numbers of hospitalisations, incremental costs and incremental cost-effectiveness. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee (reference number 29 717-1). Results will be disseminated to clinicians, patients, policy-makers and researchers.","Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and  Tropical Medicine Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and  Tropical Medicine Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London, UK.; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and  Tropical Medicine Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London, UK.; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK.; Clinical Oncology Department, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.; Division of Cancer Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and  Tropical Medicine Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London, UK richard.grieve@lshtm.ac.uk.",bmjopen-2025-103038 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjopen-2025-103038 [doi],Kagenaar E; Lugo-Palacios DG; Hutchings A; Aggarwal A; O'Neill S; Rachet B; Edwards J; Faivre-Finn C; Grieve R,ORCID: 0000-0001-5837-7773; ORCID: 0000-0001-8899-1301,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

39327529,"Methods have been developed for transporting evidence from randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) to target populations. However, these approaches allow only for differences in characteristics observed in the RCT and real-world data (overt heterogeneity). These approaches do not recognise heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) according to unmeasured characteristics (essential heterogeneity). We use a target trial design and apply a local instrumental variable (LIV) approach to electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, and examine both forms of heterogeneity in assessing the comparative effectiveness of two second-line treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We first estimate individualised estimates of HTE across the entire target population defined by applying eligibility criteria from national guidelines (n = 13,240) within an overall target trial framework. We define a subpopulation who meet a published RCT's eligibility criteria ('RCT-eligible', n = 6497), and a subpopulation who do not ('RCT-ineligible', n = 6743). We compare average treatment effects for pre-specified subgroups within the RCT-eligible subpopulation, the RCT-ineligible subpopulation, and within the overall target population. We find differences across these subpopulations in the magnitude of subgroup-level treatment effects, but that the direction of estimated effects is stable. Our results highlight that LIV methods can provide useful evidence about treatment effect heterogeneity including for those subpopulations excluded from RCTs.","Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; The Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy & Economics (CHOICE) Institute,  University of Washington School of Pharmacy, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Diabetes Trials Unit, The Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and  Metabolism, University of Oxford, OCDEM Building Churchill Hospital, Headington, UK.; Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.",HEC4903 [pii]; 10.1002/hec.4903 [doi],Lugo-Palacios DG; Bidulka P; O'Neill S; Carroll O; Basu A; Adler A; DíazOrdaz K; Briggs A; Grieve R,ORCID: 0000-0003-2621-5627; ORCID: 0000-0003-4238-7402; ORCID: 0000-0002-0777-1997; ORCID: 0000-0001-8899-1301,© 2024 The Author(s).

39240697,"Objective: While collaborative care is known to improve depressive and anxiety  symptoms in primary care, comparative effectiveness studies of virtual collaborative care versus virtual specialty psychiatry treatment in real world settings are lacking. This study examined patient depressive and anxiety symptoms over 6 months in collaborative care versus specialty psychiatry. Methods: This was an observational study with target trial emulation in a large, community-based, integrated health care system. Participants were ≥18 years old with mild-moderate depressive or anxiety symptoms measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale. Exclusion criteria included acute suicide risk. Patients were assigned to collaborative care or specialty psychiatry, and symptoms were measured 6 months after treatment initiation using linear mixed-effects regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results: There were N = 10,380 patients (n = 1,607 in collaborative care; n = 8,773 in specialty psychiatry) with depressive disorders and N = 2,935 (n = 570 in collaborative care; n = 2,365 in specialty psychiatry) with anxiety disorders. Model effects at 6 months showed significant symptom improvement for patients in collaborative care (adjusted mean difference [AMD] = -9.0, 95% CI, -9.7, -8.4 for depression; -5.4, 95% CI, -6.2, -4.7 for anxiety) and in specialty psychiatry (AMD = -5.0, 95% CI, -5.6, -4.5 for depression; -2.8, 95% CI, -3.6, -2.1 for anxiety), with patients in collaborative care showing significantly greater improvement compared to those in specialty psychiatry (AMD = -4.0, 95% CI, -4.7, -3.3, P < .0001 for depression; AMD = -2.6, 95% CI, -3.4, -1.8, P < .0001 for anxiety). Conclusions: Virtual collaborative care was at least as effective as specialty psychiatry for depression and anxiety. Collaborative care implementation can support national guidelines regarding depression and anxiety screening and treatment.","The Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland,  California.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California.; Corresponding Author: Kathryn K.

38008444,"BACKGROUND: As at June 14, 2023, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic  had affected more than 767 million people and caused more than 6.9 million deaths worldwide. This study aimed to clarify the lifestyle factors that influence the exacerbation of COVID-19 severity. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of patients with COVID-19 whose severity classification of ""moderate or severe"" (COVID-19 exacerbation) was defined as an objective variable. The 1,353 participants were selected from 4,899 patients with COVID-19 between August 10, 2020 and December 10, 2022. Participants who underwent a specific health checkup before the date for a COVID-19 consultation were included. Using binominal logistic regression analysis, we evaluated the odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 exacerbation according to lifestyle-related factors. Limitations were discussed using a target trial emulation framework which clarifies problems in observational studies. RESULTS: The explanatory variables extracted as factors that exacerbated COVID-19 severity were gender (OR [man vs. woman]: 2.533, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.484-4.322); age (OR [50s vs. 10s, 20s, or 30s]: 4.858, 95% CI 2.319-10.177; OR [60s]: 9.738, 95% CI 4.355-21.777; OR [70s + 80s + 90s]: 8.327, 95% CI 3.224-21.507); and comorbid chronic lung disease (OR ['yes' vs. 'no']: 2.892, 95% CI 1.227-6.818). The explanatory variables extracted as factors that reduce the severity of COVID-19 were hospital consultation year (OR [2022, predominantly Omicron variant prevalent vs. 2020, predominantly Alpha variant prevalent]: 0.180, 95% CI 0.058-0.559); number of vaccinations (OR [2 doses vs. 0 or one doses]: 0.223, 95% CI 0.114-0.436; OR [≥3 doses vs. 0 or one doses]: 0.090, 95% CI 0.035-0.229); regular exercise (exercising ≥2 days/week ≥30 minutes each at an intensity that causes a slight sweat for ≥1 year) (OR ['yes' vs. 'no']: 0.458, 95% CI 0.242-0.866). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the importance of vaccination, regular exercise, and prevention of chronic lung disease as measures against exacerbation of COVID-19 severity.","Department of Health Screening, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital.; Department of Respiratory and Infectious Diseases, Okinawa North Medical  Association Hospital.; Department of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Dialysis, Okinawa North Medical  Association Hospital.; Department of Respiratory and Infectious Diseases, Okinawa North Medical  Association Hospital.; Department of Respiratory and Infectious Diseases, Okinawa North Medical  Association Hospital.; Department of Respiratory and Infectious Diseases, Okinawa North Medical  Association Hospital.; Department of Health Screening, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital.; Department of Health Screening, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital.; Department of Gastroenterology, Okinawa North Medical Association Hospital.",23-00281 [pii]; 10.1265/ehpm.23-00281 [doi],Kishimoto T; Tasato D; Nagasawa Y; Higure Y; Setoguti M; Tibana R; Yamashiro A; Miyazato T; Shokita H,ORCID: 0000-0002-3645-4683,,,,The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,,2023/11/26 20:43,20231128,,2023,2023/11/27 00:43,,,"Kishimoto, Takuji; Tasato, Daisuke; Nagasawa, Yoshitaka; Higure, Yuri; Setoguti, Michika; Tibana, Rin; Yamashiro, Akihiro; Miyazato, Tatsuya; Shokita, Hayashi",,,,,1347-4715,1342-078X,1342-078X,9609642,Environmental health and preventive medicine,eng,10.1265/ehpm.23-00281 [doi]; 73,20231201,Male; Female; Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Japan/epidemiology; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control; SARS-CoV-2; Exercise; Vaccination,2023/11/28 06:42,,,,COVID-19; Chronic lung disease; Cross-sectional study; Lifestyle; Regular exercise; Severity; Target trial emulation; Vaccine,NOTNLM,NLM,73,,2023/11/26 20:43,2023/11/28 06:42,,2023/11/25 00:00,2023/11/27 00:43,,Japan,PMC10685076,2023/11/25,ppublish,Journal Article,SARS-CoV-2 variants,IM,,Environ Health Prev Med. 2023;28:73. doi: 10.1265/ehpm.23-00281.,MEDLINE,Environ Health Prev Med,"Vaccination, regular exercise, and prevention of chronic lung disease reduce  exacerbation of COVID-19 severity in northern Okinawa, Japan: A cross-sectional study.",,,,28

39052357,"This study aimed to compare patient outcomes between prescribing psychologists,  psychiatrists, and primary care physicians (PCPs). Private insurance claims (2005-2021; n = 307,478) were used to conduct an active comparator, new user longitudinal cohort study developed using target trial emulation. Inverse propensity for treatment weighting was used to adjust for baseline differences in a range of sociodemographic, clinical, and contextual patient factors. Differences in the 1-year rate of health care visits for adverse drug events (ADEs), psychiatric emergency department (ED) utilization, medication adherence, and psychotropic polypharmacy were identified between prescribing psychologists and the other provider types using doubly robust Cox proportional hazards models. Compared to patients of psychiatrists, patients of prescribing psychologists had a 24% lower rate of ADEs (95% CI [0.60, 0.96]), a 20% lower rate of psychotropic polypharmacy (95% CI [0.74, 0.86]), and similar rates of psychiatric ED utilization and medication nonadherence. Compared to patients of PCPs, patients of prescribing psychologists had 138% higher rates of psychiatric ED utilization (95% CI [1.67, 3.39]), 175% higher rates of psychotropic polypharmacy (95% CI [2.53, 2.99]), 28% lower rates of medication nonadherence (95% CI [0.66, 0.78]), and similar rates of ADEs. Using robust pharmacoepidemiological methods, we noted that among mental health specialists, prescribing psychologists appear to be as safe and efficacious as psychiatrists in a large sample of privately insured patients. Notable differences in safety and efficacy when compared to PCPs may be attributable to differences between specialty and primary care. Future research on prescribing psychologists should move toward studies of care quality.

34648516,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between statin treatment and Coronavirus Disease  2019 (COVID-19) mortality has been discussed due to the pleiotropic effects of statins on coagulation and immune mechanisms. However, available observational studies are hampered by study design flaws, resulting in substantial heterogeneity and ambiguities. Here, we aim to determine the relationship between statin treatment and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This cohort study included all Stockholm residents aged 45 or older (N = 963,876), followed up from 1 March 2020 until 11 November 2020. The exposure was statin treatment initiated before the COVID-19-pandemic, defined as recorded statin dispensation in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register between 1 March 2019 and 29 February 2020. COVID-19-specific mortality was ascertained from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using multivariable Cox regression models. We further performed a target trial emulation restricted to initiators of statins. In the cohort (51.6% female), 169,642 individuals (17.6%) were statin users. Statin users were older (71.0 versus 58.0 years), more likely to be male (53.3% versus 46.7%), more often diagnosed with comorbidities (for example, ischemic heart disease 23.3% versus 1.6%), more frequently on anticoagulant and antihypertensive treatments, less likely to have a university-level education (34.5% versus 45.4%), and more likely to have a low disposable income (20.6% versus 25.2%), but less likely to reside in crowded housing (6.1% versus 10.3%). A total of 2,545 individuals died from COVID-19 during follow-up, including 765 (0.5%) of the statin users and 1,780 (0.2%) of the nonusers. Statin treatment was associated with a lowered COVID-19 mortality (adjusted HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.97, P = 0.01), and this association did not vary appreciably across age groups, sexes, or COVID-19 risk groups. The confounder adjusted HR for statin treatment initiators was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.59 to 1.05, P = 0.10) in the emulated target trial. Limitations of this study include the observational design, reliance on dispensation data, and the inability to study specific drug regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment had a modest negative association with COVID-19 mortality. While this finding needs confirmation from randomized clinical trials, it supports the continued use of statin treatment for medical prevention according to current recommendations also during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Centre for Epidemiology and Community Medicine, Region Stockholm, Stockholm,  Sweden.; Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Region Stockholm,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; The George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney,  Australia.; Department of Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care, Karolinska University  Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,  Sweden.; Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Centre for Epidemiology and Community Medicine, Region Stockholm, Stockholm,  Sweden.",PMEDICINE-D-21-02232 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003820 [doi],Bergqvist R; Ahlqvist VH; Lundberg M; Hergens MP; Sundström J; Bell M; Magnusson C,ORCID: 0000-0003-1383-3194; ORCID: 0000-0001-5397-3541; ORCID: 0000-0003-2247-8454; ORCID: 0000-0001-7464-0324,,,,"I have read the journal’s policy and the authors of this manuscript have the  following competing interests: JS has stock ownership in companies providing services to Itrim, Amgen, Janssen, Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Boehringer, Bayer, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, outside the submitted work.",,2021/10/14 17:19,20211022,20211014,2021 Oct,2021/10/15 06:00,,,"Bergqvist, Rita; Ahlqvist, Viktor H; Lundberg, Michael; Hergens, Maria-Pia; Sundström, Johan; Bell, Max; Magnusson, Cecilia",,,10,,1549-1676,1549-1277,1549-1277,101231360,PLoS medicine,eng,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003820 [doi]; e1003820,20230921,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19/*mortality/prevention & control; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Sweden/epidemiology",2023/02/25 06:00,,,,,,NLM,e1003820,2021/09/20 00:00,2021/10/14 17:19,2023/02/25 06:00,,2021/10/14 00:00,2021/10/15 06:00,2021/05/20 00:00,United States,PMC8516243,2021/10/14,epublish,Journal Article; Observational Study,0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors),IM,,PLoS Med. 2021 Oct 14;18(10):e1003820. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003820.  eCollection 2021 Oct.,MEDLINE,PLoS Med,"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and COVID-19 mortality in Stockholm, Sweden: A  registry-based cohort study.",,,,18

Employing a target trial emulation approach, we compared the effectiveness of different interdose intervals among >6 million mRNA vaccine recipients in Georgia, USA, from December 2020 to March 2022. We compared three protocols defined by interdose interval: recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (17-25 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; 24-32 days for Moderna), late-but-allowable (26-42 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; 33-49 days for Moderna), and late ( ≥ 43 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; ≥50 days for Moderna). In the short-term, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lowest under the FDA-recommended protocol. Longer-term, the late-but-allowable protocol resulted in the lowest risk (risk ratio on Day 120 after the first dose administration compared to the FDA-recommended protocol: 0.83 [95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.84]).

37976062,"IMPORTANCE: Birth at 39 weeks' gestation is common and thought to be safe for  mother and neonate. However, findings of long-term outcomes for children born at this gestational age have been conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of birth at 39 weeks' gestation with childhood numeracy and literacy scores at ages 7 to 9 years compared with birth at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this Australian statewide, population-based cohort study using a causal inference framework based on target trial emulation, perinatal data on births between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2011, were linked to educational outcomes at 7 to 9 years of age. Statistical analyses were performed from December 2022 to June 2023. EXPOSURE: Birth at 39 weeks' gestation compared with birth at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Numeracy and literacy outcomes were assessed at 7 to 9 years of age using Australian National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy data and defined by overall z score across 5 domains (grammar and punctuation, reading, writing, spelling, and numeracy). Multiple imputation and doubly robust inverse probability weighted regression adjustment were used to estimate population average causal effects. RESULTS: The study population included 155 575 children. Of these children, 49 456 (31.8%; 24 952 boys [50.5%]) were born at 39 weeks' gestation and were compared with 106 119 (68.2%; 52 083 boys [49.1%]) born at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation. Birth at 39 weeks' gestation was not associated with altered educational outcomes for children aged 7 to 9 years compared with their peers born at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation (mean [SE] z score, 0.0008 [0.0019] vs -0.0031 [0.0038]; adjusted risk difference, -0.004 [95% CI, -0.015 to 0.007]). Each educational domain was investigated, and no significant difference was found in grammar and punctuation (risk difference [RD], -0.006 [95% CI, -0.016 to 0.005]), numeracy (RD, -0.009 [95% CI, -0.020 to 0.001]), spelling (RD, 0.001 [95% CI, -0.011 to 0.0013]), reading (RD, -0.008 [95% CI, -0.019 to 0.003]), or writing (RD, 0.006 [95% CI, -0.005 to 0.016]) scores for children born at 39 weeks' gestation compared with those born at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation. Birth at 39 weeks' gestation also did not increase the risk of scoring below national minimum standards in any of the 5 tested domains.

39673191,"Activists, policymakers, and scholars increasingly have advocated for reparations  payments to Black Americans to redress the harms of enslavement and discriminatory practices that followed. This study examined the effects of a hypothetical monetary reparations intervention on all-cause premature and overall mortality among Black adults in the U.S. We used the Black-white wealth gap to calculate monetary costs, modeling the effects of wealth influxes of $905,426.10 (in 2019 USD) to each Black household (the amount necessary to eliminate the mean Black-white wealth gap), distributed over 10 years. We applied a target trial emulation framework to data in the Panel Study on Income Dynamics (n=16,010). Each Black household head or spouse/partner was followed from baseline until death, incomplete follow-up, 18 years after baseline, or the end of follow-up in 2019, whichever occurred first. Using the g-formula to account for time-fixed and time-varying confounders, we found a 29% reduction in premature mortality and a 25.6% reduction in overall mortality among Black adults under the reparations intervention. Our findings provide evidence that reparations are a lifesaving and justice-promoting social policy that could significantly contribute to efforts to eliminate health inequities.","Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Dornsife School of Public Health,  Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Dornsife School of Public Health,  Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.; The Ubuntu Center on Racism, Global Movements, and Population Health Equity,  Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

40295442,"INTRODUCTION: Exclusion criteria are designed to optimize the scientific yield  and safety of clinical trials. However, periodic analysis is necessary to understand the impact on trial complexity, enrollment, generalizability, and costs. We analyzed the types of exclusion criteria used among clinical trials performed in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients and impact upon exclusion of patients. METHODS: We identified trials involving SAH patients that provided a list of exclusion criteria and determined the number and proportion of those trials which used various exclusion criteria, proportion of excluded patients for each of the exclusion criteria and whether Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) was used. We also used target trial emulation approach and applied arbitrary trial exclusion criteria to a single center cohort of SAH patients to determine proportions of patients excluded for each of the reasons for exclusion. RESULTS: A total of 109 trials involving SAH patients were identified, of which 68(62.3%) provided a list of the exclusion criteria. The median number of exclusion criteria was 6 (range 2-9). The most common exclusion criteria were pregnancy (n = 31 trials), SAH due to other causes (trauma, fusiform or mycotic aneurysm, n = 26 trials) and significant liver disease/hepatic insufficiency (n = 19 trials). CONSORT was used in 16(23.5%) trials and 18 (16.5%) trials provided the proportion of patients excluded according to each of the exclusion criteria. In a single center cohort, the highest proportion of patients were excluded because no aneurysm was identified on imaging (23%) followed by withdrawal of care (9.6%) and need for dual anti-platelet treatment (8.6%). The in-hospital mortality was higher in patients who were excluded as compared with those who were included in the hypothetical trial (22 [30.1%] of 73 and 0 [0%] of 31 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis on exclusion criteria used and proportion of patients excluded in clinical trials involving SAH patients will assist in future trial enrollment, completion, and generalizability. Standardized reporting using CONSORT in clinical trials involving SAH patients is strongly recommended.","Zeenat Qureshi Stroke Institute, Columbia, MO, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.; Zeenat Qureshi Stroke Institute, Columbia, MO, USA.

40663057,"Immortal time bias due to post-treatment definition of eligibility criteria can  affect experimental and observational studies, and yet, in contrast to the extensive literature on the classical form of immortal time bias, it has seldom been the focus of methodological discussions. Here, we propose an account of eligibility-related immortal time bias that uses the principal stratification framework to explain the non-comparability of treatment arms (or exposure groups) conditional on selection. In particular, we show that the statistical estimand that conditions on observed eligibility after time zero of follow-up can be interpreted using partially overlapping principal strata. Further, we show that, under this perspective, as the timing of eligibility approaches time zero of follow-up, the probabilities of the outcome for eligible individuals monotonically approach the corresponding unconditional (in absence of selection) expected potential outcomes under different treatment levels. Our study provides a potential outcomes-based explanation of eligibility-related immortal time bias, and indicates that, in addition to the target trial emulation framework, principal effects might, for some studies, be useful causal estimands.","Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, United  Kingdom.; Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.",8202879 [pii]; 10.1093/aje/kwaf146 [doi],Gonçalves BP; Suzuki E,,"© The Author(s) 2025.

38012126,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests an overestimation of the benefits associated  with arteriovenous (AV) fistula versus graft in certain populations. We assessed hazards of all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization and death associated with AV access type in patients who started hemodialysis with a catheter in France, overall and by subgroups of age, sex and comorbidities. METHODS: We performed a target trial emulation including patients who initiated hemodialysis with a catheter from 2010 through 2018 and were followed by the REIN Registry. We identified first-created fistula or graft through the French national health-administrative database. We used joint frailty models to deal with recurrent hospitalizations and potential informative censoring by death, and inverse probability weighting to account for confounding. RESULTS: From the 18 800 patients included (mean age 68 ± 15 years, 35% women), 5% underwent AV graft creation first. The weighted hazard ratio (wHR) of all-cause hospitalization associated with graft was 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.15], that of vascular access-related hospitalization was 1.43 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.55), and those of cardiovascular- and infection-related hospitalizations were 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.26) and 1.11 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.28), respectively. Results were consistent for most subgroups, except that the highest hazard of all-cause, cardiovascular- and infection-related hospitalizations with graft was blunted in patients with comorbidities (i.e. diabetes, wHR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10; 1.10, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.26; and 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients starting hemodialysis with a catheter, AV graft creation is associated with increased hazard of vascular access-related hospitalizations compared with fistula. This may not be the case for death or other causes of hospitalization.","Université de Bordeaux, INSERM, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center,  UMR1219, CIC1401-EC, Bordeaux, France.; Université de Bordeaux, INSERM, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center,  UMR1219, CIC1401-EC, Bordeaux, France.; Maison du Rein - AURAD  Aquitaine, Gradignan, France.; INSERM, Clinical Investigation Center-Clinical Epidemiology-CIC-1401, Bordeaux,  France.; Université de Bordeaux, INSERM, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center,  UMR1219, CIC1401-EC, Bordeaux, France.; INSERM, Clinical Investigation Center-Clinical Epidemiology-CIC-1401, Bordeaux,  France.; Department of Pediatric Nephrology, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.; Registre REIN, Agence de la biomédecine, Saint Denis La Plaine, France.; Cellule régionale REIN Limousin, Department of Nephrology, CHU Dupuytren 2,  Limoges, France.; INSERM, Clinical Investigation Center-Clinical Epidemiology-CIC-1401, Bordeaux,  France.; Department of Nephrology Transplantation Dialysis and Apheresis, CHU de Bordeaux,  Univ.

34809637,"BACKGROUND: To assess the completeness of reporting, research transparency  practices, and risk of selection and immortal bias in observational studies using routinely collected data for comparative effectiveness research. METHOD: We performed a meta-research study by searching PubMed for comparative effectiveness observational studies evaluating therapeutic interventions using routinely collected data published in high impact factor journals from 01/06/2018 to 30/06/2020. We assessed the reporting of the study design (i.e., eligibility, treatment assignment, and the start of follow-up). The risk of selection bias and immortal time bias was determined by assessing if the time of eligibility, the treatment assignment, and the start of follow-up were synchronized to mimic the randomization following the target trial emulation framework. RESULT: Seventy-seven articles were identified. Most studies evaluated pharmacological treatments (69%) with a median sample size of 24,000 individuals. In total, 20% of articles inadequately reported essential information of the study design. One-third of the articles (n = 25, 33%) raised some concerns because of unclear reporting (n = 6, 8%) or were at high risk of selection bias and/or immortal time bias (n = 19, 25%). Only five articles (25%) described a solution to mitigate these biases. Six articles (31%) discussed these biases in the limitations section. CONCLUSION: Reporting of essential information of study design in observational studies remained suboptimal. Selection bias and immortal time bias were common methodological issues that researchers and physicians should be aware of when interpreting the results of observational studies using routinely collected data.","Centre of Research Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Inserm, Université de  Paris, F-75004, Paris, France. nguyenthuvandkh@gmail.com.; Meta-Research Innovation Centre at Stanford (METRICS), Stanford University, 1265  Welch Rd, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. nguyenthuvandkh@gmail.com.; Centre of Research Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Inserm, Université de  Paris, F-75004, Paris, France.; Centre of Research Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Inserm, Université de  Paris, F-75004, Paris, France.; Cochrane France, AP-HP, 75004, Paris, France.; Centre of Research Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Inserm, Université de  Paris, F-75004, Paris, France.; Cochrane France, AP-HP, 75004, Paris, France.; Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, Assistance Publique des  Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP), F-75004, Paris, France.; Centre of Research Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Inserm, Université de  Paris, F-75004, Paris, France.; Cochrane France, AP-HP, 75004, Paris, France.; Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, Assistance Publique des  Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP), F-75004, Paris, France.; Centre of Research Epidemiology and Statistics (CRESS), Inserm, Université de  Paris, F-75004, Paris, France.; Cochrane France, AP-HP, 75004, Paris, France.; Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, Assistance Publique des  Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP), F-75004, Paris, France.",10.1186/s12916-021-02151-w [pii]; 2151 [pii]; 10.1186/s12916-021-02151-w [doi],Nguyen VT; Engleton M; Davison M; Ravaud P; Porcher R; Boutron I,ORCID: 0000-0003-2197-0455,© 2021.

39447995,"OBJECTIVES: A lower-quality colonoscopy has been shown to be less effective in  reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence than a higher-quality colonoscopy, but the comparison with no-screening colonoscopy (noSC) is lacking. We aimed to compare the 13-year risk of developing CRC between persons with I) a higher-quality screening colonoscopy (higherQualSC), II) a lower-quality screening colonoscopy (lowerQualSC), and III) without a screening colonoscopy. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A health-care database (∼20% of the German population) was used to emulate a target trial with three arms: higherQualSC vs lowerQualSC vs noSC at baseline. The quality of screening colonoscopy was categorized based on the polyp detection rate of the examining physician (cut-off: 21.8%). We included persons aged 55-69 years at average CRC risk and CRC screening naïve at baseline. We estimated adjusted cumulative CRC incidence over 13 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The higherQualSC arm comprised 142,960 persons, the lowerQualSC arm 62,338 persons, and the noSC arm 124,040 persons. The adjusted 13-year CRC risk was 1.77% in the higherQualSC arm, 2.09% in the lowerQualSC arm, and 2.74% in the noSC arm. Compared to the noSC arm, the adjusted relative risk was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.84) in the lowerQualSC arm and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60-0.69) in the higherQualSC arm. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a lowerQualSC is also effective in reducing CRC incidence compared to noSC. However, the effect is about one-third less than that of a higherQualSC.","Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research  and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.

40578930,"BACKGROUND: Research is needed to measure the effects of shared decision-making  (SDM) on discontinuation of opioid therapy for chronic pain. DESIGN: Target trial emulation. SETTING: National pain research registry from September 2016 to January 2024. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 328 patients currently using opioid therapy for chronic low back pain at baseline, including 164 patients each in greater and lesser SDM groups matched on propensity scores. MEASUREMENTS: SDM was measured with the Communication Behavior Questionnaire. Primary outcomes involving discontinuation of opioid therapy and opioid prescribing frequency and secondary outcomes of pain, function, and health-related quality of life were measured over 12 months. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of patients was 56.1 (SD, 11.1) years and 239 (72.9%) were female. During 1178 quarterly encounters, greater SDM was associated with less frequent discontinuation of opioid therapy 3 months postbaseline (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.86; P = .006) and more frequent opioid prescribing 3 to 12 months postbaseline (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.11-1.38: P < .001). Although greater SDM was associated with worse physical function, and opioid therapy was associated with greater back-related disability and worse physical function, these results were not clinically important. SDM x opioid therapy interaction effects were not observed, indicating that more frequent use of opioid therapy with SDM did not yield better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: SDM was associated with less frequent short-term discontinuation of opioid therapy and more frequent long-term opioid prescribing that was not associated with better outcomes. Thus, SDM is necessary but insufficient to improve opioid prescribing for patients with chronic pain.","From the University of North Texas Health Science Center, Forth Worth, TX (JCL,  MD); Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD (SA). john.licciardone@unthsc.edu.; From the University of North Texas Health Science Center, Forth Worth, TX (JCL,  MD); Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD (SA).; From the University of North Texas Health Science Center, Forth Worth, TX (JCL,  MD); Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD (SA).",38/2/275 [pii]; 10.3122/jabfm.2024.240290R1 [doi],Licciardone JC; Digilio M; Aryal S,,© Copyright 2025 by the American Board of Family Medicine.,,,Conflict of interest: None.,,2025/06/27 20:42,20250627,20250627,2025 Jun 27,2025/06/28 00:39,,,"Licciardone, John C; Digilio, Michaela; Aryal, Subhash",,,2,,1558-7118,1557-2625,,101256526,Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,eng,10.3122/jabfm.2024.240290R1 [doi],20250627,"Humans; Female; *Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use/administration & dosage; *Chronic Pain/drug therapy; Middle Aged; Male; *Decision Making, Shared; Quality of Life; *Low Back Pain/drug therapy; Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data; Adult; Aged; *Withholding Treatment/statistics & numerical data; Registries/statistics & numerical data",2025/06/28 00:40,,,,Analgesics; Chronic Pain; Communication; Low Back Pain; Opioid; Pain Management; Patient-Centered Care; Pharmacology; Physician's Practice Patterns; Propensity Score; Quality of Life; Shared Decision-Making; Surveys and Questionnaires; Target Trial Emulation Study,NOTNLM,NLM,275-289,2024/11/04 00:00,2025/06/27 20:42,2025/06/28 00:40,2024/10/19 00:00 [revised],,2025/06/28 00:39,2024/08/02 00:00,United States,,,epublish,Journal Article,"0 (Analgesics, Opioid)",IM,,J Am Board Fam Med. 2025 Jun 27;38(2):275-289. doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2024.240290R1.,MEDLINE,J Am Board Fam Med,Shared Decision-Making and Discontinuation of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain.,,,,38
40474431,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Veterans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have an elevated  risk for needing mental health emergency care (MHEC) relative to uninfected comparators, as measured by emergency department or urgent care clinic utilization for a mental health diagnosis. DATA SOURCES/EXTRACTION: Data from Veterans Health Administration (VHA), VHA-paid, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid-paid services were used to identify incident MHEC use within 1 year of infection for Veterans with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched comparators. STUDY DESIGN: This was a national, retrospective cohort study that leveraged a target trial emulation framework to examine long-term outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among Veterans enrolled in VHA care. Uninfected comparators were matched based on month of infection, demographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics. We calculated cumulative incidence rates per 10,000 persons and utilized Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for MHEC up to one year post-infection. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cohort included 207,968 Veterans with SARS-CoV-2 and 1,036,944 comparators. The 365-day incidence of MHEC use was greater among SARS-CoV-2 patients than comparators (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: [1.44, 1.52]). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 had a higher hazard for MHEC use than comparators in all timeframes analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased MHEC use. Active care coordination with existing mental health treatment providers may help mitigate post-infection mental health distress. Future research should explore specific contextual factors contributing to MHEC, such as gaps in continuity of care.","Center to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care, VA Portland Health Care System  (HCS), Portland, Oregon, USA.;

38828924,"PURPOSE: Introduction of new medications to health-system formularies is often  not accompanied by assessments of their clinical impact on the local patient population. The growing availability of electronic health record (EHR) data and advancements in pharmacoepidemiology methods offer institutions the opportunity to monitor the medication implementation process and assess clinical effectiveness in the local clinical context. In this study, we applied novel causal inference methods to evaluate the effects of a formulary policy introducing tocilizumab therapy for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We conducted a medication use evaluation utilizing EHR data from patients admitted to a large medical center during the 6 months before and after implementation of a formulary policy endorsing the use of tocilizumab for treatment of COVID-19. The impact of tocilizumab on 28-day all-cause mortality was assessed using a difference-in-differences analysis, with ineligible patients serving as a nonequivalent control group, and a matched analysis guided by a target trial emulation framework. Safety endpoints assessed included the incidence of secondary infections and liver enzyme elevations. Our findings were benchmarked against clinical trials, an observational study, and a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Following guideline modification, tocilizumab was administered to 69% of eligible patients. This implementation was associated with a 3.1% absolute risk reduction in 28-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.86; number needed to treat to prevent one death, 32) attributable to the inclusion of tocilizumab in the guidelines and an additional 8.6% absolute risk reduction (odds ratio, 0.65; number needed to treat to prevent one death, 12) linked to its administration. These findings were consistent with estimates from published literature, although the effect estimates from the difference-in-differences analysis exhibited imprecision. CONCLUSION: Evaluating formulary management decisions through novel causal inference approaches offers valuable estimates of clinical effectiveness and the potential to optimize the impact of new medications on population outcomes.","Center for Pharmacotherapy Research and Quality, Department of Pharmacy,  Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of  Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.; Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Montefiore Medical  Center, Bronx, NY, USA.; Division of Pharmacotherapy, Department of Pharmacy, Montefiore Medical Center,  Bronx, NY, USA.; Division of Pharmacotherapy, Department of Pharmacy, Montefiore Medical Center  (Wakefield), Bronx, NY, USA.; Department of Nursing, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.; Department of Pharmacy Services, Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC, USA.; Center for Pharmacotherapy Research and Quality, Department of Pharmacy,  Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.; Division of Pharmacotherapy, Department of Pharmacy, Montefiore Medical Center,  Bronx, NY, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of  Medicine, Bronx, NY.; Clinical IT Research & Development, Montefiore Information Technology, Yonkers,  NY, USA.",7686791 [pii]; 10.1093/ajhp/zxae161 [doi],Goriacko P; Moskowitz A; Ferguson N; Khalique S; Hopkins U; Quinn N; Sinnett M; Bellin E,,"© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2024.

38965743,"Women and other people of childbearing potential living with HIV (WLHIV) have a  higher risk of adverse birth outcomes than those without HIV (WWHIV). A higher risk of anemia in WLHIV could partially explain this disparity. Using a birth outcomes surveillance study in Botswana, we emulated target trials corresponding to currently available or feasible interventions on anemia. The first target trial evaluated 2 interventions: initiate multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS), and MMS or iron and folic acid supplementation by 24 weeks gestation. The remaining target trials evaluated the interventions: eliminate anemia before pregnancy; and jointly eliminate anemia before pregnancy and initiate MMS. We estimated the observed disparity in adverse birth outcomes between WLHIV and WWHIV and compared the observed disparity measure (ODM) to the counterfactual disparity measure (CDM) under each intervention. Of 137 499 individuals (22% WLHIV), the observed risk of any adverse birth outcome was 26.0% in WWHIV and 34.5% in WLHIV (ODM, 8.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-9.1%). Counterfactual disparity measures (95% CIs) ranged from 6.6% (4.8-8.4%) for the intervention to eliminate anemia and initiate MMS to 8.4% (7.7%-9.1%) for the intervention to eliminate anemia only. Preventing anemia and expanding MMS may reduce HIV disparities in birth outcomes, but interventions with greater impact should be identified.","Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA.; Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.; Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.; Infectious Disease, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, USA.; Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.; Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.; Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.; Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.; Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.; Harvard T.H.

37489623,"No randomized controlled trial has evaluated the effect of long-term alcohol  interventions on mortality. Results reported in existing observational studies may be subject to selection bias and time-varying confounding. Using data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health 1946-1951 birth cohort, collected regularly from 1996-2016, we estimated all-cause and cancer mortality had women been assigned various alcohol interventions (in categories ranging from 0 to >30 g/day ethanol, or reduced to ≤20 g/day if higher) at baseline, and had they maintained these levels of consumption. The cumulative risks for all-cause and cancer mortality were 5.6% (10,118 women followed for 20 years) and 2.9% (18 years), respectively. For all-cause and cancer mortality, baseline ethanol up to 30 g/day showed lower risk and >30 g/day showed higher risk relative to abstention. Had women sustainedly followed the interventions, a similar relationship was observed for all-cause mortality. However, the negative association observed for intakes ≤30 g/day and positive association for intakes >30 g/day was not evident for cancer mortality. Our findings suggest that all-cause mortality could have been lower than observed if this cohort of women had consumed some alcohol (no more than 30 g/day) rather than no consumption, but cancer mortality might not.",,7230358 [pii]; kwad164 [pii]; 10.1093/aje/kwad164 [doi],Yang Y; Hodge AM; Lynch BM; Dugué PA; Williamson EJ; Jayasekara H; Mishra G; English DR,,© The Author(s) 2023.

38548178,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to show the application of flexible statistical  methods in real-world cost-effectiveness analyses applied in the cardiovascular field, focusing specifically on the use of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors for hyperlipidemia. METHODS: The proposed method allowed us to use an electronic health database to emulate a target trial for cost-effectiveness analysis using multistate modeling and microsimulation. We formally established the study design and provided precise definitions of the causal measures of interest while also outlining the assumptions necessary for accurately estimating these measures using the available data. Additionally, we thoroughly considered goodness-of-fit assessments and sensitivity analyses of the decision model, which are crucial to capture the complexity of individuals' healthcare pathway and to enhance the validity of this type of health economic models. RESULTS: In the disease model, the Markov assumption was found to be inadequate, and a ""time-reset"" timescale was implemented together with the use of a time-dependent variable to incorporate past hospitalization history. Furthermore, the microsimulation decision model demonstrated a satisfying goodness of fit, as evidenced by the consistent results obtained in the short-term horizon compared with a nonmodel-based approach. Notably, proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors revealed their favorable cost-effectiveness only in the long-term follow-up, with a minimum willingness to pay of 39 000 Euro/life years gained. CONCLUSIONS: The approach demonstrated its significant utility in several ways. Unlike nonmodel-based or alternative model-based methods, it enabled to (1) investigate long-term cost-effectiveness comprehensively, (2) use an appropriate disease model that aligns with the specific problem under study, and (3) conduct subgroup-specific cost-effectiveness analyses to gain more targeted insights.","MOX-Modelling and Scientific Computing Laboratory, Department of Mathematics,  Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy; Biostatistics Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy; Aging Research Center, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.

40580781,"OBJECTIVE: Compare risk of intentional self-harm and overdose after visits for  opioid use disorder (OUD) followed by starting vs. not starting buprenorphine. METHODS: Records from four health systems identified visits during 1/1/2012-12/31/2019 by health system members aged 13 or older with OUD diagnosis and no recent OUD medication. Following a target-trial emulation approach, visits followed by buprenorphine dispensing within 7 days were matched to unexposed visits. Analyses compared risk of diagnosed self-harm injury or poisoning (primary outcome) as well as opioid-involved poisoning and any injury or poisoning (secondary outcomes) within 90 days. RESULTS: Among 183,809 visits by 30,955 patients, 15,508 (8.4 %) had buprenorphine dispensing within 7 days, and 2260 (1.2 %) had self-harm diagnosis within 90 days. Average duration of buprenorphine treatment before interruption was 44.3 days (SD 32.1). In primary intention-to-treat analyses using logistic regression and adjusting for baseline risk of self-harm, starting buprenorphine was not associated with significant difference in self-harm (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, 95 % CI 0.81-1.24) or opioid-involved poisoning (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 0.86-1.38). In secondary as-treated analyses censoring outcomes after treatment change, buprenorphine initiation was associated with no significant difference in hazard of self-harm (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.74, 95 % CI 0.53-1.02) and with significantly lower hazard of opioid-involved poisoning (HR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.43-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Among people with OUD, starting buprenorphine was not followed by lower risk of self-harm, likely reflecting frequent discontinuation and high risk of self-harm or overdose shortly after discontinuation. These findings reinforce the need to improve treatment continuity among those starting buprenorphine.","Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United  States of America.

39623344,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to analyse the effects of reducing Received Dose  Intensity (RDI) in chemotherapy treatment for osteosarcoma patients on their survival by using a novel approach. Previous research has highlighted discrepancies between planned and actual RDI, even among patients randomized to the same treatment regimen. To mitigate toxic side effects, treatment adjustments, such as dose reduction or delayed courses, are necessary. Toxicities are therefore risk factors for mortality and predictors of future exposure levels. Toxicity introduces post-assignment confounding when assessing the causal effect of chemotherapy RDI on survival outcomes, a topic of ongoing debate. METHODS: Chemotherapy administration data from BO03 and BO06 Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) in ostosarcoma are employed to emulate a target trial with three RDI-based exposure strategies: 1) standard, 2) reduced, and 3) highly-reduced RDI. Investigations are conducted between subgroups of patients characterised by poor or good Histological Responses (HRe), i.e., the strongest known prognostic factor for survival in osteosarcoma. Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) is first used to transform the original population into a pseudo-population which mimics the target randomized cohort. Then, a Marginal Structural Cox Model with effect modification is employed. Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) are ultimately measured as the difference between the Restricted Mean Survival Time of reduced/highly-reduced RDI strategy and the standard one. Confidence Intervals for CATEs are obtained using a novel IPTW-based bootstrap procedure. RESULTS: Significant effect modifications based on HRe were found. Increasing RDI-reductions led to contrasting trends for poor and good responders: the higher the reduction, the better (worsen) was the survival in poor (good) reponders. Due to their intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy, poor reponders could benefit from reduced RDI, with an average gain of 10.2 and 15.4 months at 5-year for reduced and highly-reduced exposures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces a novel approach to (i) comprehensively address the challenges related to the analysis of chemotherapy data, (ii) mitigate the toxicity-treatment-adjustment bias, and (iii) repurpose existing RCT data for retrospective analyses extending beyond the original trials' intended scopes.","Mathematical Institute, Leiden University, Leiden, 2333 CC, The Netherlands.  m.spreafico@math.leidenuniv.nl.; Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  2333 ZA, The Netherlands. m.spreafico@math.leidenuniv.nl.; MOX - Department of Mathematics, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, 20133, Italy.; Health Data Science Center, Human Technopole, Milan, 20157, Italy.; Mathematical Institute, Leiden University, Leiden, 2333 CC, The Netherlands.; Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,  2333 ZA, The Netherlands.; Trial and Data Center, Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht,  3584 CS, The Netherlands.",10.1186/s12874-024-02416-x [pii]; 2416 [pii]; 10.1186/s12874-024-02416-x [doi],Spreafico M; Ieva F; Fiocco M,,© 2024.

40439266,"As-needed blood pressure (BP) medication used to treat asymptomatic BP elevations  in the hospital may be harmful. However, its association with hospitalization costs remains unknown. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with target trial emulation and propensity-score matching to compare the total and subtype hospitalization costs for those who received as-needed BP medication (YES) versus not (NO) during a Veterans Affairs hospital stay between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2020. After matching (n = 25,455 per group), the as-needed YES group had a longer length of stay compared to the NO group. Hospitalizations in the YES group were associated with higher total and subtype hospitalization costs compared to the NO group. Similarly, individuals in the YES group had higher daily total hospital costs compared to the NO group, driven primarily by increased nursing and surgery costs. Our findings suggest that the expenditure implications of as-needed BP medication use merit further investigation.","Research Service, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, College of  Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.; Health Economics Resource Center (HERC), VA Palo Alto Healthcare System, Menlo  Park, California, USA.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, North Florida/South Georgia  Veterans Health System, Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Florida,  Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, and Center for Pharmaceutical Policy  and Prescribing, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.; North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System Geriatric Research Education  and Clinical Center, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Medical Service, Research Service and Geriatric Research Education and Clinical  Center, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.",10.1002/jhm.70089 [doi],Yang S; Westanmo A; Bounthavong M; Shorr R; Park H; Lo-Ciganic W; Canales M,ORCID: 0000-0002-1457-4668; ORCID: 0000-0002-8162-1348,Published 2025.

38573302,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of incident use of diuretics with  subsequent risk of incident bone fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a nationwide cohort of 863,339 US veterans receiving care from the VA health care system between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, with follow-up through June 30, 2018, we examined the association of incident diuretic use (overall, and separately by thiazide, loop, and potassium-sparing diuretics) with subsequent risk of incident bone fractures using multivariable Cox regression models while minimizing confounding by indication using a target trial emulation approach. RESULTS: Patients were 63.3±12.9 years old; 93.5% (n=807,180) were male; and 27.1% (n=233,996) were diabetic. Their baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 84.4±16.5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). Among 863,339 patients, 424,386 (49.2%) newly initiated diuretics, of which 77.4% (n=328,524), 22.5% (n=95,457), and 0.1% (n=405) were thiazide, loop, and potassium-sparing diuretic users, respectively. After multivariable adjustments, incident diuretic use (vs non-use) was significantly associated with higher risk of incident fracture (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.16). The association was most pronounced for loop diuretics (aHR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.44) but less evident for thiazide diuretics (aHR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.10) and was not significant for potassium-sparing diuretics (aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.52). The diuretic-fracture association was more evident in younger (vs older) patients, those with (vs without) corticosteroid use, and those with lower (vs higher) serum sodium levels. CONCLUSION: Incident use of diuretics, particularly loop diuretics, was independently associated with higher risk of incident bone fractures. Our findings suggest distinct pathophysiologic contributions of diuretics to bone metabolism and the need for careful attention to skeletal outcomes when initiating diuretics.","Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health  Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health  Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health  Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.; Center for Health System Improvement, Department of Medicine, University of  Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.; Division of Biostatistics, Department of Preventive Medicine, College of  Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Hypertension, and Kidney Transplantation, Department of  Medicine, University of California Irvine School of Medicine, Orange, CA, USA; Tibor Rubin Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Long Beach, CA, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Hypertension, and Kidney Transplantation, Department of  Medicine, University of California Irvine School of Medicine, Orange, CA, USA; Tibor Rubin Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Long Beach, CA, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health  Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA; Nephrology Section, Memphis VA Medical Center, Memphis, TN, USA.

38112680,"The paper introduces the Special Sections of the European Journal of Physical and  Rehabilitation Medicine dedicated to the 5(th) Methodological Meeting of Cochrane Rehabilitation. It introduces Cochrane Rehabilitation; its vision, mission and goals; discusses why the Methodological Meetings were created; and reports on their organisation and previous outcomes. The core content of this editorial is the 5(th) Methodological Meeting held in Milan in September 2023. The original title for this meeting was ""The Rehabilitation Evidence Ecosystem: useful study designs."" The focus of the Milan meeting was informed by the lessons learned by Cochrane Rehabilitation in the past few years, by the new rehabilitation definition for research purposes, by the collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), and by the REH-COVER (Rehabilitation COVID-19 Evidence-Based Response) action. During the Meeting, participants discussed the current methodological evidence on the following: RCTs in rehabilitation coming from meta-epidemiological studies; observational study designs - specifically the IDEAL Framework (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study) and its potential implementation in rehabilitation and the Target Trial Emulation framework: Single Case Experimental Designs; complex intervention studies: health services research studies, and studies using qualitative approaches. The Meeting culminated in the development of a first version of a ""road map"" to navigate the evidence production in rehabilitation according to the previous discussions. The Special Sections' papers present all topics discussed at the meeting, and a methodological paper about choosing the right research question, presenting final results and the ""road map"" for evidence production in rehabilitation.","Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University &quot;La  Statale&quot;, Milan, Italy.; IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Milan, Italy.; IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Milan, Italy.; Rehabilitation Teaching and Research Unit, Department of Medicine, University of  Otago, Wellington, New Zealand.; Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine, Medical School, Martin-Luther-University  Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.; IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, Milan, Italy - carienti@dongnocchi.it.; Institute for Disability and Rehabilitation Research and Faculty of Health  Sciences, Ontario Tech University, Oshawa, ON, Canada.",S1973-9087.23.08338-7 [pii]; 8338 [pii]; 10.23736/S1973-9087.23.08338-7 [doi],Negrini S; Kiekens C; Levack WM; Meyer-Feil T; Arienti C; Côté P,,,,Participants in the 5th Cochrane Rehabilitation Methodological Meeting,Conflicts of interest: The authors certify that there is no conflict of interest  with any financial organization regarding the material discussed in the manuscript.,,2023/12/19 11:11,20240301,20231219,2024 Feb,2023/12/19 19:52,,,"Negrini, Stefano; Kiekens, Carlotte; Levack, William M; Meyer-Feil, Thorsten; Arienti, Chiara; Côté, Pierre","Armijo-Olivo, Susan; Banfi, Giuseppe; Battel, Irene; Bricca, Alessio; Caronni, Antonio; Castellini, Greta; Ceravolo, Maria G; Colvin, Christopher; Cordani, Claudio; Cusick, Anne; Dan, Bernard; DE Groote, Wouter; Del Furia, Matteo J; Every-Palmer, Susanna; Ferriero, Giorgio; Feys, Peter; Gianola, Silvia; Gimigliano, Francesca; Gross, Doug; Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Hoogeboom, Thomas; Innocenti, Tiziano; Jette, Alan; Juhl, Carsten B; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Liguori, Sara; Machalicek, Wendy; Martin, Rachelle; Merlo, Federico; Minozzi, Silvia; Miranda, Luca; Mosconi, Bianca; Nudo, Randolph J; Oral, Aydan; Pennestrì, Federico; Puljak, Livia; Røe, Cecilie; Scarano, Stefano; Schmitz, Sandra; Shearer, Heather; Todhunter-Brown, Alex; Walshe, Margaret; Wong, Jessica",,1,Armijo-Olivo S; Banfi G; Battel I; Bricca A; Caronni A; Castellini G; Ceravolo MG; Colvin C; Cordani C; Cusick A; Dan B; DE Groote W; Del Furia MJ; Every-Palmer S; Ferriero G; Feys P; Gianola S; Gimigliano F; Gross D; Gutenbrunner C; Hoogeboom T; Innocenti T; Jette A; Juhl CB; Lazzarini SG; Liguori S; Machalicek W; Martin R; Merlo F; Minozzi S; Miranda L; Mosconi B; Nudo RJ; Oral A; Pennestrì F; Puljak L; Røe C; Scarano S; Schmitz S; Shearer H; Todhunter-Brown A; Walshe M; Wong J,1973-9095,1973-9087,1973-9087,101465662,European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,eng,10.23736/S1973-9087.23.08338-7 [doi],20240316,Humans; *Ecosystem; *Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine; Research Design,2024/03/01 06:44,,,,,,NLM,130-134,,2023/12/19 11:11,2024/03/01 06:44,,2023/12/19 00:00,2023/12/19 19:52,,Italy,PMC10938939,2023/12/19,ppublish,Journal Article; Observational Study,,IM,,Eur J Phys Rehabil Med. 2024 Feb;60(1):130-134. doi:  10.23736/S1973-9087.23.08338-7.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study employed target trial emulation and incident user design, utilizing the TriNetx database (2009-2024). Early beta-blocker initiation (within days 1 and 7) was compared with no initiation using 1:1 greedy propensity score matching. The outcomes included all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation/flutter, stroke, and safety endpoints. Hospitalization for bone fracture and acute appendicitis served as falsification endpoints. In the intention-to-treat analysis, outcomes were analyzed over 5 years using Cox-proportional hazards. RESULTS: Out of 11,681 matched patients per group, beta-blocker therapy was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.09-1.18]). No significant differences were found in hospitalization for myocardial infarction (HR: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.97-1.09]), stroke (HR: 0.98 [95% CI: 0.91-1.05]), heart failure (HR: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.95-1.03]), and atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.93-1.01]). Hospitalization for hypotension was higher with beta-blockers (HR: 1.10 [95% CI: 1.06-1.14]). Hospitalization for bone fracture (HR: 1.02 [95% CI: 0.85-1.22]) and acute appendicitis (HR: 1.17 [95% CI: 0.95-1.45]) showed no significant associations. Several sensitivity analyses showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: Early beta-blocker initiation after PCI for stable CAD with preserved LVEF was associated with higher mortality, with no impact on cardiovascular events.","Department of Cardiology, Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center,  Houston, Texas, USA.

40617484,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition (ARNI) reduces mortality and  morbidity in chronic heart failure, but its efficacy in acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains uncertain. This study compares ARNI versus angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in acute MI patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This cohort study used a target trial emulation approach to include acute MI patients between 2019 and 2022 from the Tianjin Health and Medical Data Platform, China. Eligible patients newly prescribed ARB or ARNI during hospitalization were matched 1:1 using propensity scores. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Time-dependent hazard ratio (HR) was used to the explore potential benefit window of ARNI. The matched cohort included 10,480 patients (5240 per group) for intention-to-treat analysis, with 701 deaths (6.7 %) recorded. Compared with ARB, ARNI was significantly associated with a lower 30-day mortality risk (HR: 0.68, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.88) but showed no association with 1-year mortality (HR: 0.99, 95 % CI: 0.85-1.14). Exploratory analysis indicates that the beneficial effect of ARNI extends to 60 days (HR: 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.52-0.88). No significant differences were observed for recurrent MI (HR: 0.98, 95 % CI: 0.87-1.10) or stroke (HR: 1.15, 95 % CI: 0.98-1.35). Subgroup analysis indicated a particular benefit of ARNI in heart failure patients at 60 days (HR: 0.75, 95 % CI: 0.58-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute MI, ARNI was associated with improved survival compared to ARB within the first 60 days. This survival benefit diminished over time, with no significant difference observed at 1-year follow-up.","Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital Airport Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan  Road, Heping District, Tianjin 300052, China.

40390384,"BACKGROUND: Antidepressants are prescribed for depression among older adults but  might increase the risk of motor vehicle crash (MVC) through adverse effects (AEs) like sedation, dizziness, and blurred vision. Antidepressant subclasses may have different MVC risks since AE risks vary across subclasses. Our objective was to estimate the comparative one-year risks of MVC upon initiating atypical (AA) or tricyclic (TCA) versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. METHODS: We emulated 470 sequential target trials each week from January 6, 2008, through January 1, 2017, using Medicare fee-for-service claims linked to New Jersey police-reported MVCs and driver's licensing data. Our sequential target trial emulation included older adults aged ≥ 66 years with a recent diagnosis of depression who initiated AAs, SSRIs, or TCAs. The unit of analysis was the ""person-trial"" a unique instance of a person in a sequential trial. Using inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted Kaplan-Meier estimators to account for potential confounding and selection bias, we estimated the intention-to-treat cumulative incidence and risk ratios (RRs) of MVC over 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 13,034 person-trials from 11,604 persons (median [first quartile, third quartile] age: 76.0 [71.0, 82.0] years, 69.8% female, 89.4% non-Hispanic White race). There were 31 (37.6 [95% confidence limits {CLs} 20.3, 59.5] per 1000), 65 (37.6 [95% CLs 25.7, 47.7] per 1000), and 380 (38.0 [95% CLs 24.1, 39.7] per 1000) MVCs among 644 TCA-treated, 2130 AA-treated, and 10,260 SSRI-treated person-trials, respectively. The adjusted RRs were 0.99 (95% CLs 0.72, 1.56) comparing AAs versus SSRIs and 0.99 (95% CLs 0.56, 1.86) comparing TCAs versus SSRIs. CONCLUSION: We observed no differences in the one-year risk of MVC between antidepressant subclasses. When selecting among antidepressant subclasses to manage depression in older adults, MVC risk should not guide prescribing decisions, and other considerations should take precedence.","Department of Epidemiology, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence,  Rhode Island, USA.; Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research, Department of Health Services,  Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence,  Rhode Island, USA.; Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research, Department of Health Services,  Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Center for Injury Research and Prevention, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research, Department of Health Services,  Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Department of Health Services Policy and Practice, Brown University School of  Public Health, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Department of Neurology, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Brown University School of Public Health,  Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Center for Injury Research and Prevention, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Division of Emergency Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Brown University Health, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Department of Psychiatry & Human Behavior, Brown University, Providence, Rhode  Island, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence,  Rhode Island, USA.; Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research, Department of Health Services,  Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Center of Innovation in Long-Term Services and Supports, Providence Veterans  Affairs Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.; Department of Pharmacy, Brown University Health, Rhode Island Hospital,  Providence, Rhode Island, USA.",10.1111/jgs.19527 [doi],Khan MA; Joyce NR; Pfeiffer MR; Riester MR; Ott BR; Oganisian A; Curry AE; Margolis SA; Zullo AR,ORCID: 0009-0002-0604-5595; ORCID: 0000-0001-7611-5494; ORCID: 0000-0002-4899-7116; ORCID: 0000-0003-1673-4570,© 2025 The American Geriatrics Society.,,,,,2025/05/20 03:13,,20250520,2025 May 20,2025/05/20 06:28,,,"Khan, Marzan A; Joyce, Nina R; Pfeiffer, Melissa R; Riester, Melissa R; Ott, Brian R; Oganisian, Arman; Curry, Allison E; Margolis, Seth A; Zullo, Andrew R",,R01AG065722/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; R01AG077620/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; R01AG079295/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; R01 AG077620/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; R01 AG079295/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; R01 AG065722/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States,,,1532-5415,0002-8614,,7503062,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,eng,10.1111/jgs.19527 [doi],20250720,,2025/05/20 06:28,,,,aging; antidepressants; comparative safety; motor vehicle crash; sequential target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,,2025/04/20 00:00,2025/05/20 03:13,2025/05/20 06:28,2025/04/09 00:00 [revised],,2025/05/20 06:28,2025/02/13 00:00,United States,,,aheadofprint,Journal Article,,IM,,J Am Geriatr Soc. 2025 May 20. doi: 10.1111/jgs.19527.,Publisher,J Am Geriatr Soc,Effects of Initiating Different Antidepressant Subclasses on Motor Vehicle Crash  Risk Among Older Adults With Depression.,,,,
40661263,"IMPORTANCE: Antidepressants are recommended as the initial choice of treatment  for moderate and severe depression, but the choice of antidepressant class can be challenging, with the possibility of serious adverse events such as increased suicidality with antidepressant initiation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of polygenic scores in predicting heterogeneous effects of antidepressants on suicidal thoughts. DESIGN: Using genetic and clinical data on both children and adults with major depressive disorder from the All of Us Research Program, we used a target trial emulation framework to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of antidepressants on suicidal thoughts across genetic characteristics. SETTING: Longitudinal cohort from the All of Us Research Program. PARTICIPANTS: More than 7,000 patients, both children and adults, with major depressive disorder. INTERVENTIONS: The initiation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), compared to the initiation of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and bupropion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The effects of antidepressants on suicidal thoughts, as well as subgroup effects across polygenic scores (PGSs) of various psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: Patients with higher PGS for psychiatric disorders, particularly for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), were more likely than those with lower scores to experience suicidal thoughts with the initiation of SSRIs, relative to bupropion (hazard ratio 1.66, 95%CI, 1.30-2.12, for participants with ADHD PGS higher than median vs. hazard ratio 1.06, 95%CI, 0.81-1.38, for participants with ADHD PGS lower than median; P-for-interaction, 0.01). We observed a similar trend for schizophrenia, although the interaction was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 1.52, 95%CI, 1.19-1.93, for participants with schizophrenia PGS higher than median vs. hazard ratio 1.1.17, 95%CI, 0.89-1.53, for participants with ADHD PGS lower than median; P-for-interaction, 0.16). We did not observe differences in the effects of SSRIs relative to SNRIs across PGSs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders may, at least partially, underlie the heterogeneity in the risk of suicidal thoughts with antidepressant use. In the personalized medicine framework, PGSs for various psychiatric disorders may help tailor antidepressants to each patient to avoid serious adverse effects such as suicidal thoughts. KEY POINTS: Question : How much do polygenic scores of psychiatric diseases predict the heterogeneity in the effects of antidepressants on suicidal thoughts? Findings : The genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders may, at least partially, underlie the heterogeneity in the risk of suicidal thoughts with antidepressant use. Meaning : Polygenic scores for psychiatric disorders may help tailor antidepressants to each patient to avoid suicidal thoughts with their initiation, contributing to personalized psychiatry.",,2024.11.02.24316657 [pii]; 10.1101/2024.11.02.24316657 [doi],Goto R; Naito T; Skokauskas N; Inoue K,ORCID: 0000-0002-4164-0990,,,,,,2025/07/15 04:57,,20250519,2025 May 19,2025/07/15 06:27,,,"Goto, Ryunosuke; Naito, Tatsuhiko; Skokauskas, Norbert; Inoue, Kosuke",,,,,,,,101767986,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,eng,2024.11.02.24316657 [pii]; 10.1101/2024.11.02.24316657 [doi],20250715,,2025/07/15 06:28,,,,,,NLM,,,2025/07/15 04:57,2025/07/15 06:28,,2025/07/14 00:00,2025/07/15 06:27,,United States,PMC12258772,2025/07/14,epublish,Journal Article; Preprint,,,,medRxiv [Preprint]. 2025 May 19:2024.11.02.24316657. doi:  10.1101/2024.11.02.24316657.,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,medRxiv,Polygenic scores for precision psychiatry: a study on the effect heterogeneity of  antidepressants.,,,,
39709180,"OBJECTIVES: To examine transitions to a nursing home among residents of assisted  living relative to community-dwelling home care recipients. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study emulating a target trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Linked, individual-level health system data were obtained from older adults (aged ≥65 years) who made an incident application for a bed in a nursing home in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2019, and were followed until December 31, 2019. METHODS: Residency in assisted living was compared with only community-dwelling home care. Any long-stay (≥90 days) and short-stay (<90 days) transitions to a nursing home were examined. Inverse probability weighted pooled logistic regression models were used to generate marginal cumulative incidence curves under each exposure status that were standardized by the covariates. RESULTS: This study included 10,012 residents of assisted living [mean (SD) aged 88.7 (6.26) years, 75% female] and 131,679 home care recipients [mean (SD) aged 84.8 (7.43) years, 63% female] who applied for a bed in a nursing home (N = 141,691; 95,744.6 person-years). There were 6049 transitions among applicants from assisted living and 85,190 transitions among applicants who were home care recipients to a nursing home. The 5-year absolute risk reduction was 110 transitions to a nursing home per 1000 older adult applicants if all applicants resided in assisted living (95% CI, 71-148). Residency in assisted living resulted in a 12.7% relative decrease in the 5-year risk of any transition to a nursing home had all applicants resided in assisted living (95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Residents of assisted living were less likely to transition to a nursing home, despite equivalent clinical complexity and health care needs. The integration of assisted living into the continuum of care from the community to institutionalized nursing homes would better inform health system capacity and planning.","Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation, Arizona State University,  Phoenix, AZ, USA; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Bruyère Health Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

39760735,"OBJECTIVE: Specific modifiable factors (e.g., screen time [ST], sleep duration,  physical activity, or social connections) are targets for reducing depression risk in adults. However, research in adolescents lacks causal inference implementations, as prevention trials are costly and often prohibitive. Emulating randomized trials with observational data enables inference regarding hypothetical interventions on modifiable factors that reduce depression risk, in general and at-risk populations. METHOD: Data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (N = 8,699) and the Generation R (N = 3,739) studies were leveraged for modifiable factors (age 10) and internalizing symptoms (age 12-14). We (a) tested prospective associations of each modifiable factor with internalizing symptoms under target trial emulation (TTE) and (b) used G-formula to estimate the potential effects on internalizing symptoms if hypothetical interventions were implemented. Analyses were conducted in the full sample (universal prevention setting) and at-risk youth (selective and indicated prevention setting). RESULTS: First, under TTE, only ST associated with internalizing symptoms. Second, in the universal prevention setting, adhering to more stringent ST guidelines (0-1 hr) decreased internalizing symptoms by 0.10-0.16 SDs while following more lenient guidelines (3-4 hr) increased them by 0.07-0.09 SDs, compared to existing guidelines (2 hr). Such changes were greater in the indicated (subclinical symptom) prevention settings and robust to residual confounding. Restricting physical activity reduced internalizing risk in the indicated setting, but findings were not robust.

39415047,"BACKGROUND: During the 2021-22 academic year, Massachusetts supported several  in-school testing programs to facilitate in-person learning. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines became available to all school-aged children and many were infected with SARS-CoV-2. There are limited studies evaluating the impacts of these testing programs on SARS-CoV-2 cases in elementary and secondary school settings. The aim of this state-wide, retrospective cohort study was to assess the impact of testing programs and immunity on SARS-CoV-2 case rates in elementary and secondary students. METHODS: Community-level vaccination and cumulative incidence rates were combined with data about participation in and results of in-school testing programs (test-to-stay, pooled surveillance testing). School-level impacts of surveillance testing programs on SARS-CoV-2 cases in students were estimated using generalized estimating equations within a target trial emulation approach stratified by school type (elementary/middle/high). Impacts of immunity and vaccination were estimated using random effects linear regression. RESULTS: Here we show that among N = 652,353 students at 2141 schools participating in in-school testing programs, surveillance testing is associated with a small but measurable decrease in in-school positivity rates. During delta, pooled testing positivity rates are higher in communities with higher cumulative incidence of infection. During omicron, when immunity from prior infection became more prevalent, the effect reversed, such that communities with lower burden of infection during the earlier phases of the pandemic had higher infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Testing programs are an effective strategy for supporting in-person learning. Fluctuating levels of immunity acquired via natural infection or vaccination are a major determinant of SARS-CoV-2 cases in schools.","VA Boston Center for Healthcare Optimization and Implementation Research (CHOIR),  Boston, MA, US. wbranche@bidmc.harvard.edu.; VA Boston Healthcare System, Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious  Diseases, Boston, MA, US. wbranche@bidmc.harvard.edu.; Harvard Medical School, Department of Medicine, Boston, MA, US.  wbranche@bidmc.harvard.edu.; School of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, Binghamton University,  State University of New York, New York, NY, US.; Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City,  UT, US.; IDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Healthcare System, Salt Lake City,  UT, US.; School of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, Binghamton University,  State University of New York, New York, NY, US.; CIC Health, Cambridge, MA, US.; Reliant Medical Group, Worchester, MA, US.; UMass Medical School, Department of Pediatrics, Worchester, MA, US.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School  of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, US.",10.1038/s43856-024-00619-3 [pii]; 619 [pii]; 10.1038/s43856-024-00619-3 [doi],Branch-Elliman W; Ertem MZ; Nelson RE; Danesharasteh A; Berlin D; Fisher L; Schechter-Perkins EM,ORCID: 0000-0002-9658-5124,© 2024.

39750005,"BACKGROUND: Deprescribing antihypertensives is of growing interest in geriatric  medicine, yet the impact on functional status is unknown. We emulated a target trial of deprescribing antihypertensive medications compared with continued use on functional status measured by activities of daily living (ADL) in a long-term care population. METHODS: We included 12,238 Veteran Affairs long-term care residents age 65+ who had a stay ≥ 12 weeks between 2006 and 2019. After 4+ weeks of stable antihypertensive medication use, residents were classified as either deprescribed antihypertensives (reduced ≥ 1 medication or ≥ 30% dose) or continued users. Residents were followed up for 2 years, or censored at discharge, admission to hospice, protocol deviation (per-protocol analysis only), or Sept 30, 2019. The outcome was ADL dependencies (scored 0-28; higher score = worse functionality), assessed approximately every 3 months. Our primary approach was to estimate per-protocol effects using linear mixed-effects regressions with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighting, overall and stratified by dementia status. We estimated intention-to-treat effects as a secondary analysis. RESULTS: In long-term care residents, ADL scores worsened by a mean of 0.29 points (95%CI = 0.27, 0.31) per 3 months and antihypertensive deprescribing did not impact this worsening (difference between groups -0.04 points every 3 months, 95%CI = -0.15, 0.06). In the non-dementia subgroup, ADL worsened by 0.15 points (95%CI = 0.11, 0.19) every 3 months. However, residents who were deprescribed showed a slightly improved ADL score over time while the continued users showed ADL decline (difference between groups -0.23 points every 3 months, 95%CI = -0.43, -0.03). Deprescribing was not associated with ADL change in the dementia subgroup. The intention-to-treat results were not meaningfully different. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive deprescribing did not have a deleterious effect on functional status in long-term care residents with or without dementia. This may be reassuring to residents and clinicians who are considering antihypertensive medication reduction or discontinuation in long-term care settings.","Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California, USA.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Health Economics Resource Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto,  California, USA.; Stanford-Surgery Policy Improvement Research Education Center, Department of  Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Pharmacy Practice and Administration, Ernest Mario School of  Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.; Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Treatment Science, Institute for Health,  Health Care Policy and Aging Research, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California, USA.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of  Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Section of Geriatrics, Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Stanford  University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles,  California, USA.; Center for Innovation to Implementation, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo  Alto, California, USA.; Department of Health Policy, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California, USA.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California, USA.",10.1111/jgs.19342 [doi],Liu X; Graham LA; Jing B; Dave CV; Li Y; Kurella Tamura M; Steinman MA; Lee SJ; Liu CK; Abdel Magid HS; Manja V; Fung K; Odden MC,ORCID: 0000-0002-9564-9480; ORCID: 0000-0001-6592-7550; ORCID: 0000-0002-5974-3648,© 2025 The American Geriatrics Society.,,,Conflict of Interest MKT has received honoraria from the American Federation of  Aging Research and serves as Associate Editor at CJASN.

40556309,"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of associations between glucocorticoid treatment and  adverse psychiatric and suicidal behaviour outcomes, large-scale observational evidence for serious outcomes is lacking. AIMS: To assess the risk of psychiatric and suicidal behaviour outcomes during glucocorticoid treatment. METHOD: Using Swedish population registers, we identified 1 105 964 individuals aged 15-54 years who collected a glucocorticoid prescription in oral form between 2006 and 2020. We investigated associations with a range of psychiatric outcomes: unplanned specialist healthcare contacts due to depressive, bipolar, anxiety or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders; and deaths by suicide or unplanned specialist healthcare contacts due to self-harm ('suicidal behaviour'). We estimated hazard ratios from Cox proportional hazards models in a medication-only cohort by comparing outcome rates during and outside treated periods within individuals. We further identified individuals with an autoimmune or gastrointestinal autoimmune disorder diagnosis and compared hazards of the outcomes between those who did and did not initiate a glucocorticoid using a target trial emulation approach. RESULTS: We found increased risks for psychiatric outcomes, with within-individual hazard ratios ranging from 1.08 (95% CI, 1.00-1.16) for depressive disorders to 1.23 (95% CI, 1.12-1.36) for bipolar disorder and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.20-1.31) for anxiety disorders. We found no clear association with suicidal behaviour (hazard ratio: 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96-1.17). These findings were similar when stratified by age and gender. Within-individual associations were attenuated in those diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. The risk of anxiety and bipolar disorder outcomes appeared particularly elevated in the first weeks of treatment. Absolute rates were modestly elevated during treatment, and higher in those with a history of psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Glucocorticoid treatment is associated with elevated risks of serious psychiatric outcomes, including the onset and relapse of common psychiatric disorders. Individuals with psychiatric histories may require additional monitoring during glucocorticoid treatment.","Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, UK.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden.; Department of Forensic Psychiatry, University of Eastern Finland, Niuvanniemi  Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden.; Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.; The Children's Hospital for Wales, Cardiff, UK.; Cardiff University School of Medicine, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, UK.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden.; School of Medical Sciences, Örebro University, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden.; Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, UK.; Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.",S000712502500128X [pii]; 10.1192/bjp.2025.128 [doi],Lagerberg T; Gustafsson TT; Molero Y; Forton J; Sariaslan A; Chang Z; Larsson H; Lichtenstein P; Fazel S,ORCID: 0000-0003-2480-0216; ORCID: 0000-0002-5383-5365,,,,DISCLOSURES The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,,2025/06/25 01:23,,20250625,2025 Jun 25,2025/06/25 06:25,,,"Lagerberg, Tyra; Gustafsson, Tapio T; Molero, Yasmina; Forton, Julian; Sariaslan, Amir; Chang, Zheng; Larsson, Henrik; Lichtenstein, Paul; Fazel, Seena",,202836/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom,,,1472-1465,0007-1250,0007-1250,0342367,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,eng,10.1192/bjp.2025.128 [doi],20250709,,2025/06/25 06:25,EMS204641,,,Bipolar disorder; corticosteroid; depression; pharmacoepidemiology; suicidal behaviour,NOTNLM,NLM,1-8,,2025/06/25 01:23,2025/06/25 06:25,,2025/07/07 00:00,2025/06/25 06:25,,England,PMC7617852,2025/07/07,aheadofprint,Journal Article,,IM,,Br J Psychiatry. 2025 Jun 25:1-8. doi: 10.1192/bjp.2025.128.,Publisher,Br J Psychiatry,Oral glucocorticoids and risk of psychiatric and suicidal behaviour outcomes:  population-based cohort study.,,,,
40178880,"Observational studies evaluating the effectiveness of cancer screening are often  biased due to non-alignment at time zero, which can be avoided by target trial emulation (TTE). We aimed to illustrate this by evaluating site-specific effectiveness of screening colonoscopy regarding colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. Based on a German health care database, we assessed the effect of screening colonoscopy vs. no screening colonoscopy in preventing CRC in the distal and the proximal colon over 12 years of follow-up in 55-69-year-old persons. We compared four different study designs: cohort and case-control study, each with/without alignment at time zero. In both analyses with time zero-alignment, screening colonoscopy showed a rather similar effectiveness in reducing the incidence of distal and proximal CRC (cohort analysis: 32% (95% CI: 27-37%) vs. 28% (20-35%); case-control analysis: 27% vs. 33%). Both analyses without alignment suggested a difference by site: Incidence reduction regarding distal and proximal CRC, respectively, was 65% (61-68%) vs. 37% (31-43%) in the cohort analysis and 77% (67-84%) vs. 46% (25-61%) in the case-control analysis. Violations of basic design principles can substantially bias the results of observational studies. In our example, it falsely suggested a much stronger preventive effect of colonoscopy in the distal vs. the proximal colon.

40602532,"AIMS: To evaluate the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors  (SGLT2i) on dialysis, cardiovascular, and mortality risks in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Using a target trial emulation within the TriNetX U.S. network (2015-2022), we identified 31,070 patients with both PKD and T2D. Three emulated trials were constructed via propensity score matching: SGLT2i vs. non-users (n = 2640 pairs), SGLT2i vs. DPP-4 inhibitors (n = 2016), and SGLT2i vs. GLP-1 receptor agonists (n = 1870). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Compared with non-users, SGLT2i users had lower risks of dialysis (HR: 0.657), acute kidney injury (AKI; HR: 0.896), and mortality (HR: 0.840). Against DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2i use was associated with reduced risks of dialysis (HR: 0.458), AKI (HR: 0.835), and mortality (HR: 0.813). Compared with GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2i users had a lower dialysis risk (HR: 0.531). CONCLUSION: SGLT2i use was associated with reduced risks of dialysis, AKI, and mortality in patients with PKD and T2D. These findings highlight a potential renal and survival benefit in this high-risk group. However, results were derived using an emulation protocol and propensity score methods based on electronic health records.

40450849,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Observational evidence of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness  (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection is often limited by differences in testing behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. This study aimed to estimate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection among students using data from a school district opt-in weekly testing program. METHODS: An observational, matched cohort study to emulate a target vaccine trial was conducted among students attending an urban school district in the Southeastern United States. Between 9/7/21 and 5/26/22, 9172 children, among 24,188 total students participating in the testing program, were followed from vaccination date, determined by state immunizations information systems (IIS) records, to first positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test, regardless of symptoms, conducted through the testing program. Hazard ratios and their 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models, and VE was calculated as (1-hazard ratio)*100. All analyses were stratified by age group (5-11 years and 12 years and older) and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Among students aged 5-11 years, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection within 60 days of first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine was 42.9 % (95 % CI, 7.1 % to 78.7 %) and waned to 20.7 % (95 %, CI 0.0 % to 41.8 %) by 180 days. Over the full study period, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 14.9 % (95 % CI, -5.0 % to 34.7 %). Among students 12 years and older, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was -5.0 % (95 % CI, -37.0 % to 26.5 %) over the full study period. Insufficient data was available to estimate VE within 60 days of vaccination in this age group. CONCLUSIONS: Among 5-11 year olds participating in a routine SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing program, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was modest immediately following vaccination but waned over the school year. This analysis limits biases found in traditional VE studies related to differential testing behaviors and allows estimation of VE against infection, regardless of symptoms.","Department of Epidemiology, Emory University, United States.

40575098,"BACKGROUND: School masking mandates were widely adopted as a pandemic control  measure, however, limited data are available regarding their effectiveness as a strategy for reducing burden of disease in the surrounding community. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of school masking policy de-adoption (mask-lifting) on SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates, hospitalizations, and deaths in the surrounding community. METHODS: Design: Retrospective observational study with an event study design, a difference-in-difference method; a target trial emulation (TTE) framework was applied as a secondary analysis. Cohort creation: Data collected from 9/2021 to 6/2022 on SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalizations, deaths and vaccination rates were combined with district-level masking policy data. Analysis: In the event study, the impact of masking policy de-adoption on SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100,000 county residents stratified by age during the 8-week period following the policy change was estimated. Effects on hospitalization and deaths per 1,000,000 residents were secondarily estimated. In a secondary analysis, a target trial emulation framework was applied to estimate average treatment effects. RESULTS: N = 3,970 districts composed of 53,453 schools were included in the cohort. In the event study, no consistent trends for COVID-19 case rates were identified for the whole cohort or for any age group. For the whole cohort, there was a statistically significant increase found 6-8 weeks following the policy change (maximum increase, 1.91 hospitalizations per 1,000,000 county residents); increases in hospitalizations were also found in the stratified analysis for all age groups, although absolute impacts were small. An increase in deaths was found during the period from 4 to 7 weeks following the policy change (maximum increase 0.62 deaths per 1,000,000 residents). In the stratified analysis, small increases in death rates were seen in 50-69 year olds (range, 0.088-1.49) and >70 year olds (range, 0.23-2.58) but not in younger groups. In the TTE framework, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were similar in control and intervention counties. CONCLUSION: This study evaluating the impact of lifting of mask mandates in schools, analyzed in two ways, was consistent results ranging from no impact to a small but statistically significant impact of the policy change on SARS-CoV-2 case and severe outcomes rates in the surrounding community. Findings can be used to inform future pandemic policy responses for elementary and secondary schools.","School of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, Binghamton University,  State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, United States.; School of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, Binghamton University,  State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, United States.; VA Boston Cooperative Studies Program, Boston, MA, United States.; UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; IDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Healthcare System, Salt Lake City,  UT, United States.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake  City, UT, United States.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston University School Chobanian and  Avedisian of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States.; Reliant Medical Group, Worcester, MA, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, UMass Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States.; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Tufts Medical Center,  Boston, MA, United States.; UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; VA Center for the Study of Healthcare Innovation, Implementation, and Policy  (CSHIIP), Los Angeles, CA, United States.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1579202 [doi],Ertem Z; Danesharasteh A; Anand ST; Jackson NJ; Nelson RE; Schechter-Perkins EM; Fisher L; Doron S; Branch-Elliman W,,"Copyright © 2025 Ertem, Danesharasteh, Anand, Jackson, Nelson, Schechter-Perkins,  Fisher, Doron and Branch-Elliman.",,,"ES-P, SD, and WB-E were all unpaid scientific advisors to the Massachusetts  Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and SD was an unpaid scientific advisor to the Massachusetts governor.

39739599,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of enrolling in Supportive Services for Veteran  Families (SSVF) on short- and long-term housing outcomes among Veterans experiencing housing instability. STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: We analyzed data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health record (EHR) between October 2015 and December 2018 using the target trial emulation framework. Veterans were included in one or more trials if they were 18 years or older, had recent evidence of housing instability, had received care in VA for at least 1 year, and had never before enrolled in SSVF. Patients who enrolled in SSVF after meeting eligibility were assigned to the treatment group, while patients who did not enroll in SSVF were assigned to a control group. We extracted patients' housing outcomes from the EHR and modeled the probability of being unstably housed each day while accounting for confounders and irregular visit times. DATA SOURCES AND ANALYTIC SAMPLE: We extracted housing status and covariates from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Housing instability was ascertained using a combination of structured data elements and natural language processing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified 238,059 unique patients who met the eligibility criteria for one or more trials. The risk of housing instability decreased in both arms over the three years after initiating a trial but was lower among SSVF enrollees, with a risk difference of -12.9% (95% confidence band -14.6%, -11.2%) on Day 120 and an attenuated difference of -2.4% (-4.0%, -0.7%) on Day 1095. CONCLUSIONS: SSVF is one of the largest rapid rehousing and homelessness prevention programs in the nation. We found that SSVF improves housing outcomes over the three years following enrollment, but the effect reduces over time. These findings can inform policy and program design for improving housing outcomes for homeless-experienced individuals.","IDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City,  Utah, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake  City, Utah, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine,  Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine,  Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans, Washington, DC, USA.; School of Social Work, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Bedford VA  Medical Center, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA.; National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans, Washington, DC, USA.; Birmingham VA Health Care System, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.; School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,  Alabama, USA.; IDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City,  Utah, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake  City, Utah, USA.; IDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City,  Utah, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake  City, Utah, USA.; IDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City,  Utah, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake  City, Utah, USA.; IDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City,  Utah, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake  City, Utah, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine,  Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake  City, Utah, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine,  Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans, Washington, DC, USA.; School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio,  Texas, USA.; National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans, Washington, DC, USA.; Department of Family Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los  Angeles, California, USA.; Office of Healthcare Transformation and Innovation, VA Greater Los Angeles  Healthcare System, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Health Policy & Management, Fielding School of Public Health,  University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.; National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans, Washington, DC, USA.; Birmingham VA Health Care System, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.; School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,  Alabama, USA.; UAB Heersink School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.; IDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City,  Utah, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake  City, Utah, USA.; National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans, Washington, DC, USA.",HESR14428 [pii]; 10.1111/1475-6773.14428 [doi],Chapman AB; Scharfstein D; Byrne T; Montgomery AE; Suo Y; Effiong A; Shorter C; Huebler S; Greene T; Tsai J; Gelberg L; Kertesz SG; Nelson RE,ORCID: 0000-0003-3711-2682; ORCID: 0000-0003-4824-0284; ORCID: 0000-0002-4420-3526; ORCID: 0000-0002-0329-648X; ORCID: 0000-0001-6101-8421,© 2025 The Author(s).

40003657,"Low back pain (LBP) is a potential complication after total hip arthroplasty  (THA). However, some studies suggest that THA not only alleviates joint pain but also resolves LBP in up to 88.2% of patients. Most of these observations are limited to short-term follow-ups. This study investigates the long-term relationship between THA and LBP, challenging the notion that THA resolves LBP. A retrospective review was conducted on 236 patients who underwent THA (2010-2020). Multiple statistical models were applied, including unadjusted unmatched, adjusted unmatched, adjusted matched, and target trial emulation with 7887 subjects, to evaluate LBP incidence. Of the 236 patients, 119 developed postoperative LBP. The unadjusted unmatched analysis showed a relative risk (RR) of 2.23 (95%CI: 1.5-3.2). Adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and recruitment period reduced the RR to 1.64 (95%CI: 1.0-2.6). The adjusted matched analysis showed an RR of 1.09 (95%CI: 0.4-3.0), while the target trial emulation simulated an RR of 1.03 (95%CI: 0.7-1.8), indicating no significant differences. Despite an apparent initial association, adjusted analyses do not support a significant long-term relationship between THA and LBP. No reduction in postoperative LBP incidence was observed, suggesting THA is safe regarding LBP risk but lacks a curative effect. Rigorous confounding adjustment is essential in retrospective studies.","Departmento de Fisiatría y Enfermería, iHealthy Research Group IIS Aragón,  Universidad de Zaragoza, C.

39572406,"Background and ObjectivesHearing aids may reduce the risk of dementia among  individuals with hearing loss. However, no evidence is available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of hearing aids use in reducing incident dementia. Using target trial emulation, we leveraged an existing longitudinal cohort study to estimate the association between hearing aids initiation and risk of dementia.Research Design and MethodsThe Health and Retirement Study was used to emulate target trials among non-institutionalized participants aged ≥50 years with self-reported hearing loss, without dementia at baseline, and without use of hearing aids in the previous 2 years. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted to estimate the risk of dementia associated with hearing aids initiation vs controls who did not initiate hearing aids. Pooled logistic regression models with inverse-probability of treatment and censoring weights were applied to estimate risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using 1000 sets of bootstrapping.ResultsAmong 2314 participants (328 in the intervention group and 1986 in the control group; average age: 72.3 ± 9.7 years, 49% women, and 81% White), after 8 years of follow-up, risk of dementia was significantly lower among individuals who initiated hearing aids (risk difference (RD): -0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.08, -0.01). A lower risk was observed particularly among adults aged 50-74 years, men, and individuals with cardiovascular disease.Discussion and ImplicationsHearing aids use was associated with a significant reduction of incident dementia. Future interventional studies are needed to further assess the effectiveness of hearing aids in preventing dementia.","Department of Family and Community Medicine, McGovern Medical School, University  of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.

40090935,"BACKGROUND: Bibliometric analysis often overlooks study-based components such as  study aims, design, and statistical methods. In this study, we propose a conceptual framework incorporating these study-based components with disease-based components for the bibliometric analysis of cancer articles using real-world data. This framework is a significant step forward in cancer research. We then investigated the distribution and temporal trends of these components for cancer articles using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) published from 2006 to 2022. METHODS: Study- and disease-based components were extracted and cross-validated. The distribution and temporal trends of these components were then presented. RESULTS: We analyzed 1232 articles and found a noticeable increase in the annual publication count from 2011 onward. This upward trend signified the growing momentum in cancer research. Cancer risk factors were the most studied (52%), followed by cancer outcomes (36%) and incidence/prevalence (3%). Among the publications on risk factors and outcomes, most were cohort studies (85%), followed by case-control studies (10.7%). In both study designs, the use of the propensity score method increased steadily from 2.4% in 2011 to 40% in 2022. The most frequently studied cancer site was ""all cancers or multiple cancers"" (25.6%), followed by breast (9.6%), hepatobiliary (9.2%), and colorectal cancers (8.8%). Among the top 10 cited articles, the first and fourth focused on whether suppressing hepatitis B viral load with nucleoside analogs could reduce hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence and incidence in chronic hepatitis B patients. The remaining eight examined the association between medications and cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Beyond citation metrics, our research underscores the importance of considering study-based and disease-based components in bibliometric analysis. These components form the foundation of the real-world data cancer research framework and have practical implications for diseases beyond cancers, providing a broader perspective for researchers and practitioners.","School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan,  ROC.; Department of Medical Education, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan,  ROC.; Graduate Institute of Physical Therapy, College of Medicine, Chang Gung  University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan,  Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan,  Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan,  Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan,  Taiwan, ROC.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan,  Taiwan, ROC.; Biostatistics Core Laboratory, Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung  University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, ROC.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,  Taoyuan, Taiwan, ROC.",02118582-202505000-00009 [pii]; 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000001227 [doi],Siu WHS; Lim AY; Liu JR; Chang SH; Chen WM; Li PR; See LC,,"Copyright © 2025, the Chinese Medical Association.",,,Conflicts of interest: The authors declare that they have no conflicts of  interest related to the subject matter or materials discussed in this article.,,2025/03/17 00:04,20250513,20250317,2025 May 1,2025/03/17 15:19,,,"Siu, Wing Hin Stanford; Lim, Ai Yin; Liu, Jia-Rou; Chang, Shu-Hao; Chen, Wei-Min; Li, Pei-Ru; See, Lai-Chu",,,5,,1728-7731,1726-4901,,101174817,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,eng,10.1097/JCMA.0000000000001227 [doi],20250513,"*Bibliometrics; Humans; *Neoplasms; Taiwan; Databases, Factual; National Health Programs; *Publications",2025/05/13 06:33,,,,Bibliometric analysis; Cancer; Interrupted time series; Taiwan National Health Insurance Research; Target trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,398-409,,2025/03/17 00:04,2025/05/13 06:33,,,2025/03/17 15:19,,Netherlands,,,ppublish,Journal Article,,IM,,J Chin Med Assoc. 2025 May 1;88(5):398-409. doi: 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000001227.

40645472,"BACKGROUND: The 2020 Multicentre Abdominal vs Vaginal Randomised Intervention of  Cerclage trial found that transabdominal cerclage placed via open laparotomy reduces the risk of spontaneous preterm birth before 32 weeks relative to transvaginal cerclage in a very high-risk obstetric population. It is not known whether the results of the trial generalize to obstetric populations with fewer risk factors, on average, for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth, or to patients without history of failed transvaginal cerclage (an inclusion criterium in the trial). OBJECTIVE: 1) To estimate the effect of transabdominal cerclage vs transvaginal cerclage on early preterm delivery (<34 weeks) among patients with history of cervical insufficiency at a quaternary care center; 2) to estimate the effect within a subgroup of patients without history of failed transvaginal cerclage; and 3) to describe associated complications of placement and delivery and neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We identified a cohort of adult singleton pregnancies who received history-indicated cerclage at a quaternary care center in the United States. The cohort consisted of patients with a history of ≥1 spontaneous deliveries (birth or fetal loss) <28 weeks and patients with a history of failed transvaginal cerclage, defined as ≥1 spontaneous preterm deliveries <34 weeks with cervical cerclage in situ. All eligible patients who received transabdominal cerclage were compared to a sample of eligible patients who received transvaginal cerclage. We performed survival analysis with inverse probability weights to adjust for potential sources of bias. Effects were estimated as risk difference, risk ratio, and 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses were performed among patients without a history of failed transvaginal cerclage. The risks of surgical, delivery, and neonatal outcomes were described. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight patients were included, of whom 87 received transabdominal cerclage (99% laparoscopic) and 101 received transvaginal cerclage. Twenty-six patients (30%) with transabdominal cerclage had no history of failed transvaginal cerclage, the majority of whom had additional clinical reasons why transabdominal cerclage was offered. After adjusting for confounding, the adjusted risk of early preterm delivery was 5.5% in the transabdominal group (95% confidence interval, 2.0%, 9.4%) and 18.7% in the transvaginal group (95% confidence interval, 6.8%, 31.4%), risk difference = -13.1% (95% confidence interval, -26.6%, -0.5%), and risk ratio = 0.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.10, 0.94). Among patients without history of failed transvaginal cerclage (N = 104 total, N = 26 in transabdominal group), the risk difference was -12.6% (-21.6%, -4.1%). Risks of placement and delivery complications were comparable across groups but included a few serious uterine complications in the transabdominal cerclage group. Neonatal intensive care unit admission occurred in 35% and 23% of neonates in the transabdominal and transvaginal groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among women with history of ≥1 preterm deliveries <28 weeks or failed transvaginal cerclage <34 weeks, transabdominal cerclage reduced the risk of preterm delivery <34 weeks compared to transvaginal cerclage, consistent with the Multicentre Abdominal vs Vaginal Randomised Intervention of Cerclage trial findings. Conclusions about efficacy among patients without history of failed transvaginal cerclage are limited by small sample size. Further research is necessary to understand whether the benefits of transabdominal cerclage in subgroups of patients outweigh risks of abdominal surgery and cesarean delivery.","Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts  General Hospital, Boston, MA; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

39579670,"Bovine Ephemeral Fever (BEF) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) that  presents a significant challenge to the cattle industry due to its economic impact, primarily through the loss of milk production in dairy cows. Vaccination is the predominant strategy for managing the disease. We recently showed a vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 60 % of a vaccine based on the Australian 919 BEFV isolate, with a natural challenge occurring shortly after the administration of the second dose of the vaccine. Still, there is a lack of data regarding the duration of protective immunity after vaccination and its potential enhancement after the administration of three and four vaccine doses. To answer these questions we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 850 cows (7 herds), analyzing the influence of different vaccination regimens on VE and a serosurvey of 71 cows to test the longevity of BEFV-specific serum-neutralizing antibodies (SNAb). We adopted a quantitative methodology for BEF diagnosis with the use of commercially validated precision dairy monitoring technologies for milk reduction identification. Survival analysis was used to analyze the vaccine dose effectiveness. A Cox regression mixed-effect model (COXME) was fitted to the data. The analysis demonstrated the following VE compared to zero vaccine doses: 82 % (p-value<0.001) for four doses, 66 % (p-value<0.026) for three doses and 39 % (p-value = 0.3) for two doses. Corroborating with the VE results, the four-dose regimen exhibited the highest geometric mean titer (GMT) value (4.45, CI(95%) = 3.99, 4.91), followed by the three-dose regimen (3.53, CI(95%) = 3.08,3.98), and the two-dose regimen (2.17, CI(95%) = 1.77,2.57). In light of these findings, we recommend vaccinating calves as early as four to six months old with two doses spaced one month apart, followed by a third and even fourth dose administered between six to 12 months later, ideally close to the onset of the high-risk season.","Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, The Robert H.

40533641,"AIM: The aim of this study was to analyse the real-world health and economic  effect of an outpatient screening and continuing-care programme for early detection and care of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) delivered through a selective contract between a large statutory health insurance company and ambulatory care physicians in the German health care system. METHODS: Building on methods of target trial emulation and programme impact evaluation, we used a quasi-experimental approach and health insurance claims data from 790,375 patients with T2D over a time horizon of 5.75 years. We applied a two-stage matching approach in which we exploited the staggered implementation of the selective contract across federal states in Germany to control for selection bias at the physician level and used propensity scores to control for selection bias at the patient level, where we considered socio-demographic, health consciousness-related, care-related, and comorbidity-related potential confounders in the matching process. RESULTS: Within a matched sample of 16,490 patients, over 1 year, enrolment into the programme increased the number of visits to primary care physicians (relative risk [RR]: 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.10), increased the frequency of prescriptions for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (RR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.12, 1.50) and for statins (RR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.03, 1.13) and decreased the risk of hospitalisations (RR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.84, 0.92). Outpatient costs in the enrolled patients were on average 14% (cost ratio: 1.14, 95% CI 1.09, 1.20) or €194.4 higher, but overall, the programme was budget neutral over a time horizon of 1 year. CONCLUSION: Investing in secondary prevention to detect and manage the early stages of microvascular complications is likely a cost-effective or cost-saving approach to improve health in patients with T2D.","TUM School of Medicine and Health, Technical University of Munich, Munich,  Germany. min.fan@tum.de.; Munich Center of Health Economics and Policy, Munich, Germany. min.fan@tum.de.; German Center of Diabetes Research (DZD), Munich, Germany. min.fan@tum.de.; TUM School of Medicine and Health, Technical University of Munich, Munich,  Germany.; Munich Center of Health Economics and Policy, Munich, Germany.; German Center of Diabetes Research (DZD), Munich, Germany.; TUM School of Medicine and Health, Technical University of Munich, Munich,  Germany.; Munich Center of Health Economics and Policy, Munich, Germany.; German Center of Diabetes Research (DZD), Munich, Germany.; Diabeteszentrum L1, Hameln, Germany.; TUM School of Medicine and Health, Technical University of Munich, Munich,  Germany.; Munich Center of Health Economics and Policy, Munich, Germany.; German Center of Diabetes Research (DZD), Munich, Germany.",10.1007/s40258-025-00978-5 [pii]; 10.1007/s40258-025-00978-5 [doi],Fan M; Stephan AJ; Hanselmann M; Lueg A; Laxy M,ORCID: 0000-0002-1846-1265,© 2025.

40467028,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a framework for conducting rigorous nonrandomized studies  of interventions in fertility treatment research, addressing their role as complements to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in evaluating treatment outcomes. DESIGN: Multidisciplinary expert consensus on best practices for nonrandomized studies of interventions, informed by advancements in novel methodologies, including causal inference. SUBJECTS: Patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) procedures, such as ovarian stimulation, laboratory techniques, and embryo transfer. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Guidance on methodological rigor, transparency, and relevance in nonrandomized studies of interventions study design and analysis. RESULTS: Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for determining the efficacy and safety of fertility treatment/ART interventions but can face logistical, practical, and sometimes ethical challenges. Nonrandomized studies of interventions, when conducted with high methodological rigor, complement RCTs by offering insights into real-world clinical practices and diverse patient populations. Key limitations of nonrandomized studies of interventions include susceptibility to confounding and selection bias, which require meticulous study design and advanced analytical techniques to address. Recent innovations, such as target trial emulation studies, have enhanced the validity of causal inferences based on nonrandomized studies of interventions. This article outlines 7 recommendations to improve the credibility of nonrandomized studies of interventions in ART research: clearly define research questions with precise estimands; design nonrandomized studies of interventions as emulated trials; use directed acyclic graphs to clarify causal assumptions; preregister study protocols; separate data analysis from study planning; incorporate negative controls to detect biases; and use appropriate analytical methods to account for confounding and selection bias. CONCLUSION: Integrating evidence from RCTs and well-conducted nonrandomized studies of interventions enhances clinical decision making in fertility treatment research. By adhering to these recommendations, researchers can improve the quality, transparency, and impact of nonrandomized studies of interventions, ultimately fostering robust, evidence-based clinical practices in fertility treatment/ART.","Merck Healthcare KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.

40472935,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury  (AKI) were methodologically limited. We herein investigated the AKI incidence, clinical outcomes, and economic impact of this condition on Japan's aging population using a robust, methodological approach to analyze information from two, large-scale, Japanese, healthcare databases. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data on 2007 and 2607 patients aged ≥18 years and registered with the Medical Data Vision (MDV) database and the JMDC, Inc. database, respectively, who received vancomycin ≥4 days. Target trial emulation was employed with 1:1 propensity score matching to compare the outcomes of patients with and without AKI. The primary outcomes included 30-day in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and direct medical costs. The KDIGO guidelines' definition of AKI was used. RESULTS: AKI occurred in 19.4 % (MDV) and 14.9 % (JMDC) of the cohorts with the median onset being five days. After propensity score matching (386 and 387 pairs for MDV and JMDC, respectively), the AKI group demonstrated significantly higher 30-day in-hospital mortality (odds ratio: 3.82 [95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.52-5.79] for MDV; 4.36 [95 % CI: 2.89-6.57] for JMDC; both P < .001), prolonged LOS (hazard ratio: 1.45 [95 % CI: 1.22-1.72] for MDV; 1.79 [95 % CI: 1.35-2.37] for JMDC; both P < .001), and higher daily direct medical costs per patient (cost ratio: 1.39 [95 % CI: 1.19-1.62] for MDV; 1.33 [95 % CI: 1.18-1.50] for JMDC; both P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin-associated AKI significantly increased mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and elevated healthcare costs. These findings can provide further impetus to effective vancomycin stewardship.","Department of Pharmacy, Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan;  Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Tokyo, Japan.

35697489,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of achieving a negative postinduction  antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCA) assay on the risk of relapse, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). METHODS: We emulated a target trial using observational data from the Mass General Brigham AAV cohort comparing patients who achieved versus did not achieve serological remission (negative ANCA assay) within 180 days of induction. Outcomes were relapse, ESRD or death within 5 years, obtained from medical records, the US Renal Data System and the National Death Index. We placed a 'clone' of each patient in both trial arms, censored those deviating from their assigned protocol and weighted each by the inverse probability of censoring. Outcomes were assessed by pooled logistic regression. RESULTS: The study included 506 patients with AAV. The mean age was 61 years (SD 18) and the majority were women (58%), white (87%), myeloperoxidase-ANCA+ (72%) and had renal involvement (68%). Rituximab (59%) or cyclophosphamide (33%) was most often used for induction treatment. Within 5 years, 81 (16%) died, 51 (10%) had ESRD and 64 (13%) had relapse. Patients treated to a negative ANCA assay within 180 days had HR 0.55 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.81) for relapse and HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.25) for the composite of ESRD or death within 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this emulated target trial from a large AAV cohort, achieving serological remission within 180 days of induction was associated with lower risk of relapse, but no statistically significant difference in ESRD or mortality outcomes.","Department of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts,  USA.; Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts,  USA.; Rheumatology Unit, Division of Rheumatology Allergy, and Immunology,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA zswallace@partners.org.",S0003-4967(24)18444-0 [pii]; 10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-222439 [doi],McDermott G; Fu X; Cook C; Ahola C; Doliner B; Hanberg J; Stone JH; Choi HK; Zhang Y; Wallace ZS,ORCID: 0000-0002-9750-5448; ORCID: 0000-0001-6588-9435; ORCID: 0000-0002-2862-0442; ORCID: 0000-0001-7638-0888; ORCID: 0000-0003-4708-7038,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

33783516,"IMPORTANCE: Several real-world oncology studies have produced findings that  contradict those from randomized clinical trials. Such disparities may be associated with methodological shortcomings. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between a shortened duration of adjuvant chemotherapy among individuals with stage III colon cancer using real-world data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study included individuals diagnosed with stage III colon cancer between January 2004 and December 2015 who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy at oncology clinics within the province of Alberta, Canada. Patients were identified through record linkage of various administrative databases and were followed up until September 2017. Eligibility criteria were modeled after those used in the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant (IDEA) trial. A target trial emulation and naive observational analysis were conducted. Results from both cohorts were benchmarked against findings from the IDEA trial. Data analysis was conducted from March to December 2020. EXPOSURE: A shortened duration of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) chemotherapy, defined as 3 to 5 months of treatment vs 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival assessed via vital statistics. The per-protocol hazard ratio (HR) was estimated using a weighted pooled logistic regression model. Subgroup analyses were conducted by treatment regimen (ie, FOLFOX vs CAPOX) and cancer stage (ie, T1-3 and N1 vs T4 or N2). RESULTS: From an initial cohort of 3086 patients, 485 (16%) were eligible for inclusion in the target trial analysis. The median age was 59 years (range, 19-81 years), and 230 (47%) were women. The maximum follow-up was 11.6 years. Median overall survival was not reached. A total of 90 patients (19%) died. The 5-year Kaplan Meier overall survival estimate was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.84). Estimates from the trial emulation were similar to those from the IDEA trial. For example, a shortened duration of adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with overall survival among patients prescribed CAPOX in the IDEA trial (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08) or in the trial emulation (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.43-2.14). In contrast, the naive observational analysis suggested that a shortened duration of CAPOX was significantly associated with worse survival (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.04-10.65). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the explicit emulation of a target trial better approximated results from an analogous well-conducted randomized clinical trial.","Oncology Outcomes Initiative, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary,  Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University  of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Cancer Care Alberta,  Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Oncology Outcomes Initiative, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary,  Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary,  Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University  of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary,  Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University  of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary,  Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary,  Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University  of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Cancer Care Alberta,  Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Oncology Outcomes Initiative, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary,  Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University  of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Cancer Care Alberta,  Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.",2777890 [pii]; zoi210133 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.3587 [doi],Boyne DJ; Cheung WY; Hilsden RJ; Sajobi TT; Batra A; Friedenreich CM; Brenner DR,,,JAMA Netw Open. 2021 Mar 1;4(3):e213845. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.3845.

39920062,"INTRODUCTION: Energy management education (EME) is a manualised, evidence-based  self-management education programme developed and delivered by occupational therapists for persons living with chronic disease-related fatigue. Studies have shown that EME can positively affect self-efficacy, fatigue impact and quality of life in persons with chronic conditions, while data on persons with long COVID are lacking.The primary aim is to evaluate if adding EME to the standard care improves outcomes in persons with long COVID-related fatigue. The secondary aim is to explore the energy management behavioural strategies applied in daily routines and investigate the influencing factors of implementing behavioural changes. The third aim is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of EME. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using observational data, we will emulate a prospective two-parallel arms target trial to assess whether adding EME to the standard care is associated with improved outcomes in patients with long COVID-related fatigue. The estimated sample size to detect a post-intervention difference of 1.5 points in self-efficacy to implement energy conservation strategies with 90% power (0.05 alpha) is 122 people (1:1 ratio).Persons with long COVID-related fatigue who follow EME as part of their standard care will be recruited and included in the experimental group (EG), while potential participants for the control group (CG) will be recruited from a register and prospectively matched to a participant in the EG by applying the propensity score technique. The 'standard of care' of the CG will include any intervention, except occupational therapy-based EME in peer groups. The causal contrast of interest will be the per-protocol effect. Four self-reported questionnaires (fatigue impact, self-efficacy in performing energy management strategies, competency in performing daily activities, health-related quality of life) will be administered at baseline (T0; week 0), after lesson 7 (T1; week 6), post-intervention (T2; week 14) and follow-up (T3, week 24). Our main assessment will be at T2. Disease-related and productivity cost data will be collected, and a cost-effectiveness profile of the EME intervention will be compared with standard care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the competent Swiss ethics commission.Findings will be reported (1) to the study participants; (2) to patient organisations and hospitals supporting EMERGE; (3) to funding bodies; (4) to the national and international occupational therapy community and healthcare policy; (5) will be presented at local, national, and international conferences and (6) will be disseminated by peer-review publications.","Department of Business Economics, Health and Social Care, Rehabilitation Research  Laboratory 2rLab, University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland, Manno, Switzerland ruth.hersche@supsi.ch.; Department of Business Economics, Health and Social Care, Rehabilitation Research  Laboratory 2rLab, University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland, Manno, Switzerland.; Department of Business Economics, Health and Social Care, University of Applied  Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland, Manno, Switzerland.; Department of Business Economics, Health and Social Care, University of Applied  Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland, Manno, Switzerland.; Department of Business Economics, Health and Social Care, Rehabilitation Research  Laboratory 2rLab, University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland, Manno, Switzerland.",bmjopen-2024-098574 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjopen-2024-098574 [doi],Hersche R; Weise A; Riggi E; Di Tanna GL; Barbero M,ORCID: 0000-0003-0160-9144,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

38504063,"Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation  (AFib) having CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 2. However, the benefits of OAC initiation in patients with AFib and cancer at different levels of CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc is unknown. We included patients with new AFib diagnosis and a record of cancer (breast, prostate, or lung) from the 2012-2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (n = 39,915). Risks of stroke and bleeding were compared between 5 treatment strategies: (1) initiated OAC when CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 1 (n = 6008), (2) CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 2 (n = 8694), (3) CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 4 (n = 20,286), (4) CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 6 (n = 30,944), and (5) never initiated OAC (reference group, n = 33,907). Confounders were adjusted using inverse probability weighting through cloning-censoring-weighting approach. Weighted pooled logistic regressions were used to estimate treatment effect [hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CIs)]. We found that only patients who initiated OACs at CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 6 had lower risk of stroke compared without OAC initiation (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.75). All 4 active treatment strategies had reduced risk of bleeding compared to non-initiators, with OAC initiation at CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 6 being the most beneficial strategy (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.44-0.55). In patients with lung cancer or regional/metastatic cancer, OAC initiation at any CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc level increased risk of stroke and did not reduce risk of bleeding (except for Regimen 4). In conclusion, among cancer patients with new AFib diagnosis, OAC initiation at higher risk of stroke (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 6) is more beneficial in preventing ischemic stroke and bleeding. Patients with advanced cancer or low life-expectancy may initiate OACs when CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 6.","Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Auburn University Harrison  College of Pharmacy, 4306d Walker Building, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.; Department of Pharmacy Practice, Auburn University Harrison College of Pharmacy,  Auburn, AL, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Auburn University Harrison  College of Pharmacy, 4306d Walker Building, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Auburn University Harrison  College of Pharmacy, 4306d Walker Building, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Auburn University College of Sciences  and Mathematics, Auburn, AL, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Auburn University Harrison  College of Pharmacy, 4306d Walker Building, Auburn, AL, 36849, USA. jzq0004@auburn.edu.",10.1007/s11239-024-02958-3 [pii]; 2958 [pii]; 10.1007/s11239-024-02958-3 [doi],Truong B; Hornsby L; Fox B; Chou C; Zheng J; Qian J,ORCID: 0000-0002-8654-5444; ORCID: 0000-0003-4624-9963,© 2024.

38496630,"Corticosteroids decrease the duration of organ dysfunction in a range of  infectious critical illnesses, but their risk and benefit are not fully defined using this construct. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to evaluate the association between usage of corticosteroids and mortality of patients with infectious critical illness by emulating a target trial framework. The study employed a novel stratification method with predictive machine learning (ML) subphenotyping based on organ dysfunction trajectory. Our analysis revealed that corticosteroids' effectiveness varied depending on the stratification method. The ML-based approach identified four distinct subphenotypes, two of which had a large enough sample size in our patient cohorts for further evaluation: ""Rapidly Improving"" (RI) and ""Rapidly Worsening,"" (RW) which showed divergent responses to corticosteroid treatment. Specifically, the RW group either benefited or were not harmed from corticosteroids, whereas the RI group appeared to derive harm. In the development cohort, which comprised of a combination of patients from the eICU and MIMIC-IV datasets, hazard ratio estimates for the primary outcome, 28-day mortality, in the RW group was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.96 - 1.04) whereas for the RW group, it was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.28 - 1.54). For the validation cohort, which comprised of patients from the Critical carE Database for Advanced Research, estimates for 28-day mortality for the RW and RI groups were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.05 - 1.46) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.14 - 1.59), respectively. For secondary outcomes, the RW group had a shorter time to ICU discharge and time to cessation of mechanical ventilation with corticosteroid treatment, where the RI group again demonstrated harm. The findings support matching treatment strategies to empirically observed pathobiology and offer a more nuanced understanding of corticosteroid utility. Our results have implications for the design and interpretation of both observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), suggesting the need for stratification methods that account for the differential response to standard of care.","Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine Program, Cornell University,  NY, USA.; Division of Health Informatics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Health Informatics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Health Informatics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, New  York-Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; First Department of Critical Care Medicine and Pulmonary Services, Evangelismos  Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, New  York-Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics.

37994187,"BACKGROUND: To assess the association of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC) with the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) versus long-acting insulins (LAIs), which are the two commonly prescribed injectable glucose-lowering agents (GLAs) for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) after the failure of multiple oral GLAs. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using the nationwide data of a Taiwanese cohort with T2D. Incident new users of GLP-1RAs and LAIs during 2013-2018 were identified, and propensity score (PS) matching was applied to ensure between-group comparability in baseline patient characteristics. The primary outcome was the composite liver disease including cirrhosis or HCC. Each patient was followed until the occurrence of a study outcome, death, or the end of 2019, whichever came first. Subdistribution hazard models were employed to assess the treatment-outcome association. Sensitivity (e.g., stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis, time-dependent analysis), E-value, and negative control outcome analyses were performed to examine the robustness of study findings. RESULTS: We included 7171 PS-matched pairs of GLP-1RA and LAI users with no significant between-group differences at baseline. Compared with LAIs, the use of GLP-1RAs was associated with significantly reduced risks of composite liver disease (subdistribution hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.56 [0.42-0.76]), cirrhosis (0.59 [0.43-0.81]), and HCC (0.47 [0.24-0.93]). Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses and among patients with different baseline characteristics. CONCLUSION: Among T2D patients who require injectable GLAs, the use of GLP-1RAs versus LAIs was associated with lower risks of cirrhosis and HCC.","Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University,  Tainan, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine,  National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal  Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.",10.1111/joim.13751 [doi],Yang CT; Yao WY; Yang CY; Peng ZY; Ou HT; Kuo S,ORCID: 0000-0002-5747-6806; ORCID: 0000-0002-5475-7848,© 2023 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.,,,,,2023/11/23 03:57,20240214,20231122,2024 Mar,2023/11/23 06:42,,,"Yang, Chun-Ting; Yao, Wen-Yu; Yang, Chen-Yi; Peng, Zi-Yang; Ou, Huang-Tz; Kuo, Shihchen",,109-2320-B-006-047-MY3/the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology/,3,,1365-2796,0954-6820,,8904841,Journal of internal medicine,eng,10.1111/joim.13751 [doi],20241010,"Humans; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/drug therapy; Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use; *Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/epidemiology; Cohort Studies; *Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology; Liver Cirrhosis/drug therapy",2024/02/14 12:42,,,,GLP-1 receptor agonists; hepatocellular carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; long-acting insulins; type 2 diabetes,NOTNLM,NLM,357-368,,2023/11/23 03:57,2024/02/14 12:42,,,2023/11/23 06:42,,England,,,ppublish,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",0 (Hypoglycemic Agents),IM,,J Intern Med. 2024 Mar;295(3):357-368. doi: 10.1111/joim.13751.

37713434,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the tolerability and effectiveness of two different  classes of biological DMARDs [IL-17 and IL-23(p19) inhibitors, IL-17i and IL-23(p19)i] relative to TNF inhibitors (TNFi) regarding the drug survival rates and treatment outcomes in patients with PsA. METHODS: We emulated a target trial on comparative effectiveness using observational data from a prospective cohort study based on the Parker Institute's PsA cohort (the PIPA cohort). All patients underwent interview and a clinical examination programme at baseline and at follow-up visits at 4 and 12 months. The primary endpoint, drug survival, was assessed up to 12 months from baseline. We estimated hazard ratios from proportional hazards model and used propensity score adjustment in an attempt to deconfound and emulate a random treatment assignment. RESULTS: We included a total of 109 patients in the intention-to-monitor population at baseline initiating either TNFi (75 patients), IL-17i (26 patients) or IL-23(19)i (8 patients). Hazard ratios in the propensity adjusted model comparing IL-17i and IL-23(p19)i with TNFi were 1.36 (95% CI 0.59-3.14) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.10-3.24), respectively. TNFi and IL-17i had comparable effects regarding response rates and changes in clinical outcomes after 12 months, whereas IL-23(p19)i tended to perform better overall. CONCLUSION: No decisive differences between drugs were observed at group level regarding drug survival and clinical outcomes after 12 months. TNFi, IL-17i and IL-23(p19)i may all be considered equally effective in the treatment of patients with PsA, advocating for investigating more in personalized treatment strategies.","The Parker Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, University of  Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; The Parker Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, University of  Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Research Unit of Rheumatology, Department of Clinical Research, University of  Southern Denmark, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.; The Parker Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, University of  Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Dermatology, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen,  Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; The Parker Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, University of  Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Center of Rheumatic Research Aalborg (CERRA), Department of Rheumatology, Aalborg  University Hospital, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Stichting Tools Patient Research Partner, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; The Parker Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, University of  Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Research Unit of Rheumatology, Department of Clinical Research, University of  Southern Denmark, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.; The Parker Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, University of  Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",7274873 [pii]; 10.1093/rheumatology/kead488 [doi],Stisen ZR; Nielsen SM; Skougaard M; Mogensen M; Jørgensen TS; Dreyer L; de Wit M; Christensen R; Kristensen LE,ORCID: 0000-0003-2676-4749; ORCID: 0000-0002-0686-7102,"© The Author(s) 2023.

33493012,"BACKGROUND: Hypercoagulability may be a key mechanism of death in patients with  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and examine the observational effect of early therapeutic anticoagulation on survival. DESIGN: In a multicenter cohort study of 3239 critically ill adults with COVID-19, the incidence of VTE and major bleeding within 14 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission was evaluated. A target trial emulation in which patients were categorized according to receipt or no receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation in the first 2 days of ICU admission was done to examine the observational effect of early therapeutic anticoagulation on survival. A Cox model with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding was used. SETTING: 67 hospitals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with COVID-19 admitted to a participating ICU. MEASUREMENTS: Time to death, censored at hospital discharge, or date of last follow-up. RESULTS: Among the 3239 patients included, the median age was 61 years (interquartile range, 53 to 71 years), and 2088 (64.5%) were men. A total of 204 patients (6.3%) developed VTE, and 90 patients (2.8%) developed a major bleeding event. Independent predictors of VTE were male sex and higher D-dimer level on ICU admission. Among the 2809 patients included in the target trial emulation, 384 (11.9%) received early therapeutic anticoagulation. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 days, patients who received early therapeutic anticoagulation had a similar risk for death as those who did not (hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.35]). LIMITATION: Observational design. CONCLUSION: Among critically ill adults with COVID-19, early therapeutic anticoagulation did not affect survival in the target trial emulation.

39445596,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that semaglutide, a  glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. However, real-world evidence for its ability to protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) is lacking. METHODS: We conducted emulation target trials based on a nationwide database of electronic health records (EHRs) of 116 million US patients. Seven target trials were emulated among 1,094,761 eligible patients with T2DM who had no prior AD diagnosis by comparing semaglutide with seven other antidiabetic medications. First-ever diagnosis of AD occurred within a 3-year follow-up period and was examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: Semaglutide was associated with significantly reduced risk for first-time AD diagnosis, most strongly compared with insulin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33 [95% CI: 0.21 to 0.51]) and most weakly compared with other GLP-1RAs (HR, 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37 to 0.95]). Similar results were seen across obesity status, gender, and age groups. DISCUSSION: These findings support further studies to assess semaglutide's potential in preventing AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Semaglutide was associated with 40% to 70% reduced risks of first-time AD diagnosis in T2DM patients compared to other antidiabetic medications, including other GLP-1RAs. Semaglutide was associated with significantly lower AD-related medication prescriptions. Similar reductions were seen across obesity status, gender, and age groups. Our findings provide real-world evidence supporting the potential clinical benefits of semaglutide in mitigating AD initiation and development in patients with T2DM. These findings support further clinical trials to assess semaglutide's potential in delaying or preventing AD.","Center for Science, Health, and Society, Case Western Reserve University School  of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University School  of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Department of Neuroscience, Development and Regenerative Biology, College of  Sciences, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.; National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Maryland, USA.; Center for Community Health Integration, Case Western Reserve University School  of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Center for Clinical Informatics Research and Education, The MetroHealth System,  Ohio, USA.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.",ALZ14313 [pii]; 10.1002/alz.14313 [doi],Wang W; Wang Q; Qi X; Gurney M; Perry G; Volkow ND; Davis PB; Kaelber DC; Xu R,,© 2024 The Author(s).

39186265,"IMPORTANCE: One-third of older adults in the US have depression, often treated  with psychotherapy and antidepressants. Previous studies suggesting an increased risk of falls and related injuries (FRI) associated with antidepressant use may be affected by confounding by indication or immortal time bias. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between FRI risk and first-line treatments in older adults with depression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used a target trial emulation framework with a cloning-censoring-weighting approach with Medicare claims data from 2016 to 2019. Participants included fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed depression. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. EXPOSURES: First-line depression treatments including psychotherapy, sertraline, escitalopram, citalopram, mirtazapine, duloxetine, trazodone, fluoxetine, bupropion, paroxetine, and venlafaxine. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: One-year FRI rate, restricted mean survival time (RMST), and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% CI. RESULTS: Among 101 953 eligible beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 76 [8] years), 63 344 (62.1%) were female, 7404 (7.3%) were Black individuals, and 81 856 (80.3%) were White individuals. Compared with the untreated group, psychotherapy use was not associated with FRI risk (aHR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.82-1.17]), while other first-line antidepressants were associated with a decreased FRI risk (aHR ranged from 0.74 [95% CI, 0.59-0.89] for bupropion to 0.83 [95% CI, 0.67-0.98] for escitalopram). The FRI incidence ranged from 63 (95% CI, 53-75) per 1000 person-year for those treated with bupropion to 87 (95% CI, 83-90) per 1000 person-year for those who were untreated. The RMST ranged from 349 (95% CI, 346-350) days for those who were untreated to 353 (95% CI, 350-356) days for those treated with bupropion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of older Medicare beneficiaries with depression, first-line antidepressants were associated with a decreased FRI risk compared with untreated individuals. These findings provide valuable insights into their safety profiles, aiding clinicians in their consideration for treating depression in older adults.","Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University  of Florida, Gainesville.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University  of Florida, Gainesville.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University  of Florida, Gainesville.; North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System Geriatric Research Education  and Clinical Center, Gainesville, Florida.; College of Public Health and Health Professions and College of Medicine,  University of Florida, Gainesville.; North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System Geriatric Research Education  and Clinical Center, Gainesville, Florida.; Division of General Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.; Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing, Health Policy Institute,  University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",2822799 [pii]; zoi241058 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.35535 [doi],Wang GH; Lai EC; Goodin AJ; Reise RC; Shorr RI; Lo-Ciganic WH,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Shorr reported providing expert testimony on  falls that occur in the hospital outside the submitted work.

38992341,"Postmenopausal women experience significant changes in body composition,  particularly abdominal adipose tissue (AAT) deposition patterns, which influence cardiometabolic risk. Physical activity has demonstrable effects on body composition and overall health; however, there is little evidence for how physical activity influences AAT patterns and body composition in postmenopausal women. We emulated a target trial of physical activity interventions, including the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommendations (≥150 minutes/week), on 3-year changes in AAT and body composition. We analyzed data from 4451 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) with repeated whole body Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans with derived abdominal visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). The mean AAT and body composition measures were estimated with the parametric-g formula. Over 3 years, interventions of increasing minutes of moderate activity would result in dose-dependent reductions in AAT, overall body fat and increases in lean soft tissue, with the greatest estimated benefit at the 2018 physical activity guideline recommendations. Compared to no intervention, if all participants had adhered to ≥150 mins/week of moderate physical activity, they would have 16.8 cm2 lower VAT (95% CI: -23.1, -10.4), 26.8 cm2 lower SAT (95% CI: -36.3, -17.3), 1.3% lower total body fat (95% CI: -1.8, -0.7), 1.2% higher total lean soft tissue (95% CI: 0.7-1.8), and 2.6 kg lower bodyweight (95% CI, -3.6, -1.5). We saw similar patterns in vigorous-intensity activity interventions. These results suggest that postmenopausal women who adhere to physical activity guideline recommendations would experience beneficial body composition changes over 3 years.","Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA,  United States.; Department of Health Promotion Sciences, University of Arizona Cancer Center,  Tucson, AZ, United States.; Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, Social and Preventive  Medicine, University of Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, United States.; Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA,  United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.; Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California, Davis, CA, United  States.; Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Professor of  Medicine and the Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women's Health, Harvard Medical School Boston, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard University, MA, United States.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States.; Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA,  United States.",7712313 [pii]; 10.1093/aje/kwae190 [doi],Li J; Bea JW; LaMonte M; Jiang L; Reding K; Garcia L; Manson JAE; Follis S; Odegaard AO,ORCID: 0000-0002-2309-1959; ORCID: 0000-0002-9868-1574; ORCID: 0000-0002-6669-5242; ORCID: 0000-0002-2281-7260; ORCID: 0000-0001-5179-8559; ORCID: 0000-0002-9976-761X; ORCID: 0000-0002-5617-3619; ORCID: 0000-0002-8357-8398,"© The Author(s) 2024.

38777141,"AIM: Preclinical studies have shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2  inhibitors (SGLT2is) have a neuroprotective effect. This study compared the risks of carpal tunnel syndrome and carpal tunnel release surgery between new users of SGLT2is and new users of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). METHODS: A retrospective new-user active comparator cohort study with a target trial design was conducted by using the TriNetX platform. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus prescribed SGLT2is or GLP-1RAs were identified. Covariates were balanced using propensity score matching to form 2 homogenous treatment groups. Outcomes were the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome and the risk of carpal tunnel release surgery. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the TriNetX platform. RESULTS: The crude cohort included 86,188 and 100,244 patients in the SGLT2is group and GLP-1RAs group, respectively. After matching, each group included 65,464 patients. The SGLT2is group had an average age of 59.6 years, and 46 % were women. The GLP-1RAs group had an average age of 59.5 years, and 45.9 % were women. The incidences of carpal tunnel syndrome (HR: 0.928; 95 % CI: 0.869 to 0.991) and carpal tunnel release surgery (HR: 0.840; 95 % CI: 0.726 to 0.971) were significantly lower in the SGLT2is group than in the GLP-1RAs group. CONCLUSION: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, SGLT2is seem to decrease the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome and the need for carpal tunnel release surgery. Prospective studies are required to confirm our results.","Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Cheng Kung  University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Cheng Kung  University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical  University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Cheng Kung  University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

33153631,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury (AKI)  when spironolactone use is added on to loop diuretic use among patients with heart failure, and to evaluate whether the risk is modified by level of kidney function. METHODS: We identified 17,110 patients with heart failure treated with loop diuretics between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2016 within the Geisinger Health System. We estimated the incidence of hyperkalemia and AKI associated with spironolactone initiation, and used target trial emulation methods to minimize confounding by indication. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 134 mo, 3229 of 17,110 patients (18.9%) initiated spironolactone. Incidence rates of hyperkalemia and AKI in patients using spironolactone with a loop diuretic were 2.9 and 10.1 events per 1000 person-months, respectively. In propensity score-matched analyses, spironolactone initiation was associated with higher hyperkalemia and AKI risk compared with loop alone (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.10; P<.001, and hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.26; P=.04, respectively). There were no differences in the relative risk of either outcome associated with spironolactone by level of kidney function. CONCLUSION: The addition of spironolactone to loop diuretics in patients with heart failure was associated with higher risk of hyperkalemia and AKI; these risks must be weighed against the potential benefits of spironolactone.","Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins  University, Baltimore, MD; Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.

40043224,"PURPOSE: Young age is associated with increased risk of recurrence in hormone  receptor (HR)-positive early-stage breast cancer (eBC). Lack of adherence to endocrine therapy (ET) is a potential reason for the lower survival proportions observed in younger patients, but the survival benefits of improving adherence to ET in young patients remain unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the French National Health Data System and target trial emulation methods, we considered three sustained ET persistence strategies (allowing treatment gaps of no more than 30, 90, or 180 continuous days) and estimated the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) benefit of sustained ET persistence compared with observed ET persistence. RESULTS: A total of 121,601 patients with HR-positive eBC were included in the analyses, of whom 29.8% was younger than 50 years at diagnosis. Younger patients had lower DFS and were more likely to discontinue ET than older patients. In patients 34 years and younger, strict ET persistence (≤30-day gaps) improved 5-year DFS proportions from 74.5% to 78.8% (4.3 percentage points [95% CI, 2.6 to 7.2]) compared with observed persistence. ET persistence strategies allowing for ≤90-day and ≤180-day gaps reduced the 5-year DFS benefit in patients 34 years and younger to 1.3 (95% CI, 0.2 to 3.7) and 1.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to 3.4) percentage points, respectively. By contrast, DFS benefits of improved ET persistence in patients after 50 years old did not exceed 1.9 percentage points, compared with observed persistence, regardless of the persistence definition. CONCLUSION: The survival benefit that could be achieved with strict ET persistence in women 34 years and younger with HR-positive eBC highlights the need for tailored strategies to improve ET persistence in this population.","Institute of Mathematics, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne,  Switzerland.; Residual Tumor & Response to Treatment Laboratory, RT2Lab, Translational Research  Department, INSERM, U932 Immunity and Cancer, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Residual Tumor & Response to Treatment Laboratory, RT2Lab, Translational Research  Department, INSERM, U932 Immunity and Cancer, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Gynecology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; Residual Tumor & Response to Treatment Laboratory, RT2Lab, Translational Research  Department, INSERM, U932 Immunity and Cancer, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Medical Oncology, Université Paris Cité, Institut Curie, Paris,  France.; Residual Tumor & Response to Treatment Laboratory, RT2Lab, Translational Research  Department, INSERM, U932 Immunity and Cancer, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Medical Oncology, Université Paris Cité, Institut Curie, Paris,  France.; Centre René Hughenin, Medical Oncology Department, Saint Cloud, France.; Health Data and Assessment, Health Survey Data Science and Assessment Division,  French National Cancer Institute (Institut National du Cancer INCa), Boulogne-Billancourt, France.; Health Data and Assessment, Health Survey Data Science and Assessment Division,  French National Cancer Institute (Institut National du Cancer INCa), Boulogne-Billancourt, France.; Residual Tumor & Response to Treatment Laboratory, RT2Lab, Translational Research  Department, INSERM, U932 Immunity and Cancer, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Surgical Oncology, Université Paris Cité, Institut Curie, Paris,  France.; Department of Surgery, Institut Jean Godinot, Reims, France.; Residual Tumor & Response to Treatment Laboratory, RT2Lab, Translational Research  Department, INSERM, U932 Immunity and Cancer, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Institute of Mathematics, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne,  Switzerland.",10.1200/JCO.24.01131 [doi],Dumas E; Jochum F; Coussy F; Hamy AS; Majdling A; Houzard S; Le Bihan-Benjamin C; Reyal F; Gougis P; Stensrud MJ,ORCID: 0000-0002-7877-719X; ORCID: 0000-0001-5009-3936; ORCID: 0000-0003-4430-3022; ORCID: 0000-0002-1868-9358; ORCID: 0000-0002-2318-3589; ORCID: 0000-0001-9641-1936,,,,,,2025/03/05 16:03,20250528,20250305,2025 Jun,2025/03/05 18:20,,,"Dumas, Elise; Jochum, Floriane; Coussy, Florence; Hamy, Anne-Sophie; Majdling, Alena; Houzard, Sophie; Le Bihan-Benjamin, Christine; Reyal, Fabien; Gougis, Paul; Stensrud, Mats Julius",,,16,,1527-7755,0732-183X,,8309333,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of  Clinical Oncology,eng,10.1200/JCO.24.01131 [doi],20250528,"Humans; *Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/chemistry/metabolism; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; *Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use/administration & dosage; Age Factors; *Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Aged; France/epidemiology; Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism/analysis; Cohort Studies; Disease-Free Survival; Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism; Aged, 80 and over",2025/05/29 00:27,,,,,,NLM,1863-1874,,2025/03/05 16:03,2025/05/29 00:27,,,2025/03/05 18:20,,United States,,,ppublish,Journal Article,"0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal); 0 (Receptors, Estrogen); 0 (Receptors, Progesterone)",IM,,J Clin Oncol. 2025 Jun;43(16):1863-1874. doi: 10.1200/JCO.24.01131.

39992678,"IMPORTANCE: People living with HIV and atrial fibrillation (AF) often receive  anticoagulation that may interact with their antiretroviral therapy (ART). No studies exist comparing the safety of oral anticoagulants in this population. OBJECTIVE: To compare the bleeding risks among warfarin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban users in a national US cohort with AF and HIV. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A new-user, active-comparator, propensity score overlap-weighted cohort study using the target trial emulation framework including Medicare claims database data (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2020) was carried out. The analysis was conducted from July 2023 to April 2024. EXPOSURE: New initiators of warfarin vs apixaban, rivaroxaban vs apixaban, and rivaroxaban vs warfarin aged 50 years or older with nonvalvular AF and HIV. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was hospitalization for major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 2683 individuals (mean [SD] age, 66.22 [8.97] years; 580 female individuals [21.6%]) in the warfarin vs apixaban cohort, 2176 (mean [SD] age, 66.61 [8.87] years; 455 female individuals [20.9%]) in the rivaroxaban vs apixaban cohort, and 1787 (mean age, 65.47 years; 377 female individuals [21.1%]) in the rivaroxaban vs warfarin cohort. After propensity score overlap weighting, warfarin initiation was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding than initiation of apixaban (hazard ratio [HR], 2.60; 95% CI, 1.51-4.49), including major gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.52-5.90). This association was intensified in the 71% of patients taking concurrent ART (major bleeding, HR, 6.68; 95% CI, 2.78-16.02; gastrointestinal bleeding, HR, 5.28; 95% CI, 2.08-13.42). Rivaroxaban vs apixaban was also associated with a higher rate of major bleeding (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18-3.94) and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.57-7.25), with a stronger association in those using ART (major bleeding, HR, 4.83; 95% CI, 2.11-11.08; gastrointestinal bleeding, HR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.78-12.70). Estimates were similar when comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin. No significant difference was observed in the rate of ischemic stroke or mortality among the 3 oral anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that in patients with HIV and AF, especially those treated with ART, warfarin and rivaroxaban were associated with higher rates of major bleeding compared with apixaban, suggesting a superior safety profile for apixaban in this high-risk population.","Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts  General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts  General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston.",2830181 [pii]; ioi240098 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.8335 [doi],Quinlan CM; Avorn J; Kesselheim AS; Singer DE; Zhang Y; Cervone A; Lin KJ,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Singer reported grants from the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) during the conduct of the study; grants from Bristol Myers Squibb, consulting and advisory board fees from Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, and personal fees from UpToDate outside the submitted work.

38864813,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of newly diagnosed  retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i). METHODS: Claims data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used in this nationwide retrospective cohort study. A target trial emulation framework was applied. Patients with T2D with no prior diagnosis of RVO who had newly commenced treatment with SGLT-2i or DPP-4i between May 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, were included. Potential systematic differences in baseline characteristics between the paired groups were controlled using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting. The outcome of interest was incident RVO. The hazard ratio (HR) for SGLT-2i compared with that of DPP-4i was estimated using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Data from 123,567 and 578,665 patients receiving SGLT-2i and DPP-4i, respectively, were analyzed. The incidence of RVO was lower in patients newly receiving SGLT-2i (0.59 events per 1000 person-years) compared to those receiving DPP-4i (0.77 events per 1000 person-years) over a mean follow-up of 1.61 years. SGLT-2i users had a significantly lower risk of developing RVO compared with DPP-4i users (HR = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-0.98). In the individual outcome analysis, SGLT-2i use was significantly associated with a lower risk of branch RVO (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.52-0.96), but not central RVO (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.57-1.24).

38667266,"BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Emergency Medicine Specialist (GEMS) pilot program is  an innovative approach that utilizes geriatric-trained advanced practice providers to facilitate geriatric assessments and care planning for older adults in the emergency department (ED). The objective of this study was to explore the effect of GEMS on the use of observation status and final ED disposition. METHODS: This was a retrospective study under a target trial emulation framework. Geriatric patients (65+ years old) who presented to two ED sites within a large regional healthcare system between December 2020 and December 2022 were included. The primary outcome was final ED disposition (discharge, hospital inpatient admission, or hospital observation admission). Secondary outcomes included ED observation and ED length of stay. Non-GEMS patients were propensity score matched 5:1 to GEMS patients. Doubly robust regression was used to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of inpatient admission, discharge, hospital observation admission, ED observation admission, and estimate the mean ED length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 427 of 43,064 total patients (1.0%) received a GEMS intervention during the study period. Our analysis included 2,302 geriatric ED patients (410 GEMS, 1,892 non-GEMS) after propensity score matching. Hospital admission rates were 34.1% for GEMS compared to 56.4% for conventional treatment. GEMS patients had decreased odds of inpatient admission (OR: 0.41, 95 CI: 0.34-0.51, p < 0.001), increased odds of discharge (OR: 1.19 95 CI: 1.00-1.42, p = 0.047), hospital observation admission (OR: 2.97, 95 CI: 2.35-3.75, p < 0.001), ED observation admission (OR: 4.84 95 CI: 3.67-6.38, p < 0.001), and had a longer average ED length of stay (170 min, 95 CI: 84.6-256, p < 0.001) compared to non-GEMS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients seen by GEMS during their ED visit were associated with higher rates of hospital discharge and lower rates of hospital admissions.","Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Section for Biomedical Informatics and Data Science, Yale University School of  Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Care, Department of Internal Medicine, NYU  Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, Yale School of Medicine, New  Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, Yale School of Medicine, New  Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, James J.

34242775,"PURPOSE: To examine National Cancer Database (NCDB) data to comparatively  evaluate overall survival (OS) between patients undergoing transarterial radioembolization (TARE) and those undergoing systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma with major vascular invasion (HCC-MVI). METHODS: One thousand five hundred fourteen patients with HCC-MVI undergoing first-line TARE or systemic therapy were identified from the NCDB. OS was compared using propensity score-matched Cox regression and landmark analysis. Efficacy was also compared within a target trial framework. RESULTS: TARE usage doubled between 2010 and 2015. Intervals before treatment were longer for TARE than for systemic therapy (mean [median], 66.5 [60] days vs 46.8 (35) days, respectively, P < .0001). In propensity-score-matched and landmark-time-adjusted analyses, TARE was found to be associated with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95 % CI, 0.60-0.91; P = .005) and median OS of 7.1 months (95 % CI, 5.0-10.5) versus 4.9 months (95 % CI, 3.9-6.5) for systemically treated patients. In an emulated target trial involving 236 patients with unilobular HCC-MVI, a low number of comorbidities, creatinine levels <2.0 mg/dL, bilirubin levels <2.0 mg/dL, and international normalized ratio <1.7, TARE was found to be associated with a hazard ratio of 0.57 (95 % CI, 0.39-0.83; P = .004) and a median OS of 12.9 months (95 % CI, 7.6-19.2) versus 6.5 months (95 % CI, 3.6-11.1) for the systemic therapy arm. CONCLUSIONS: In propensity-score-matched analyses involving pragmatic and target trial HCC-MVI cohorts, TARE was found to be associated with significant survival benefits compared with systemic therapy. Although not a substitute for prospective trials, these findings suggest that the increasing use of TARE for HCC-MVI is accompanied by improved OS. Further trials of TARE in patients with HCC-MVI are needed, especially to compare with newer systemic therapies.","Queen's Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii; Clinical and Translational Science  Section, Cancer Biology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii.

38343863,"BACKGROUND: Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection  (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes.","RTI International, Durham, NC, USA.; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.;

37589143,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: There has been growing interest in better understanding the  potential of observational research methods in medical product evaluation and regulatory decision-making. Previously, we used linked claims and electronic health record data to emulate two ongoing randomized controlled trials, characterizing the populations and results of each randomized controlled trial prior to publication of its results. Here, our objective was to compare the populations and results from the emulated trials with those of the now-published randomized controlled trials. METHODS: This study compared participants' demographic and clinical characteristics and study results between the emulated trials, which used structured data from OptumLabs Data Warehouse, and the published PRONOUNCE and GRADE trials. First, we examined the feasibility of implementing the baseline participant characteristics included in the published PRONOUNCE and GRADE trials' using real-world data and classified each variable as ascertainable, partially ascertainable, or not ascertainable. Second, we compared the emulated trials and published randomized controlled trials for baseline patient characteristics (concordance determined using standardized mean differences <0.20) and results of the primary and secondary endpoints (concordance determined by direction of effect estimates and statistical significance). RESULTS: The PRONOUNCE trial enrolled 544 participants, and the emulated trial included 2226 propensity score-matched participants. In the PRONOUNCE trial publication, one of the 32 baseline participant characteristics was listed as an exclusion criterion on ClinicalTrials.gov but was ultimately not used. Among the remaining 31 characteristics, 9 (29.0%) were ascertainable, 11 (35.5%) were partially ascertainable, and 10 (32.2%) were not ascertainable using structured data from OptumLabs. For one additional variable, the PRONOUNCE trial did not provide sufficient detail to allow its ascertainment. Of the nine variables that were ascertainable, values in the emulated trial and published randomized controlled trial were discordant for 6 (66.7%). The primary endpoint of time from randomization to the first major adverse cardiovascular event and secondary endpoints of nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke were concordant between the emulated trial and published randomized controlled trial. The GRADE trial enrolled 5047 participants, and the emulated trial included 7540 participants. In the GRADE trial publication, 8 of 34 (23.5%) baseline participant characteristics were ascertainable, 14 (41.2%) were partially ascertainable, and 11 (32.4%) were not ascertainable using structured data from OptumLabs. For one variable, the GRADE trial did not provide sufficient detail to allow for ascertainment. Of the eight variables that were ascertainable, values in the emulated trial and published randomized controlled trial were discordant for 4 (50.0%). The primary endpoint of time to hemoglobin A1c ≥7.0% was mostly concordant between the emulated trial and the published randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION: Despite challenges, observational methods and real-world data can be leveraged in certain important situations for a more timely evaluation of drug effectiveness and safety in more diverse and representative patient populations.","Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University,  Atlanta, GA, USA.; Robert D. and Patricia E.

40465280,"IMPORTANCE: It is unclear whether concomitant methotrexate enhances the  effectiveness and persistence of adalimumab for psoriasis. The recent OPTIMAP randomized clinical trial that tested adalimumab against adalimumab with methotrexate could not adequately answer this question due to underrecruitment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of using methotrexate with adalimumab in people with plaque psoriasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This target trial emulation cohort study replicated key aspects of the OPTIMAP trial design using the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register between 2007 and 2021. EXPOSURES: Adalimumab, 40 mg, every other week monotherapy (comparator) vs adalimumab, 40 mg, every other week and methotrexate weekly, with the dosage as determined by the clinician (intervention). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference in the adalimumab survival function at 1 year. The secondary outcomes included differences in adalimumab survival function at 3 years; 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) at 1 year and 3 years; serious adverse events at 1 and 3 years; and adalimumab concentrations and antidrug antibodies at 1 year. Inverse probability treatment and censoring weighting were used for covariate and missing outcome adjustment. Flexible parametric survival models were fitted for survival outcomes and generalized linear models for other outcomes. RESULTS: There were 231 and 1553 participants (754 female individuals [42.3%]) in the intervention (median [IQR] age, 43.7 [35.1-53.1] years) and comparator (median [IQR] age, 43.6 [34.2-52.0] years) arms, respectively. Drug survival for the comparator arm at 1 year was 78.1% (95% CI, 76.1%-80.2%) and the intervention arm was 79.1% (95% CI, 71.8%-87.2%), with no evidence of difference (1.0%; 95% CI, -7.0% to 8.9%). PASI75 at 1 year and 3 years in the comparator arm was 52.0% (95% CI, 47.7%-56.3%) and 32.4% (95% CI, 28.0%-36.8%), respectively; in the intervention arm, PASI75 was 49.4% (95% CI, 31.5%-67.3%) and 37.2% (95% CI, 16.8%-57.6%), respectively. There was no evidence of differences at 1 year and 3 years (-2.5%; 95% CI, -21.0% to 15.9% and 4.9%; 95% CI, -16.1% to 25.7%, respectively). There was no evidence for a difference between the 2 arms for serious adverse events and adalimumab concentrations, while the intervention arm had a lower antidrug antibody level (risk difference, -123.7 AU/mL; 95% CI, -200.5 to -46.9). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that there was no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness and persistence of adalimumab in people with psoriasis between monotherapy and adalimumab with concomitant methotrexate.","Centre for Dermatology Research, Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological  Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; The Dermatology Centre, Salford Royal Hospital, Northern Care Alliance NHS  Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.; St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences,  Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Leeds Dermatology Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Chapeltown Road,  Leeds, United Kingdom.; Institute of Translational and Clinical Medicine, Medical School, Newcastle  University, Department of Dermatology, Royal Victoria Infirmary and National Institute for Health and Care Research Newcastle Biomedical Research Centre, Newcastle Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.; Centre for Dermatology Research, Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological  Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences,  Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London, London,  United Kingdom.; Centre for Dermatology Research, Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological  Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; The Dermatology Centre, Salford Royal Hospital, Northern Care Alliance NHS  Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.",2834649 [pii]; doi250019 [pii]; 10.1001/jamadermatol.2025.1463 [doi],Yiu ZZN; Smith CH; Laws P; Hampton PJ; Griffiths CEM; Warren RB,,,,BADBIR Study Group; BSTOP Study Group,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Smith reported grants from MRC during the  conduct of the study as well as grants from the European Commission outside the submitted work.

39396526,"BACKGROUND: Adjunctive clindamycin use is associated with survival in invasive  group A streptococcus (GAS) infections but increasing clindamycin resistance in GAS has called into question its durability for this indication. Linezolid also inhibits GAS toxin and virulence factor production, but clinical efficacy data remain sparse. METHODS: We retrospectively emulated a target multicentre, non-blinded, non-inferiority trial to assess the efficacy of adjunctive linezolid compared with clindamycin in adult inpatients with invasive GAS infection treated with a β-lactam using the PINC AI database between 2016 and 2021. Patients were eligible if they had a monomicrobial GAS culture and received adjunctive therapy within 3 days of culture either concurrently or after β-lactam initiation and completed at least 3 days of β-lactam therapy. The primary outcome was adjusted risk ratio (aRR) of in-hospital mortality assessed by overlap-weighting using propensity scores. Secondary outcomes were length of stay among survivors and Clostridium difficile infection. FINDINGS: Of 1095 β-lactam-treated patients with GAS, 829 (76%) received clindamycin and 266 (24%) received linezolid. In the overlap weighted cohort, the receipt of linezolid was not associated with a statistically significant different aRR of in-hospital mortality compared with clindamycin (linezolid: 9·8% [26/266] vs clindamycin: 7·0% [58/829]; aRR: 0·92 [95% CI 0·42 to 1·43]; p=0·76). The risk difference was -0·005 (95% CI -0·05 to 0·04; p=0·81) and fell within the non-inferiority margin of 0·05. The primary analysis results were consistent across important subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Among survivors, median length of stay (adjusted ratio 0·96 [95% CI 0·16 to 0·08]; p=0·47) and C difficile infection risk (aRR 1·76 [95% CI 0·37 to 1·75]; p=0·29) were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: In this emulated trial of adult patients with invasive GAS infections treated with β-lactam, linezolid appeared non-inferior to clindamycin suggesting linezolid as an alternative for adjunctive antitoxin therapy.

39267410,"AIMS: Results from randomized trials suggest benefit of sodium-glucose  cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor initiation in clinically stable acute heart failure. We aim to examine the real-world effectiveness of early versus delayed post-discharge SGLT2 inhibitor initiation in people with acute heart failure and type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using linkable administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, individuals aged 66 years or older with type 2 diabetes who were discharged to the community from acute care hospitals for heart failure between 1 July 2016 and 31 March 2020 were included in this retrospective, population-based cohort study. The primary outcome was hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or cardiovascular mortality as a composite. Follow-up started from discharge for maximum 1 year. We compared outcomes between post-discharge SGLT2 inhibitor initiation within 3 days, 4-90 days, or 91-180 days, versus delayed initiation for at least 180 days. The 'clone-censor-weight' approach with a target trial emulation framework was used to address time-related biases. There were 9641 eligible individuals. After cloning and artificial censoring, there were 38 564 clones, 12 439 person-years, and 7584 events. Compared to delayed initiation for at least 180 days, initiation within 3 days post-discharge was associated with a lower 1-year risk of HHF or cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-0.83), while initiation 4-90 days (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.93) or 91-180 days (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-0.97) showed smaller risk reduction. CONCLUSION: Real-world evidence supports early SGLT2 inhibitor initiation to reduce HHF or cardiovascular mortality in acute heart failure and type 2 diabetes.","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON,  Canada.; Dr. Sandra Black Centre for Brain Resilience and Recovery, Hurvitz Brain Sciences  Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences  Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Division of Cardiology, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University,  Montreal, QC, Canada.; DREAM-CV Lab, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC,  Canada.; ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada.; University of Ottawa Heart Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada.; University of Ottawa Heart Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON,  Canada.; ICES uOttawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON,  Canada.; Dr. Sandra Black Centre for Brain Resilience and Recovery, Hurvitz Brain Sciences  Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.; KITE University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, ON,  Canada.",EJHF3464 [pii]; 10.1002/ejhf.3464 [doi],Wu CY; Shah BR; Sharma A; Sheng Y; Liu PP; Kopp A; Saskin R; Edwards JD; Swardfager W,ORCID: 0000-0002-0030-8908,© 2024 The Author(s).

38861869,"BACKGROUND: Bivalent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were developed to counter increasing  susceptibility to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We evaluated the durability of immunity and protection following first bivalent vaccination among nursing home residents. METHODS: We evaluated anti-spike and neutralization titers from blood in 653 community nursing home residents before and after each monovalent booster, and a bivalent vaccine. Concurrent clinical outcomes were evaluated using electronic health record data from a separate cohort of 3783 residents of Veterans Affairs (VA) nursing homes who had received at least the primary series monovalent vaccination. Using target trial emulation, we compared VA residents who did and did not receive the bivalent vaccine to measure vaccine effectiveness against infection, hospitalization, and death. FINDINGS: In the community cohort, Omicron BA.5 neutralization activity rose after each monovalent and bivalent booster vaccination regardless of prior infection history. Titers declined over time but six months post-bivalent vaccination, BA.5 neutralization persisted at detectable levels in 75% of infection-naive and 98% of prior-infected individuals. In the VA nursing home cohort, bivalent vaccine added effectiveness to monovalent booster vaccination by 18.5% for infection (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.6, 34.0%), and 29.2% for hospitalization or death (95% CI -14.2, 56.2%) over five months. INTERPRETATION: The level of protection declined after bivalent vaccination over a 6 month period and may open a window of added vulnerability before the next updated vaccine becomes available, suggesting a subset of nursing home residents may benefit from an additional vaccination booster.

38104114,"Reports of symptomatic rebound and/or test re-positivity among COVID-19 patients  following the standard five-day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have sparked debates regarding optimal treatment timing and dosage. It is unclear whether initiating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir immediately after symptom onset would improve clinical outcomes and/or lead to post-treatment viral burden rebound due to inadequate viral clearance during treatment. Here we show that, by emulating a randomized target trial using real-world electronic medical record data from all 87,070 adult users of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in Hong Kong between 16th March 2022 and 15th January 2023, early initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment (0 to 1 days after symptom onset or diagnosis) significantly reduced the incidence of 28-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization compared to delayed initiation (2 or more days) (absolute risk reduction [ARR]: 1.50% (95% confidence interval 1.17-1.80%); relative risk [RR]: 0.77 (0.73, 0.82)), but may be associated with a significant elevated risk of viral burden rebound (ARR: -1.08% (-1.55%, -0.46%)), although the latter estimates were associated with high uncertainty due to limited sample sizes. As such, patients should continue to initiate nirmatrelvir/ritonavir early after symptom onset or diagnosis to better protect against the more serious outcomes of hospitalization and mortality.","Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS  Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Vaccine Confidence Project, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London  School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; School of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; School of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University  of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Infectious Diseases Division, Department of Medicine, School of Clinical  Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for  Infection, Department of Microbiology, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; School of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China.; Centre for Immunology and Infection, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; School of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong SAR, China.  joewu@hku.hk.; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School  of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. joewu@hku.hk.; School of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China. joewu@hku.hk.; The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China. joewu@hku.hk.",10.1038/s41467-023-43706-0 [pii]; 43706 [pii]; 10.1038/s41467-023-43706-0 [doi],Wong CKH; Lau JJ; Au ICH; Lau KTK; Hung IFN; Peiris M; Leung GM; Wu JT,ORCID: 0000-0002-6895-6071; ORCID: 0000-0002-1556-2538; ORCID: 0000-0001-8217-5995; ORCID: 0000-0002-2503-6283; ORCID: 0000-0002-3155-5987,© 2023.

37755828,"IMPORTANCE: Observational (nonexperimental) studies that aim to emulate a  randomized trial (ie, the target trial) are increasingly informing medical and policy decision-making, but it is unclear how these studies are reported in the literature. Consistent reporting is essential for quality appraisal, evidence synthesis, and translation of evidence to policy and practice. OBJECTIVE: To assess the reporting of observational studies that explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for observational studies published between March 2012 and October 2022 that explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial of a health or medical intervention. Two reviewers double-screened and -extracted data on study characteristics, key predefined components of the target trial protocol and its emulation (eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, treatment assignment, outcome[s], follow-up, causal contrast[s], and analysis plan), and other items related to the target trial emulation. FINDINGS: A total of 200 studies that explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial were included. These studies included 26 subfields of medicine, and 168 (84%) were published from January 2020 to October 2022. The aim to emulate a target trial was explicit in 70 study titles (35%). Forty-three studies (22%) reported use of a published reporting guideline (eg, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology). Eighty-five studies (43%) did not describe all key items of how the target trial was emulated and 113 (57%) did not describe the protocol of the target trial and its emulation. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review of 200 studies that explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial, reporting of how the target trial was emulated was inconsistent. A reporting guideline for studies explicitly aiming to emulate a target trial may improve the reporting of the target trial protocols and other aspects of these emulation attempts.","School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney,  Australia.; Centre for Pain IMPACT, Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia.; School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney,  Australia.; Centre for Pain IMPACT, Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia.; School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney,  Australia.; Centre for Pain IMPACT, Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.; CAUSALab, Harvard T.H.

39869915,"BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) differ in  their effects on body weight and risk for reoperation. However, it is unclear whether long-term health expenditures differ by procedure type in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To compare health expenditures 3 years before and 5.5 years after bariatric surgery between patients with diabetes undergoing RYGB versus SG. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation principles. SETTING: Integrated health system. PATIENTS: Patients with diabetes undergoing RYGB (n = 3147) or SG (n = 3510) from 2012 to 2019. MEASUREMENTS: Total, inpatient, outpatient, and medication expenditures. RESULTS: Characteristics of patients undergoing RYGB and SG were well balanced after weighting; 73% were female, average body mass index was 43.8 kg/m(2), and average age was 50 years. Expenditures per 6-month period decreased by about 30% for both groups, from $4039.06 (95% CI, $3770.88 to $4326.31) 3 years before to $2441.13 (CI, $2151.07 to $2770.30) 5.5 years after RYGB and from $3918.37 (CI, $3658.75 to $4196.40) 3 years before to $2658.15 (CI, $2279.17 to $3100.16) 5.5 years after SG. Total expenditures after surgery did not differ between groups through 5.5 years (difference at 5.5 years, -$217.02 [CI, -$671.29 to $201.96]) except for the first 6 months, when expenditures were transiently higher in the RYGB group (difference, $564.32 [CI, $232.60 to $895.20]), driven by a higher inpatient admission rate. Otherwise, postsurgical outpatient and medication expenditures did not appear to differ between RYGB and SG. LIMITATION: Unobserved confounding. CONCLUSION: Overall expenditures decreased substantially in the postsurgical period, primarily due to reductions in pharmacy expenditures, with no differences between RYGB and SG except in the first 6 months after surgery.

39553416,"BACKGROUND: Prompt antibiotic administration for febrile neutropenia (FN) is  standard of care, and targets of time to antibiotics (TTA) <60 min are common. We sought to determine the effect of TTA ≥60 versus <60 min on adverse outcomes (intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death) in children with cancer and FN. Effect modification by a decision rule that predicts infection (AUS-rule) and bacteraemia were also investigated. METHODS: The prospective, multi-centre (n = 8), Australian PICNICC study dataset was analysed. To control for confounding, we used outcome regression adjusted for propensity score modelled as restricted cubic spline with two degrees of freedom. The propensity score was estimated from a logistic regression model for the exposure on the confounders, identified a priori (age, sex, severely unwell, disease, chemotherapy intensity and site). TTA was defined as time from from emergency triage to first antibiotic dose. FINDINGS: 1685 FN episodes in 976 patients were included. Median TTA was 53 min (IQR 37-77 min, 1542 (92%) <120 min). An adverse outcome occurred in 43 (2.6%) episodes (39 ICU; 5 deaths). The confounder-adjusted point estimate suggested a lower risk for adverse outcome associated with TTA ≥60 min (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.32-1.21), but the wide 95% CI precluded definitive judgement about strength and direction of the effect (unadjusted RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.26, 1.05). Similarly, although the point estimates were suggestive of a null association or reduced risk for adverse outcome associated with TTA ≥60 min for all comparisons across bacteraemia or AUS-rule strata, the 95% CIs were imprecise. INTERPRETATION: For children with FN, there was no definite evidence that TTA ≥60 min from hospital triage (but within 2 h), increased risk of adverse outcome or prolonged hospital admission. This study has important implications for FN TTA mandates, suggesting a more nuanced approach is required.

38889205,"KEY POINTS: Restarting renin-angiotensin system inhibitor after discontinuation  was associated with a lower risk of kidney outcomes and mortality but not related to hyperkalemia. Our findings support a proactive approach to restarting renin-angiotensin system inhibitor among patients with CKD. BACKGROUND: While renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) have been the mainstream treatment for patients with CKD, they are often discontinued because of adverse effects such as hyperkalemia and AKI. It is unknown whether restarting RASi after discontinuation improves clinical outcomes. METHODS: Using the Osaka Consortium for Kidney disease Research database, we performed a target trial emulation study including 6065 patients with an eGFR of 10–60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) who were followed up by nephrologists and discontinued RASi between 2005 and 2021. With a clone-censor-weight approach, we compared a treatment strategy for restarting RASi within a year after discontinuation with that for not restarting RASi. Patients were followed up for 5 years at maximum after RASi discontinuation. The primary outcome was a composite kidney outcome (initiation of KRT, a ≥50% decline in eGFR, or kidney failure [eGFR <5 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)]). Secondary outcomes were all-cause death and incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels ≥5.5 mEq/L). RESULTS: Among those who discontinued RASi (mean [SD] age 66 [15] years, 62% male, mean [SD] eGFR 40 [26] ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), 2262 (37%) restarted RASi within a year. Restarting RASi was associated with a lower hazard of the composite kidney outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.78 to 0.93]) and all-cause death (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.80) compared with not restarting RASi. The incidence of hyperkalemia did not differ significantly between the two strategies (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.27). CONCLUSIONS: Restarting RASi after discontinuation was associated with a lower risk of kidney outcomes and mortality but not related to the incidence of hyperkalemia.","Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, Osaka General Medical Center,  Osaka, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Toyonaka Municipal Hospital, Toyonaka, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Ikeda City Hospital, Ikeda, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Sakai City Medical Center, Sakai, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Health and Counseling Center, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.; Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita,  Japan.",00001751-202410000-00011 [pii]; JASN-2024-000014 [pii]; 10.1681/ASN.0000000000000425 [doi],Hattori K; Sakaguchi Y; Oka T; Asahina Y; Kawaoka T; Doi Y; Hashimoto N; Kusunoki Y; Yamamoto S; Yamato M; Yamamoto R; Matsui I; Mizui M; Kaimori JY; Isaka Y,ORCID: 0000-0002-7018-0049; ORCID: 0000-0002-0987-5423; ORCID: 0000-0002-9507-3506; ORCID: 0009-0009-0987-2941; ORCID: 0000-0002-5165-291; ORCID: 0000-0002-1221-1900; ORCID: 0000-0003-2466-3143; ORCID: 0000-0002-0001-6235; ORCID: 0000-0003-2610-9824; ORCID: 0000-0001-8378-6130; ORCID: 0000-0003-2543-8108; ORCID: 0000-0001-6892-3942; ORCID: 0000-0002-0820-7167,,doi: 10.1681/ASN.0000000000000470,,"Disclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online  version of the article at http://links.lww.com/JSN/E747.",,2024/06/18 13:53,20241001,20240618,2024 Oct 1,2024/06/18 18:42,,,"Hattori, Koki; Sakaguchi, Yusuke; Oka, Tatsufumi; Asahina, Yuta; Kawaoka, Takayuki; Doi, Yohei; Hashimoto, Nobuhiro; Kusunoki, Yasuo; Yamamoto, Satoko; Yamato, Masafumi; Yamamoto, Ryohei; Matsui, Isao; Mizui, Masayuki; Kaimori, Jun-Ya; Isaka, Yoshitaka",,,10,,1533-3450,1046-6673,1046-6673,9013836,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,eng,10.1681/ASN.0000000000000425 [doi],20250708,"Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists/therapeutic use; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/mortality; *Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; Treatment Outcome",2024/10/03 03:28,,,,,,NLM,1391-1401,2024/06/12 00:00,2024/06/18 13:53,2024/10/03 03:28,,2025/10/01 00:00,2024/06/18 18:42,2024/01/03 00:00,United States,PMC11452132,2025/10/01,ppublish,Journal Article,0 (Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists); 0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors),IM,,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2024 Oct 1;35(10):1391-1401. doi: 10.1681/ASN.0000000000000425.

38470385,"IMPORTANCE: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with  increased risks of adverse health outcomes including premature death, but it is unclear whether ADHD pharmacotherapy influences the mortality risk. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether initiation of ADHD pharmacotherapy was associated with reduced mortality risk in individuals with ADHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In an observational nationwide cohort study in Sweden applying the target trial emulation framework, we identified individuals aged 6 through 64 years with an incident diagnosis of ADHD from 2007 through 2018 and no ADHD medication dispensation prior to diagnosis. Follow-up started from ADHD diagnosis until death, emigration, 2 years after ADHD diagnosis, or December 31, 2020, whichever came first. EXPOSURES: ADHD medication initiation was defined as dispensing of medication within 3 months of diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed all-cause mortality within 2 years of ADHD diagnosis, as well as natural-cause (eg, physical conditions) and unnatural-cause mortality (eg, unintentional injuries, suicide, and accidental poisonings). RESULTS: Of 148 578 individuals with ADHD (61 356 females [41.3%]), 84 204 (56.7%) initiated ADHD medication. The median age at diagnosis was 17.4 years (IQR, 11.6-29.1 years). The 2-year mortality risk was lower in the initiation treatment strategy group (39.1 per 10 000 individuals) than in the noninitiation treatment strategy group (48.1 per 10 000 individuals), with a risk difference of -8.9 per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, -17.3 to -0.6). ADHD medication initiation was associated with significantly lower rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.88) and unnatural-cause mortality (2-year mortality risk, 25.9 per 10 000 individuals vs 33.3 per 10 000 individuals; risk difference, -7.4 per 10 000 individuals; 95% CI, -14.2 to -0.5; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), but not natural-cause mortality (2-year mortality risk, 13.1 per 10 000 individuals vs 14.7 per 10 000 individuals; risk difference, -1.6 per 10 000 individuals; 95% CI, -6.4 to 3.2; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among individuals diagnosed with ADHD, medication initiation was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality, particularly for death due to unnatural causes.","Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen,  Bergen, Norway.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Centre for Innovation in Mental Health-School of Psychology, Faculty of  Environmental and Life Sciences, and Clinical and Experimental Sciences (CNS and Psychiatry), Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.; New York University Child Study Center, Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU  Langone, New York.; Solent NHS Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.; Department of Precision and Regenerative Medicine and Ionian Area (DIMEPRE-J),  University of Studies of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; School of medical sciences, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.",2816084 [pii]; joi240013 [pii]; 10.1001/jama.2024.0851 [doi],Li L; Zhu N; Zhang L; Kuja-Halkola R; D'Onofrio BM; Brikell I; Lichtenstein P; Cortese S; Larsson H; Chang Z,,,JAMA. 2024 Mar 12;331(10):831-833. doi: 10.1001/jama.2024.1755.

35305813,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of 1 cycle of assisted  reproductive technology (ART) vs. 3 cycles of intrauterine insemination (IUI). DESIGN: Target trial emulation using observational data. SETTING: A healthcare claims database (2011-2015). PATIENT(S): The patients were 29,021 women aged 18-45 years with an infertility diagnosis and no history of IUI or ART within the past 12 months. INTERVENTION(S): One ART cycle immediately, with no more cycles of ART or IUI within the next 4 months; or 1 IUI cycle immediately, with 2 additional consecutive cycles of IUI within the next 4 months unless pregnancy occurred. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Live births, multiple births, congenital malformations, preterm births, small-for-gestational-age newborns, large-for-gestational-age newborns, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. RESULT(S): The probability of live birth was 27.3% for ART and 26.3% for IUI. The observational analogue of per-protocol risk difference (95% confidence interval) for ART compared with IUI was 1.0% (-0.1%, 2.2%) for live births, 4.3% (3.7%, 4.9%) for multiple births, 3.4% (2.8%, 4.0%) for preterm births, 1.5% (0.9%, 2.1%) for NICU admissions, and 0.6% (0.2%, 1.0%) for gestational diabetes. The risk differences for the other outcomes were <0.5%. The results of the 2 strategies were similar in women ≤40 years, but in women >40 years the probability of live birth was greater for ART (14.4%) than for IUI (7.4%). CONCLUSION(S): Compared with 3 cycles of IUI, 1 cycle of ART was estimated to have a similar probability of live birth but slightly higher risks of multiple gestations, preterm births, and NICU admissions.","CAUSALab, Harvard T.H.

We evaluated vaccine effectiveness against reinfection with Omicron BA.1/2, BA.4/5, XBB, and later subvariants among 5- to 17-year-olds using data from the RECOVER initiative, a national electronic health record database covering 37 U.S. pediatric institutions. We emulated target trials by age group and variant period, comparing previously infected participants between January 2022 and August 2023. During the BA.1/2 period, vaccination reduced the risk of reinfection, with effectiveness rates of 62% in children and 65% in adolescents. During the BA.4/5 period, protection effectiveness in children was 57%, whereas no statistically significant protection was observed in adolescents. During the XBB or later period, no significant protection was observed in either group. In summary, COVID-19 vaccination provided protection against reinfection during early and mid-Omicron periods in previously infected pediatric populations, but effectiveness declined for later variants.","Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of  Pennsylvania.; University of Pennsylvania.; University of Pennsylvania.; University of Pittsburgh.; University of Pennsylvania.; University of Pennsylvania.; University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.; University Medical Center New Orleans.; Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine.; Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, The University of Iowa.; Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development, Seattle Children's Research  Institute.; UT Southwestern Medical Center.; University of Utah.; The Ohio State University.; Ochsner Health.; Nicklaus Children's Hospital, Miami, FL.; Program for Maternal Health Equity, Center for Urban Bioethics, Department of  Population Health and Urban Bioethics, Center for Obesity Research and Education, College of Public Health, Lewis Katz S.; Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.; University of Florida.; University of California, San Francisco.; Albert Einstein College of Medicine.; University of Alabama at Birmingham.; Nationwide Children's Hospital.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Penn State Health Milton  S.

36193173,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus on the optimal serum valproic acid (VPA)  concentration for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder (BD). We aimed to investigate the association between serum VPA levels and risk of mood episode recurrence. METHODS: We enrolled patients with BD from multiple medical institutions in Taiwan between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2019. Patients were divided into three groups according to their serum VPA concentrations (< 50 μg/ml, 50-74 μg/ml, and 75-104 μg/ml). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) compared times to mood episode recurrence using the < 50 μg/ml group as reference. A systematic review found relevant articles published before February 2022 (PROSPERO: CRD42022309661), and corresponding results were compared. FINDINGS: This cohort included 896 patients for an intention-to-treat analysis. Compared with the < 50 μg/ml group, a non-significantly lower risk of mood episode recurrence was found in the 50-74 μg/ml (aHR, 95% CI: 0·86, 0·71-1·05) and 75-104 μg/ml (0·91, 0·71-1·18) groups. A per-protocol analysis of 481 patients found a significant risk reduction in the 50-74 μg/ml group (0·76, 0·60-0·97), with inconclusive results in the ≥ 75 μg/ml group (1·03, 0·73-1·46). A meta-analysis including two studies (254 patients) and our cohort found a similar significantly lower risk of mood episode recurrence in the 50-74 μg/ml group (HR, 95% CI: 0·83, 0·69-0·99), while risk reduction in the 75-99 μg/ml group (0·62, 0·26-1·48) did not differ significantly from that in the < 50 μg/ml group or the 50-74 μg/ml group. INTERPRETATION: The combined results of this cohort and previous studies suggest that VPA between 50-74 μg/ml may be a more effective concentration to prevent acute mood episodes during maintenance therapy in patients with BD compared with VPA < 50 μg/ml.

40075548,"The risk of psoriasis in diabetic patients has rarely been explored. This study  aims to compare the risk of incident psoriasis in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) who initiate dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) with those who initiate sulfonylureas, the most common second-line glucose-lowering therapy, in addition to metformin monotherapy. This sequential, propensity-score-matched, new-user comparative effectiveness study utilized a target trial emulation framework. It included adults with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy, using data from 2006 to 2015 from a general population database in Taiwan. The primary outcome was the incidence of psoriasis, determined through diagnoses recorded in urgent care, hospital, and outpatient department records. Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regressions with 1:4 propensity score matching was employed to evaluate the risk factors for psoriasis after adjusting for comorbidities and the use of other medications. In 49,810 propensity score-matched adults with T2D (27,630 men [55.4%]; mean age 57.5 years) identified in the database, the incidence rate of psoriasis in DPP-4i users was 188 cases per 100,000 person-years, lower than in sulfonylurea users (467 cases per 100,000 person-years), with a hazard ratio(HR) of 0.422 (95% CI, 0.273-0.716). For the TZD vs. sulfonylurea comparison, the HR was 0.35, but the smaller matched dataset resulted in wide confidence intervals. The findings suggest that the use of DPP-4is is associated with a lower risk of psoriasis compared to sulfonylureas in patients with T2D. These results can guide the selection of glucose-lowering therapies in T2D patients who are at risk of developing psoriasis.","Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal  Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal  Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Department of Internal  Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal  Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal  Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal  Medicine, Wang Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal  Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal  Medicine, Wang Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Biostatistics Center, College of Management, Taipei Medical University, Taipei,  Taiwan.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Idaho State University, Pocatello,  Idaho, USA.; Biostatistics Center, College of Management, Taipei Medical University, Taipei,  Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Data Science, College of Management, Taipei Medical  University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal  Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Department of Internal  Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.",CTS70177 [pii]; 10.1111/cts.70177 [doi],Chen WS; Lin TM; Chang YS; Shen YC; Hsu HC; Kuo TT; Chen SC; Chen JH; Chang CC,ORCID: 0000-0002-0271-0044; ORCID: 0000-0002-0370-181X; ORCID: 0000-0002-2622-7524; ORCID: 0000-0001-8691-920X; ORCID: 0000-0002-1093-6019; ORCID: 0000-0002-3571-7760; ORCID: 0000-0002-3130-4125; ORCID: 0000-0001-6301-191X,© 2025 The Author(s).

36852680,"BACKGROUND: Practice patterns and outcomes associated with the use of oral  anticoagulation for arterial thromboembolism prevention following a hospitalization with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) during sepsis are unclear. METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study of patients ≥40 years of age discharged alive following hospitalization with new-onset AF during sepsis across 21 hospitals in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care delivery system, years 2011 to 2018. Primary outcomes were ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), with a safety outcome of major bleeding events, both within 1 year of discharge alive from sepsis hospitalization. Adjusted risk differences for outcomes between patients who did and did not receive oral anticoagulation within 30 days of discharge were estimated using marginal structural models fitted by inverse probability weighting using Super Learning within a target trial emulation framework. RESULTS: Among 82 748 patients hospitalized with sepsis, 3992 (4.8%) had new-onset AF and survived to hospital discharge; mean age was 78±11 years, 53% were men, and 70% were White. Patients with new-onset AF during sepsis averaged 45±33% of telemetry monitoring entries with AF, and 27% had AF present on the day of hospital discharge. Within 1 year of hospital discharge, 89 (2.2%) patients experienced stroke/TIA, 225 (5.6%) had major bleeding, and 1011 (25%) died. Within 30 days of discharge, 807 (20%) patients filled oral anticoagulation prescriptions, which were associated with higher 1-year adjusted risks of ischemic stroke/TIA (5.69% versus 2.32%; risk difference, 3.37% [95% CI, 0.36-6.38]) and no significant difference in 1-year adjusted risks of major bleeding (6.51% versus 7.10%; risk difference, -0.59% [95% CI, -3.09 to 1.91]). Sensitivity analysis of ischemic stroke-only outcomes showed a risk difference of 0.15% (95% CI, -1.72 to 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: After hospitalization with new-onset AF during sepsis, oral anticoagulation use was uncommon and associated with potentially higher stroke/TIA risk. Further research to inform mechanisms of stroke and TIA and management of new-onset AF after sepsis is needed.","Section of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Boston  University School of Medicine, MA (A.J.W., Y.D.).; The Permanente Medical Group, Oakland, CA (L.C.M., A.S.G., V.X.L.).; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland (L.C.M.,  K.K.T., P.K., A.S.G., Y.W.L., H.C., R.N., V.X.L.).; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland (L.C.M.,  K.K.T., P.K., A.S.G., Y.W.L., H.C., R.N., V.X.L.).; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland (L.C.M.,  K.K.T., P.K., A.S.G., Y.W.L., H.C., R.N., V.X.L.).; Biomedical Informatics Department (M.D.), Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA.; The Permanente Medical Group, Oakland, CA (L.C.M., A.S.G., V.X.L.).; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland (L.C.M.,  K.K.T., P.K., A.S.G., Y.W.L., H.C., R.N., V.X.L.).; Department of Medicine (A.S.G.), Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA.; Department of Health Systems Science, Kaiser Permanente Bernard J.

40499127,"BACKGROUND: Hypoglycaemic drugs (sulfonylureas, glinides or insulins) are  commonly prescribed for older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) but may carry risks of adverse events. Whether de-intensifying hypoglycaemic drugs is associated with clinical benefit in older adults remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between de-intensification of hypoglycaemic drugs and clinical outcomes in older adults with T2D. METHODS: Cohort study conducted with the target trial emulation approach, using data collected from 2000 French general practises between January 2010 and February 2019 (The Health Improvement Network-THIN database). Eligible participants were ≥75 years old, on stable hypoglycaemic drugs (no change in drug or dose) for at least 6 months, and had an HbA1c value <9%. Hypoglycaemic drug de-intensification (exposure) was defined as cessation or reduction of ≥50% of total dose. The primary outcome was a composite measure of all-cause death or hospital admissions within 3 months, and its association with exposure was assessed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for potential baseline confounders. RESULTS: The study included 14 383 unique individuals corresponding to 177 314 trial emulation participants (mean age 80 years; 44.7% female). Of these, 6480 participants were allocated to de-intensification group, and 170 834 to the control group. At 3 months, the primary outcome occurred in 3.96% of the de-intensification group and 2.99% of controls [adjusted relative risk, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.22-1.43)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent associations across most participants' profiles. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with T2D, de-intensification of hypoglycaemic drugs was associated with a higher short-term risk of all-cause death or hospitalisation.","Louvain Drug Research Institute, Université catholique de Louvain, Brussels,  Belgium.; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Brussels, Belgium.; Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, INSERM, Sorbonne  Université, Paris, Île-de-France, France.; Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, INSERM, Sorbonne  Université, Paris, Île-de-France, France.; Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, INSERM, Sorbonne  Université, Paris, Île-de-France, France.; Unité de Recherche Clinique PSL-CFX, CIC-1901, Centre de Pharmacoépidémiologie  (Cephepi), Département de Santé Publique, Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, Île-de-France, France.; Department of Anesthesiology Pharmacology, and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine,  The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; King's College London, London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern  Ireland.; Foundation for Diabetes Research in Older People, Taplow, United Kingdom of Great  Britain and Northern Ireland.; Institute of Health and Society, Université catholique de Louvain, Brussels,  Belgium.; Louvain Drug Research Institute, Université catholique de Louvain, Brussels,  Belgium.; Geriatric Medicine Unit, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.; Institute of Health and Society, Université catholique de Louvain, Brussels,  Belgium.; RESIP, Claude Bernard, Boulogne-sur-mer, France.; RESIP, Claude Bernard, Boulogne-sur-mer, France.; Observatoire des médicaments, dispositifs médicaux, innovations thérapeutiques  d'Île-de-France Paris, Ile de france, France.; Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, INSERM, Sorbonne  Université, Paris, Île-de-France, France.; Oncostat U1018, INSERM, Université Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, Île-de-France,  France.; Bureau de Biostatistique et d'Épidémiologie Gustave Roussy, Université  Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, Île-de-France, France.; Département de gériatrie, Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital, Assistance  Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.; Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, INSERM, Sorbonne  Université, Paris, Île-de-France, France.",8160592 [pii]; afaf160 [pii]; 10.1093/ageing/afaf160 [doi],Christiaens A; Cochard A; Tubach F; Thompson W; Sinclair AJ; Henrard S; Boland B; Slaouti-Jégou Y; Lekens B; Bonnet-Zamponi D; Simon-Tillaux N; Zerah L,ORCID: 0000-0002-4132-7769; ORCID: 0000-0002-7802-944X; ORCID: 0000-0002-0389-8093; ORCID: 0000-0002-3474-2200,© The Author(s) 2025.

39836391,"IMPORTANCE: No large randomized clinical trial has directly compared  empagliflozin with dapagliflozin, leaving their comparative effectiveness regarding kidney outcomes unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare kidney outcomes between initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving antihyperglycemic treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This target trial emulation used nationwide, population-based routinely collected Danish health care data to compare initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who received antihyperglycemic treatment between June 1, 2014, and October 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to August 2024. Persons were followed up until an outcome, emigration, death, 6 years, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first. EXPOSURE: Initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included acute kidney injury, incident chronic kidney disease (stages G3 to G5 or stage A2 or A3), and progression of chronic kidney disease (≥40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline). Risks of kidney outcomes were estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses using an Aalen-Johansen estimator that adjusted for 56 potential confounders and considered death as a competing event. RESULTS: A total of 32 819 individuals who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and 17 464 with dapagliflozin were included (median [IQR] age, 63 [54-71] years; 18 872 female individuals [37.5%]; median [IQR] estimated glomerular filtration rate, 88 [73-104] mL/min/1.73 m2). After weighting, all measured covariates were well balanced between the groups. In intention-to-treat analyses, people who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin exhibited comparable 6-year risks of acute kidney injury (18.2% vs 18.5%; risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06), chronic kidney disease stages G3 to G5 (11.8% vs 12.1%; risk ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89-1.05), chronic kidney disease stage A2 or A3 (14.8% vs 14.3%; risk ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93-1.15), and progression of chronic kidney disease (5.3% vs 5.7%; risk ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.56-1.58). The primary analyses were supported by corresponding per-protocol analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that people with type 2 diabetes who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin had comparable long-term kidney outcomes.","Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital,  Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University,  Atlanta, Georgia.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of  Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Cardiology, Gødstrup Hospital, Herning, Denmark.",2829195 [pii]; ioi240091 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.7381 [doi],Bonnesen K; Heide-Jørgensen U; Christensen DH; Christiansen CF; Lash TL; Hennessy S; Matthews AA; Pedersen L; Thomsen RW; Schmidt M,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Bonnesen reported grants from the Danish  Diabetes and Endocrine Academy, Danish Cardiovascular Academy, Helge Peetz og Verner Peetz og Hustru Vilma Peetz Legat, Danish Data Science Academy, Christian og Ottilia Brorsons Rejselegat, and Karl G.

37577025,"OBJECTIVE: To build on the recently completed GRADE (Glycemia Reduction  Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) randomised trial examining the comparative effectiveness of second line glucose lowering drugs in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Emulation of a target trial. SETTING: Medical and pharmacy claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a de-identified US national dataset of beneficiaries of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage plans, 29 March 2013 to 30 June 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes who first started taking glimepiride, sitagliptin, liraglutide, insulin glargine, or canagliflozin between 29 March 2013 and 30 June 2021. Participants were treatment naive or were receiving metformin monotherapy at the time of starting the study drug. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcomes were time to primary and secondary metabolic failure of the assigned treatment, calculated as days to haemoglobin A(1c) levels of ≥7.0% and >7.5%, respectively. Secondary metabolic, cardiovascular, and microvascular outcomes were analysed as specified in the GRADE statistical analysis plan. Propensity scores were estimated with the gradient boosting method, and inverse propensity score weighting was used to emulate randomisation to the treatment groups, which were then compared with Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: The study cohort included participants starting treatment with glimepiride (n=20 511), liraglutide (n=5569), sitagliptin (n=13 039), insulin glargine (n=7262), and canagliflozin (n=5290). The insulin glargine arm was excluded because of insufficient control of confounding. Median times to primary metabolic failure were 439 (95% confidence interval 400 to 489) days in the canagliflozin arm, 439 (426 to 453) days in the glimepiride arm, 624 (567 to 731) days in the liraglutide arm, and 461 (442 to 482) days in the sitagliptin arm. Median time to secondary metabolic failure was also longest in the liraglutide arm. Adults receiving liraglutide had the lowest one year cumulative incidence rate of primary metabolic failure (0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.40) followed by sitagliptin (0.44, 0.43 to 0.45), glimepiride (0.45, 0.44 to 0.45), and canagliflozin (0.46, 0.44 to 0.48). Similarly, the one year cumulative incidence rate of secondary metabolic failure was 0.27 (0.25 to 0.29) in the canagliflozin arm, 0.28 (0.27 to 0.29) in the glimepiride arm, 0.23 (0.21 to 0.26) in the liraglutide arm, and 0.28 (0.27 to 0.29) in the sitagliptin arm. No differences were observed between the study arms in the rates of microvascular and macrovascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: In this target trial emulation of an expanded GRADE study framework, liraglutide was more effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control as a second line glucose lowering drug than canagliflozin, sitagliptin, or glimepiride.","Robert D and Patricia E Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo  Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; OptumLabs, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA.; Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois,  USA.; Department of Epidemiolgy, Emory University School of Public Health, Atlanta,  Georgia, USA.; Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School  of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut,  USA.; Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale-New Haven Hospital, New Haven,  Connecticut, USA.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, New  Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Robert D and Patricia E Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo  Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; Division of Community Internal Medicine, Geriatrics, and Palliative Care,  Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.",bmjmed-2022-000419 [pii]; 10.1136/bmjmed-2022-000419 [doi],Deng Y; Polley EC; Wallach JD; Herrin J; Ross JS; McCoy RG,ORCID: 0000-0002-2816-6905; ORCID: 0000-0002-9218-3320; ORCID: 0000-0002-2289-3183,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

This study aimed to study the effects of anticoagulation with warfarin on survival in patients with IE, through reducing the risks of thromboembolism and possibly shortening infection time. METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based cohort study using the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System from Hong Kong. Patients diagnosed with IE between January 1, 1997 and August 31, 2020 were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. A target pragmatic trial was emulated using the observational data with cloning-censoring-weighting approach, comparing the treatment effect of initiation warfarin within 14 days versus no warfarin on the risk of all-cause mortality, acute heart failure, and achieving negative blood culture in patients with IE. Pooled logistic regression was applied to estimate 12-week survival or cumulative incidence differences and risk ratios (RRs). RESULTS: A total of 5121 patients with IE with an average age of 55.7 years (SD:18.9) were included. Warfarin use was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality with 12-week survival difference of 6.5% (95% CI, 2.6%-9.9%) and RR of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.57-0.88) and a greater benefit of achieving negative blood cultures with 12-week cumulative incidence difference of 11.4% (95% CI, 5.4%-16.5%) and RR of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.06-1.20) but similar risks of acute heart failure (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.87-1.30]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IE initiating warfarin had significantly lower risk of mortality with potential benefits on achieving negative blood cultures, suggesting benefit in infection resolution but a similar risk of acute heart failure.","Department of Emergency Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine The University of  Hong Kong Hong Kong China.; Cardiovascular Pharmacology Unit, Cardiovascular Analytics Group PowerHealth  Research Institute Hong Kong China.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy University College  London London United Kingdom.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London London United  Kingdom.; Department of Emergency Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine The University of  Hong Kong Hong Kong China.; Cardiovascular Pharmacology Unit, Cardiovascular Analytics Group PowerHealth  Research Institute Hong Kong China.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Clinical Medicine The University of  Hong Kong Hong Kong China.; Cardiovascular Pharmacology Unit, Cardiovascular Analytics Group PowerHealth  Research Institute Hong Kong China.; Cardiovascular Pharmacology Unit, Cardiovascular Analytics Group PowerHealth  Research Institute Hong Kong China.; Tianjin Institute of Cardiology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical  University Tianjin China.; Department of Biomedical Sciences City University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China.; Heart Failure Center, State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease Fuwai  Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Clinical Medicine The University of  Hong Kong Hong Kong China.; Department of Emergency Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine The University of  Hong Kong Hong Kong China.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy University College  London London United Kingdom.; Cardiovascular Pharmacology Unit, Cardiovascular Analytics Group PowerHealth  Research Institute Hong Kong China.; Tianjin Institute of Cardiology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical  University Tianjin China.; School of Nursing and Health Sciences Hong Kong Metropolitan University Hong Kong  China.",10.1161/JAHA.125.041965 [doi],Lee TTL; Ju C; Chan SCL; Chou OHI; Chan JSK; Lee S; Liu T; Cheng SH; Zhang Y; Cheung BMY; Wai AK; Wei L; Tse G,ORCID: 0000-0001-9688-1348; ORCID: 0000-0001-7860-6262; ORCID: 0009-0009-3481-3572; ORCID: 0000-0003-0231-2393; ORCID: 0000-0002-2401-2837; ORCID: 0000-0003-0482-0738; ORCID: 0000-0002-5822-7238; ORCID: 0000-0002-2382-8869; ORCID: 0000-0001-9106-7363; ORCID: 0000-0001-9984-8156; ORCID: 0000-0001-8840-7267; ORCID: 0000-0001-5510-1253,,,,,,2025/07/17 08:23,,20250717,2025 Jul 17,2025/07/17 12:30,,,"Lee, Teddy Tai Loy; Ju, Chengsheng; Chan, Sunny Ching Long; Chou, Oscar Hou In; Chan, Jeffrey Shi Kai; Lee, Sharen; Liu, Tong; Cheng, Shuk Han; Zhang, Yuhui; Cheung, Bernard Man Yung; Wai, Abraham Ka-Chung; Wei, Li; Tse, Gary",,,,,2047-9980,2047-9980,,101580524,Journal of the American Heart Association,eng,10.1161/JAHA.125.041965 [doi],20250717,,2025/07/17 12:30,,,,anticoagulation; causal inference; infective endocarditis; trial emulation,NOTNLM,NLM,e041965,,2025/07/17 08:23,2025/07/17 12:30,,,2025/07/17 12:30,,England,,,aheadofprint,Journal Article,,IM,,J Am Heart Assoc. 2025 Jul 17:e041965. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.125.041965.,Publisher,J Am Heart Assoc,"Effects of Warfarin on the Risks of Mortality, Acute Heart Failure, and Infection  Resolution in Patients With Infective Endocarditis: A Target Trial Emulation.",,,,
39585693,"IMPORTANCE: The practice of deprescribing antihypertensive medications is common  among long-term care residents, yet the effect on cardiovascular outcomes is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of hospitalization for myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke among long-term care residents who are deprescribed or continue antihypertensive therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness research study used target trial emulation with observational electronic health record data from long-term care residents aged 65 years or older admitted to US Department of Veterans Affairs community living centers between October 1, 2006, and September 30, 2019, and taking at least 1 antihypertensive medication. Analyses were conducted between August 2023 and August 2024. EXPOSURE: A reduction in the number of antihypertensive medications or dose (by ≥30%), assessed using barcode medication administration data. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Incidence of MI and stroke hospitalization up to 2 years was assessed using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes. A pooled logistic regression model with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) was used to estimate per-protocol effects. RESULTS: Of 13 096 long-term care residents (97.4% men; median age, 77 years [IQR, 70-84 years]) taking antihypertensive medication, 17.8% were deprescribed antihypertensive medication over a period of 12 weeks. The estimated unadjusted cumulative incidence of stroke or MI hospitalization over 2 years was similar among residents who were and were not deprescribed antihypertensives in per-protocol analyses (11.2% vs 8.8%; difference, 2.4 percentage points [95% CI, -2.3 to 7.1 percentage points]). Participant characteristics were balanced after applying IPTW and IPCW; all standardized mean differences were less than 0.05. After full adjustment for confounding and informative censoring, the per-protocol analysis results showed no association of antihypertensive deprescribing with MI or stroke hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70-1.26). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness research study, deprescribing antihypertensive medication was not associated with risk of hospitalization for MI or stroke in long-term care residents. These findings may be informative for long-term care residents and clinicians who are considering deprescribing antihypertensive medications.","Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California.; Health Economics Resource Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto,  California.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California.; Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Treatment Science, Institute for Health,  Health Care Policy and Aging Research, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.; Department of Pharmacy Practice & Administration, Ernest Mario School of  Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey.; Department of Veterans Affairs-New Jersey Health Care System, East Orange.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California.; Kidney Health Research Collaborative, University of California San Francisco and  San Francisco VA Medical Center, San Francisco.; Habitat Health, San Francisco, California.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California.",2827023 [pii]; zoi241333 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.46851 [doi],Odden MC; Graham LA; Liu X; Dave CV; Lee SJ; Li Y; Jing B; Fung K; Peralta CA; Steinman MA,,,doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.46857,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Dave reported receiving personal fees from  the US Food and Drug Administration and Takeda outside the submitted work.

37690631,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Optimal approaches to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism  (SHPT) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have yet to be established in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). STUDY DESIGN: Two observational clinical trial emulations. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Both emulations included adults receiving in-center HD from a national dialysis organization. The patients who had SHPT in the period between 2009 and 2014, were insured for≥180 days by Medicare as primary payer, and did not have contraindications or poor health status limiting theoretical trial participation. EXPOSURE: The parathyroid hormone (PTH) Target Trial emulation included patients with new-onset SHPT (first PTH 300-600pg/mL), with 2 arms defined as up-titration of either vitamin D sterols or cinacalcet within 30 days (lower target) or no up-titration (higher target). The Agent Trial emulation included patients with a PTH≥300 pg/mL while on≥6μg weekly of vitamin D sterol (paricalcitol equivalent dose) and no prior history of cinacalcet. The 2 arms were defined by the first dose or agent change within 30 days (vitamin D-favoring [vitamin-D was up-titrated] vs cinacalcet-favoring [cinacalcet was added] vs nondefined [neither applies]). Multiple trials per patient were allowed in trial 2. OUTCOME: The primary outcome was all-cause death over 24 months; secondary outcomes included cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization or the composite of CV hospitalization or death. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Pooled logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 1,152 patients in the PTH Target Trial (635 lower target and 517 higher target). There were 2,726 unique patients with 6,727 patient trials in the Agent Trial (6,268 vitamin D-favoring trials and 459 cinacalcet-favoring trials). The lower PTH target approach was associated with reduced adjusted hazard of death (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.52-0.93]), CV hospitalization (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63-0.98]), and their composite (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.61-0.89]). The cinacalcet-favoring approach demonstrated lower adjusted hazard of death compared to the vitamin D-favoring approach (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.62-0.99]), but not of CV hospitalization or the composite outcome. LIMITATIONS: Potential for residual confounding; low use of cinacalcet with low power. CONCLUSIONS: SHPT management that is focused on lower PTH targets may lower mortality and CV disease in patients receiving HD. These findings should be confirmed in a pragmatic randomized trial. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Optimal approaches to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) have not been established in randomized controlled trials. Data from a national dialysis organization was used to identify patients with SHPT in whom escalated treatment may be indicated. The approach to treatment was defined based on observed upward titration of SHPT-controlling medications: earlier titration (lower target) versus delayed titration (higher target); and the choice of medication (cinacalcet vs vitamin D sterols). In the first trial emulation, we estimated a 29% lower rate of death and 26% lower rate of cardiovascular disease or death for patients managed with a lower versus higher target approach. Cinacalcet versus vitamin D-favoring approaches were not consistently associated with outcomes in the second trial emulation. This observational study suggests the need for additional clinical trials of SHPT treatment intensity.","Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, School of Medicine, Duke  University, Durham, North Carolina.; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, School of Medicine, Duke  University, Durham, North Carolina.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North  Carolina.; Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, New York, New York.; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, School of Medicine, Duke  University, Durham, North Carolina.; Department of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas.; Department of Medicine, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.; School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, School of Medicine, Duke  University, Durham, North Carolina; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.; Departments of Medicine and Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia School  of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia.

35851758,"INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are routinely excluded from clinical trials, leading  to the absence or delay in even the most basic pharmacokinetic (PK) information needed for dosing in pregnancy. When available, pregnancy PK studies use a small sample size, resulting in limited safety information. We discuss key study design elements that may enhance the timely availability of pregnancy data, including the role and timing of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate pregnancy safety; efficacy and safety outcome measures; stand-alone protocols, platform trials, single arm studies, sample size and the effect that follow-up time during gestation has on analysis interpretations; and observational studies. DISCUSSION: Pregnancy PK should be studied during drug development, after dosing in non-pregnant persons is established (unless non-clinical or other data raise pregnancy concerns). RCTs should evaluate the safety during pregnancy of priority new HIV agents that are likely to be used by large numbers of females of childbearing age. Key endpoints for pregnancy safety studies include birth outcomes (prematurity, small for gestational age and stillbirth) and neonatal death, with traditional adverse events and infant growth also measured (congenital anomalies are best studied through surveillance). We recommend that viral efficacy be studied as a secondary endpoint of pregnancy RCTs, once PK studies confirm adequate drug exposure in pregnancy. RCTs typically use a stand-alone protocol for new agents. In contrast, master protocols using a platform design can add agents over time, possibly speeding safety data ascertainment. To speed accrual, stand-alone pregnancy trial protocols can include pre-specified starting rules based upon adequate PK levels in pregnancy; and seamless master protocols or platform trials can include a pregnancy PK and safety component. When RCTs are unethical or cost-prohibitive, observational studies should be conducted, preferably using target trial emulation to avoid bias. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy PK needs to be obtained earlier in drug evaluation. Timely RCTs are needed to understand safety in pregnancy for high-priority new HIV agents. RCTs that enrol pregnant women should focus on outcomes unique to pregnancy, and observational studies should focus on questions that RCTs are not equipped to answer.","Department of Biostatistics, Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research, Boston,  Massachusetts, USA.; Harvard T.H.

35073156,"BACKGROUND: Two recent randomized clinical trials of escalating doses of  allopurinol for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) reported no benefits but potentially increased risk for death. Whether the risk could occur in patients with gout and concurrent CKD remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation of allopurinol initiation, allopurinol dose escalation, and achieving target serum urate (SU) level after allopurinol initiation to all-cause mortality in patients with both gout and CKD. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The Health Improvement Network U.K. primary care database (2000 to 2019). PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 40 years or older who had gout and concurrent moderate-to-severe CKD. MEASUREMENTS: The association between allopurinol initiation and all-cause mortality over 5-year follow-up in propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts was examined. Analysis of hypothetical trials were emulated: achieving target SU level (<0.36 mmol/L) versus not achieving target SU level and dose escalation versus no dose escalation for mortality over 5-year follow-up in allopurinol initiators. RESULTS: Mortality was 4.9 and 5.8 per 100 person-years in 5277 allopurinol initiators and 5277 PS-matched noninitiators, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.77 to 0.93]). In the target trial emulation analysis, the HR of mortality for the achieving target SU level group compared with the not achieving target SU level group was 0.87 (CI, 0.75 to 1.01); the HR of mortality for allopurinol in the dose escalation group versus the no dose escalation group was 0.88 (CI, 0.73 to 1.07). LIMITATION: Residual confounding cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSION: In this population-based data, neither allopurinol initiation, nor achieving target SU level with allopurinol, nor allopurinol dose escalation was associated with increased mortality in patients with gout and concurrent CKD.

40280051,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare treatment outcomes in rheumatoid  arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) between initiators of rituximab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and tofacitinib using the Target Trial Emulation Framework. METHODS: We emulated three trials comparing abatacept, tocilizumab, and tofacitinib with rituximab (reference). Patients fulfilling validated RA-ILD algorithms initiating one of these non-TNFi b/tsDMARDs were propensity score (PS)-matched (1:1) using national Veterans Affairs (VA) data from 2006 to 2020. PS models included demographics, comorbidities, general health status indicators, and several RA- and ILD-related severity measures. Composite study outcomes were death and respiratory-related hospitalization, ascertained by VA data and linkages to the National Death Index and Medicare, over three-year (primary) and one-year follow-up periods (secondary). Cox regression models were used to analyze study outcomes adjusting for any unbalanced variables. Several sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the primary cohort, we 1:1 matched abatacept (n = 150), tocilizumab (n = 73), and tofacitinib (n = 94) with equal numbers of rituximab initiators (mean age 68.1-69.4 years, 88-92 % male). There were no significant differences in the primary composite outcome among any of the comparisons (abatacept aHR: 1.03 [0.72, 1.47]; tocilizumab aHR: 1.15 [0.68, 1.93]; tofacitinib aHR: 0.89 [0.54, 1.46]). Secondary, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses supported the main findings. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find significant differences in mortality or respiratory hospitalization between RA-ILD patients initiating different non-TNFi b/tsDMARDs, though estimates were imprecise, and residual confounding may be present. These findings emphasize the need for clinical trials of advanced immunomodulatory therapies in RA-ILD.","University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; Corporal Michael J.

39793598,"BACKGROUND: Uncertainty exists regarding patient outcomes when using TNF  inhibitors versus other biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD). We compared survival and respiratory hospitalisation outcomes following initiation of TNF-inhibitor or non-TNF inhibitor biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD. METHODS: We did a retrospective, active-comparator, new-user, observational cohort study with propensity score matching following the target trial emulation framework using US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic and administrative health records. VA health-care enrollees with rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD and no previous receipt of ILD-directed therapies (eg, antifibrotics) who initiated a TNF inhibitor or non-TNF inhibitor between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2018, were included. Propensity score matching was performed using demographics, health-care use, health behaviours, comorbidity burden, rheumatoid arthritis-related severity factors, and ILD-related severity factors, including baseline forced vital capacity. Study outcomes were respiratory hospitalisation, all-cause mortality, and respiratory-related death over follow-up of up to 3 years, from VA, Medicare, and National Death Index data. People with lived experience of rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD were not involved in the design or conduct of this study. FINDINGS: Of 1047 patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated-ILD who initiated biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs, we matched 237 patients who had initiated TNF inhibitors and 237 who had initiated non-TNF inhibitors (mean age 68 years [SD 9]); 434 (92%) of 474 were male and 40 (8%) were female. Death and respiratory hospitalisation did not significantly differ between groups (adjusted hazard ratio 1·21 [95% CI 0·92-1·58]). Respiratory hospitalisation (1·27 [0·91-1·76]), all-cause mortality (1·15 [0·83-1·60]), and respiratory mortality (1·38 [0·79-2·42]) did not differ between groups. Secondary, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses supported the primary findings. INTERPRETATION: In US veterans with rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD, no difference in outcomes were seen between those who started TNF inhibitors compared to those starting non-TNF biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. These data do not support systematic avoidance of TNF inhibitors in all people with rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD. Comparative efficacy trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD are needed given the potential for residual confounding and selection bias in observational studies.

38379445,"AIM: The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of statin therapy for primary  prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) when initiating therapy at different baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using territory-wide public electronic medical records in Hong Kong, we emulated a sequence of trials on patients with T2DM with elevated LDL-C levels in every calendar month from January 2008 to December 2014. Pooled logistic regression was applied to obtain the hazard ratios for the major CVDs (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure), all-cause mortality and major adverse events (myopathies and liver dysfunction) of statin therapy. RESULTS: The estimated hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of CVD incidence for statin initiation were 0.78 (0.72, 0.84) in patients with baseline LDL-C of 1.8-2.5 mmol/L (i.e., 70-99 mg/dL) and 0.90 (0.88, 0.92) in patients with baseline LDL-C ≥2.6 mmol/L (i.e., ≥100 mg/dL) in intention-to-treat analysis, which was 0.59 (0.51, 0.68) and 0.77 (0.74, 0.81) in per-protocol analysis, respectively. No significant increased risks were observed for the major adverse events. The absolute 10-year risk difference of overall CVD in per-protocol analysis was -7.1% (-10.7%, -3.6%) and -3.9% (-5.1%, -2.7%) in patients with baseline LDL-C 1.8-2.5 and ≥2.6 mmol/L, respectively. The effectiveness and safety were consistently observed in patients aged >75 years initiating statin at both LDL-C thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the threshold of 2.6 mmol/L, initiating statin in patients with a lower baseline LDL-C level at 1.8-2.5 mmol/L can further reduce the risks of CVD and all-cause mortality without significantly increasing the risk of major adverse events in patients with T2DM, including patients aged >75 years.","Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong  Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and  Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology  Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University  College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine,  The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.; Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public  Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston,  Massachusetts, USA.",10.1111/dom.15503 [doi],Wan EYF; Xu W; Mok AHY; Chin WY; Yu EYT; Chui CSL; Chan EWY; Wong ICK; Lam CLK; Danaei G,ORCID: 0000-0002-6275-1147,"© 2024 The Authors.

37491022,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the bivalent mRNA booster vaccines  containing the original SARS-CoV-2 and omicron BA.4-5 or BA.1 subvariants as the fourth dose against severe covid-19. DESIGN: Nationwide cohort analyses, using target trial emulation. SETTING: Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, from 1 July 2022 to 10 April 2023. PARTICIPANTS: People aged ≥50 years who had received at least three doses of covid-19 vaccine (that is, a primary course and a first booster). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to compare the risk of hospital admission and death related to covid-19 in people who received a bivalent Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) or Spikevax (Moderna) BA.4-5 or BA.1 mRNA booster vaccine as a fourth dose (second booster) with three dose (first booster) vaccinated people and between four dose vaccinated people. RESULTS: A total of 1 634 199 people receiving bivalent BA.4-5 fourth dose booster and 1 042 124 receiving bivalent BA.1 fourth dose booster across the four Nordic countries were included. Receipt of a bivalent BA.4-5 booster as a fourth dose was associated with a comparative vaccine effectiveness against admission to hospital with covid-19 of 67.8% (95% confidence interval 63.1% to 72.5%) and a risk difference of -91.9 (95% confidence interval -152.4 to -31.4) per 100 000 people at three months of follow-up compared with having received three doses of vaccine (289 v 893 events). The corresponding comparative vaccine effectiveness and risk difference for bivalent BA.1 boosters (332 v 977 events) were 65.8% (59.1% to 72.4%) and -112.9 (-179.6 to -46.2) per 100 000, respectively. Comparative vaccine effectiveness and risk difference against covid-19 related death were 69.8% (52.8% to 86.8%) and -34.1 (-40.1 to -28.2) per 100 000 for bivalent BA.4-5 booster (93 v 325 events) and 70.0% (50.3% to 89.7%) and -38.7 (-65.4 to -12.0) per 100 000 for BA.1 booster (86 v 286) as a fourth dose. Comparing bivalent BA.4-5 and BA.1 boosters as a fourth dose directly resulted in a three month comparative vaccine effectiveness and corresponding risk difference of -14.9% (-62.3% to 32.4%) and 10.0 (-14.4 to 34.4) per 100 000 people for admission to hospital with covid-19 (802 v 932 unweighted events) and -40.7% (-123.4% to 42.1%) and 8.1 (-3.3 to 19.4) per 100 000 for covid-19 related death (229 v 243 unweighted events). The comparative vaccine effectiveness did not differ across sex and age (</≥70 years) and seemed to be sustained up to six months from the day of vaccination with modest waning. CONCLUSION: Vaccination with bivalent BA.4-5 or BA.1 mRNA booster vaccines as a fourth dose was associated with reduced rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death among adults aged ≥50 years.

36441554,"IMPORTANCE: Results of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated rituximab's  noninferiority to cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV), with neither treatment having a specific advantage for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). However, post hoc analysis results have suggested that rituximab might be more effective than cyclophosphamide in inducing remission in patients with proteinase 3-positive AAV. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of rituximab and cyclophosphamide in inducing GPA remission in a large population of unselected patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study used multicenter target trial emulation observational data from 32 French hospitals in the French Vasculitis Study Group Registry. Groups were determined according to treatments received, without any intervention from the investigators. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to correct for baseline imbalance between groups. Participants included patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GPA who satisfied American College of Rheumatology classification criteria and/or Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022. EXPOSURES: At least 1 infusion of rituximab or cyclophosphamide for induction therapy between April 1, 2008, and April 1, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was remission rate at month 6 (±2 months), with remission defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of 0 and prednisone dose of 10 mg/d or less. The BVAS is a validated tool for small-vessel vasculitis and used to assess the level of disease activity, with a numerical weight attached to each involved organ system. The BVAS has a range of 0 to 63 points; a score of 0 indicates no disease activity. Subgroup analyses included the primary outcome for patients with a new diagnosis, for most recently treated patients, and for patients with myeloperoxidase-ANCA positivity. RESULTS: Among 194 patients with GPA included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 54 [15] years; 110 men [56.7%]), 165 (85.1%) had a new diagnosis, and 147 of 182 with data available (80.8%) had proteinase 3-ANCA positivity. Sixty-one patients received rituximab and 133 received cyclophosphamide for induction therapy. In the weighted analysis, the primary outcome was reached for 73.1% of patients receiving rituximab vs 40.1% receiving cyclophosphamide (relative risk [RR], 1.82 [95% CI, 1.22-2.73]; risk difference, 33.0% [95% CI, 12.2%-53.8%]; E value for RR, 3.05). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of patients with newly diagnosed GPA and those with a more recent treatment. In the subset of 27 patients with myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA, 8 of 10 rituximab recipients and 8 of 17 cyclophosphamide recipients met the primary end point (unweighted RR, 1.73 [95% CI, 0.96-3.11]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparativeness effectiveness study using clinical data, rituximab induction therapy for GPA was more frequently associated with remission than cyclophosphamide. These results inform clinical decision-making concerning the choice of remission induction therapy for this subset of patients with AAV.","National Referral Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Hôpital Cochin,  Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Centre, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; National Referral Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Hôpital Cochin,  Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Centre, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine Specialties, Geneva  University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.; Hôtel-Dieu, AP-HP, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, François Mitterrand  University Hospital, Dijon, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Côte-d'Argent, Dax, France.; Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Rennes-Sud University  Hospital, Rennes, France.; Department of Nephrology, Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP Centre,  Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, Centre Hospitalier, Niort, France.; Department of Nephrology and Internal Medicine, Centre Hospitalier, Valenciennes,  France.; Department of Internal Medicine, Côte-de-Nacre University Hospital, Caen, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, Gabriel Montpied University Hospital,  Clermont-Ferrand, France.; National Referral Center for Rare Pulmonary Diseases, Louis-Pradel Hospital,  Claude-Bernard University Lyon 1, Lyon, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hôtel-Dieu University Hospital, Nantes, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, Gabriel Montpied University Hospital,  Clermont-Ferrand, France.; National Referral Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Hôpital Cochin,  Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Centre, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; National Referral Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Hôpital Cochin,  Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Centre, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; National Referral Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Hôpital Cochin,  Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Centre, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Hôtel-Dieu, AP-HP, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Hôtel-Dieu, AP-HP, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; National Referral Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Hôpital Cochin,  Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Centre, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.",2799018 [pii]; zoi221232 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.43799 [doi],Puéchal X; Iudici M; Perrodeau E; Bonnotte B; Lifermann F; Le Gallou T; Karras A; Blanchard-Delaunay C; Quéméneur T; Aouba A; Aumaître O; Cottin V; Hamidou M; Ruivard M; Cohen P; Mouthon L; Guillevin L; Ravaud P; Porcher R; Terrier B,,,,French Vasculitis Study Group,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Puéchal reported receiving grant funding  from Roche Pharma Ltd and congress registration from GlaxoSmithKline outside the submitted work.

40193118,"IMPORTANCE: The association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists  (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) remains to be confirmed. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of ADRD associated with GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This target trial emulation study used electronic health record data from OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium from January 2014 to June 2023. Patients were 50 years or older with T2D and no prior diagnosis of ADRD or antidementia treatment. Among the 396 963 eligible patients with T2D, 33 858 were included in the GLP-1RA vs other glucose-lowering drug (GLD) cohort, 34 185 in the SGLT2i vs other GLD cohort, and 24 117 in the GLP-1RA vs SGLT2i cohort. EXPOSURES: Initiation of treatment with a GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, or other second-line GLD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: ADRD was identified using clinical diagnosis codes. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: This study included 33 858 patients in the GLP-1RA vs other GLD cohort (mean age, 65 years; 53.1% female), 34 185 patients in the SGLT2i vs other GLD cohort (mean age, 65.8 years; 49.3% female), and 24 117 patients in the GLP-1RA vs SGLT2i cohort (mean age, 63.8 years; 51.7% female). In IPTW-weighted cohorts, the incidence rate of ADRD was lower in GLP-1RA initiators compared with other GLD initiators (rate difference [RD], -2.26 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -2.88 to -1.64]), yielding an HR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.96). SGLT2i initiators had a lower incidence than other GLD initiators (RD, -3.05 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -3.68 to -2.42]), yielding an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75). There was no difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is, with an RD of -0.09 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, -0.80 to 0.63) and an HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72-1.32). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In people with T2D, both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were statistically significantly associated with decreased risk of ADRD compared with other GLDs, and no difference was observed between both drugs.","Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida College of  Pharmacy, Gainesville.; Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville.; Department of Neurology and McKnight Brain Institute, College of Medicine,  University of Florida, Gainesville.; 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of Florida, Gainesville.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida College of  Pharmacy, Gainesville.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida College of  Pharmacy, Gainesville.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida College of  Pharmacy, Gainesville.; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville.; Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine,  University of Florida, Gainesville.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida College of  Pharmacy, Gainesville.; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville.",2831976 [pii]; noi250010 [pii]; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.0353 [doi],Tang H; Donahoo WT; DeKosky ST; Lee YA; Kotecha P; Svensson M; Bian J; Guo J,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Tang reported receiving grants from  Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Foundation during the conduct of the study.

39312220,"IMPORTANCE: Antihypertensive medication deprescribing is common among nursing  home residents, yet its association with cognitive decline remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of deprescribing antihypertensive medication with changes in cognitive function in nursing home residents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study using a target trial emulation approach included VA long-term care residents aged 65 years or older with stays of at least 12 weeks from 2006 to 2019. Residents who were not prescribed antihypertensive medication, with blood pressure greater than 160/90 mm Hg, or with heart failure were excluded. Eligible residents with stable medication use for 4 weeks were classified into deprescribing or stable user groups and followed for 2 years or until death or discharge for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Participants switching treatment groups were censored in the per-protocol analysis. Cognitive function measurements during follow-up were analyzed using an ordinal generalized linear mixed model, adjusting for confounders with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Per-protocol analysis included inverse probability of censoring weighting. Data analyses were performed from May 1, 2023, and July 1, 2024. EXPOSURES: Deprescribing was defined as a reduction in the total number of antihypertensive medications or a decrease in medication dosage by 30%, sustained for a minimum of 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cognitive Function Scale (CFS) was classified as cognitively intact (CFS = 1), mildly impaired (CFS = 2), moderately impaired (CFS = 3), and severely impaired (CFS = 4). RESULTS: Of 45 183 long-term care residents, 12 644 residents (mean [SD] age 77.7 [8.3] years; 329 [2.6%] females and 12 315 [97.4%] males) and 12 053 residents (mean [SD] age 77.7 [8.3] years; 314 [2.6%] females and 11 739 [97.4%] males) met eligibility for ITT and per-protocol analyses, respectively. At the end of the follow-up, 12.0% of residents had a worsened CFS (higher score) and 7.7% had an improved CFS (lower score) with 10.8% of the deprescribing group and 12.1% of the stable user group showing a worsened CFS score. In the per-protocol analysis, the deprescribing group had a 12% reduction in the odds of progressing to a worse CFS category per 12-week period (odds ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99) compared to the stable user group. Among residents with dementia, deprescribing was associated with 16% reduced odds of cognitive decline (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98). These patterns remained consistent in the ITT analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study indicates that deprescribing is associated with less cognitive decline in nursing home residents, particularly those with dementia. More data are needed to understand the benefits and harms of antihypertensive deprescribing to inform patient-centered medication management in nursing homes.","Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco Veterans  Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.; Northern California Institute for Research and Education, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California.; Health Economics Resource Center, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System,  Palo Alto, California.; Stanford-Surgery Policy Improvement Research and Education Center, Department of  Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, California.; Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Treatment Science, Institute for Health,  Health Care Policy and Aging Research; Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.; Department of Pharmacy Practice and Administration, Ernest Mario School of  Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey.; Department of Veterans Affairs, New Jersey Health Care System, East Orange, New  Jersey.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco Veterans  Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.; Section of Geriatrics, Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Stanford  University, School of Medicine, Stanford, California.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto  Health Care System, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California.; Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine,  University of Southern California, Los Angeles.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco Veterans  Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San  Francisco.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco Veterans  Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San  Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco Veterans  Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford,  California.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto  Health Care System, Palo Alto, California.",2823919 [pii]; ioi240061 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.4851 [doi],Jing B; Liu X; Graham LA; Dave CV; Li Y; Fung K; Liu CK; Abdel Magid HS; Growdon ME; Deardorff WJ; Boscardin WJ; Lee SJ; Steinman MA; Odden MC,,,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Dave reported consulting fees from CERobs  Consulting outside the submitted work.

40388132,"IMPORTANCE: Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), such as tiotropium, are  inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilators. However, there is limited clinical evidence examining whether LAMAs may have clinically meaningful central anticholinergic effects, such as increased dementia risk. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between tiotropium initiation and dementia risk in older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based, active-comparator, new-user cohort study used linkable administrative databases from Ontario, Canada, with a target trial emulation framework. The cohort included new users of tiotropium monotherapy or a long-acting β2-agonist plus inhaled corticosteroid (LABA-ICS) who were 66 years or older with COPD and without dementia, from September 4, 2004, to February 29, 2012. The follow-up period was up to 10 years from treatment initiation. Analyses were conducted from May 13, 2024, to March 6, 2025. EXPOSURES: Tiotropium monotherapy initiators were compared with LABA-ICS initiators. The primary analysis used an intention-to-treat exposure definition. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident dementia was determined using a validated algorithm. A 1-year lag time was implemented to mitigate reverse causality and to account for disease latency. Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) with death as a competing risk were obtained from Cox models with propensity score fine stratification weights. Weighted incidence rate differences (IRDs) per 1000 person-years were calculated. RESULTS: Among 30 960 tiotropium monotherapy initiators and 19 530 LABA-ICS initiators, the mean (SD) age was 75.1 (6.7) years and 46.7% were female. Over a median (IQR) follow-up period of 7.59 (3.91-10.0) years from treatment initiation, tiotropium monotherapy vs LABA-ICS initiation was associated with a small increase in dementia risk per 1000 person-years (incidence rates, 29.6 [95% CI, 28.8-30.4] vs 27.4 [95% CI, 26.4-28.3]; IRD, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.0-3.5]; HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.14]). The secondary as-treated analysis showed no significant association per 1000 person-years (incidence rates, 24.1 [95% CI, 22.2-26.0] vs 21.4 [95% CI, 18.5-24.3]; IRD, 2.7 [95% CI, -0.8 to 6.1]; HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.93-1.32]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, among older adults with COPD, the small absolute rate increase in incident dementia associated with tiotropium monotherapy vs LABA-ICS was of questionable clinical importance, particularly when weighed against the established clinical benefits of tiotropium.","Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,  Canada.; Dr. Sandra Black Centre for Brain Resilience and Recovery, Hurvitz Brain Sciences  Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES uOttawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa,  Ontario, Canada.; Inflammation and Chronic Disease Program, The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,  Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,  Canada.; Dr. Sandra Black Centre for Brain Resilience and Recovery, Hurvitz Brain Sciences  Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES uOttawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; University of Ottawa Heart Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario,  Canada.; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario,  Canada.; University of Ottawa Heart Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario,  Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,  Canada.; Dr. Sandra Black Centre for Brain Resilience and Recovery, Hurvitz Brain Sciences  Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; KITE University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.",2833830 [pii]; ioi250023 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1251 [doi],Wu CY; Kendzerska T; Wang C; Xiong LY; Edwards JD; Liu PP; Saskin R; Swardfager W,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Mr Wu reported receiving financial support from  the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR; Doctoral Research Award and Canada Graduate Scholarships; 202111FBD-47623-75801), Heart-Brain Connection Brain-Heart Research Integrative Innovation Team Endeavor (BHRIITE) IMPACT Award from Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, Brain Canada, and the Brain-Heart Interconnectome Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF) program.

39418202,"BACKGROUND: Data on the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists  (GLP-1RAs) on pancreatic cancer incidence are limited and inconsistent. Here we evaluate the association of GLP-1RAs, alone and in combinations, with incident pancreatic cancer risk in a real-world population, stratified by obesity and smoking status. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were prescribed GLP-1RAs or other nonglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications between January 2013 and March 2019 and had no prior diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The incident (first-time) diagnosis of pancreatic cancer during a 5-year follow-up was compared between propensity-score matched cohorts of patients prescribed GLP-1RAs vs other nonglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients stratified by the status of obesity and tobacco use disorder. We also compared GLP-1RA combination therapies with monotherapies. Time-to-first-event analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval calculated. RESULTS: The study population comprised 1 636 056 eligible patients including 167 091 prescribed GLP-1RAs and 1 468 965 prescribed other antidiabetes medications. GLP-1RAs were associated with a statistically significant decreased risk for pancreatic cancer incidence compared with each of 6 nonglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications with hazard ratios ranging from 0.42 to 0.82. The reduction was greater in patients with obesity and tobacco use disorder than in those without. GLP-1RA combination therapies were associated with lower pancreatic cancer risk compared with monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RAs were associated with reduced pancreatic cancer incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further studies and trials are needed to explore mechanisms and confirm causal effects.","Center for Science, Health, and Society, Case Western Reserve University School  of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, United States.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, United States.; Department of Family Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903,  United States.; University of Virginia Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Virginia,  Charlottesville, VA 22908, United States.; Center for Clinical Informatics Research and Education, The MetroHealth System,  Cleveland, OH 44109, United States.; Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, Case Western Reserve  University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, United States.; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of  Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, United States.",7825367 [pii]; djae260 [pii]; 10.1093/jnci/djae260 [doi],Wang L; Wang Q; Li L; Kaelber DC; Xu R,ORCID: 0000-0003-1802-9517; ORCID: 0000-0001-7855-9515; ORCID: 0000-0003-3127-4795,"© The Author(s) 2024.

39823513,"BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid) is indicated for patients with  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression to severe disease due to the presence of one or more risk factors. Millions of treatment courses have been prescribed in the United States alone. Paxlovid was highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death in clinical trials. Several studies have found a protective association in real-world data, but they variously used less recent study periods, correlational methods, and small, local cohorts. Their estimates also varied widely. The real-world effectiveness of Paxlovid remains uncertain, and it is unknown whether its effect is homogeneous across demographic strata. This study leverages electronic health record data in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) repository to investigate disparities in Paxlovid treatment and to emulate a target trial assessing its effectiveness in reducing severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This target trial emulation used a cohort of 703,647 patients with COVID-19 seen at 34 clinical sites across the United States between April 1, 2022 and August 28, 2023. Treatment was defined as receipt of a Paxlovid prescription within 5 days of the patient's COVID-19 index date (positive test or diagnosis). To emulate randomization, we used the clone-censor-weight technique with inverse probability of censoring weights to balance a set of covariates including sex, age, race and ethnicity, comorbidities, community well-being index (CWBI), prior healthcare utilization, month of COVID-19 index, and site of care provision. The primary outcome was hospitalization; death was a secondary outcome. We estimated that Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization by 39% (95% confidence interval (CI) [36%, 41%]; p < 0.001), with an absolute risk reduction of 0.9 percentage points (95% CI [0.9, 1.0]; p < 0.001), and reduced the risk of death by 61% (95% CI [55%, 67%]; p < 0.001), with an absolute risk reduction of 0.2 percentage points (95% CI [0.1, 0.2]; p < 0.001). We also conducted stratified analyses by vaccination status and age group. Absolute risk reduction for hospitalization was similar among patients that were vaccinated and unvaccinate, but was much greater among patients aged 65+ years than among younger patients. We observed disparities in Paxlovid treatment, with lower rates among black and Hispanic or Latino patients, and within socially vulnerable communities. This study's main limitation is that it estimates causal effects using observational data and could be biased by unmeasured confounding. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of Paxlovid's real-world effectiveness, we observed that Paxlovid is effective at preventing hospitalization and death, including among vaccinated patients, and particularly among older patients. This remains true in the era of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron subvariants. However, disparities in Paxlovid treatment rates imply that the benefit of Paxlovid's effectiveness is not equitably distributed.","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United  States of America.; RTI International, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.; School of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Johns Hopkins University,  Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; RTI International, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.; School of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Johns Hopkins University,  Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; RTI International, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.; Patient-Led Research Collaborative, New York, New York State, United States of  America.; Patient-Led Research Collaborative, New York, New York State, United States of  America.; University of Rochester, Department of Public Health Sciences and Department of  Economics, Rochester, New York State, United States of America.; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United  States of America.; School of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Johns Hopkins University,  Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, United States  of America.; National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases, Office of the  Director, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; F.

39186787,"BACKGROUND: Both sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and  glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may have neuroprotective effects in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, their comparative effectiveness in preventing dementia remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk for dementia between SGLT2 inhibitors and dulaglutide (a GLP-1 RA). DESIGN: Target trial emulation study. SETTING: Nationwide health care data of South Korea obtained from the National Health Insurance Service between 2010 and 2022. PATIENTS: Patients aged 60 years or older who have T2D and are initiating treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors or dulaglutide. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the presumed clinical onset of dementia. The date of onset was defined as the year before the date of dementia diagnosis, assuming that the time between the onset of dementia and diagnosis was 1 year. The 5-year risk ratios and risk differences comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with dulaglutide were estimated in a 1:2 propensity score-matched cohort adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 12 489 patients initiating SGLT2 inhibitor treatment (51.9% dapagliflozin and 48.1% empagliflozin) and 1075 patients initiating dulaglutide treatment were included. In the matched cohort, over a median follow-up of 4.4 years, the primary outcome event occurred in 69 participants in the SGLT2 inhibitor group and 43 in the dulaglutide group. The estimated risk difference was -0.91 percentage point (95% CI, -2.45 to 0.63 percentage point), and the estimated risk ratio was 0.81 (CI, 0.56 to 1.16). LIMITATION: Residual confounding is possible; there was no adjustment for hemoglobin A(1c) levels or duration of diabetes; the study is not representative of newer drugs, including more effective GLP-1 RAs; and the onset of dementia was not measured directly. CONCLUSION: Under conventional statistical criteria, a risk for dementia between 2.5 percentage points lower and 0.6 percentage point greater for SGLT2 inhibitors than for dulaglutide was estimated to be highly compatible with the data from this study. However, whether these findings generalize to newer GLP-1 RAs is uncertain. Thus, further studies incorporating newer drugs within these drug classes and better addressing residual confounding are required.

37126810,"The COVID-19 vaccines were developed and rigorously evaluated in randomized  trials during 2020. However, important questions, such as the magnitude and duration of protection, their effectiveness against new virus variants, and the effectiveness of booster vaccination, could not be answered by randomized trials and have therefore been addressed in observational studies. Analyses of observational data can be biased because of confounding and because of inadequate design that does not consider the evolution of the pandemic over time and the rapid uptake of vaccination. Emulating a hypothetical ""target trial"" using observational data assembled during vaccine rollouts can help manage such potential sources of bias. This article describes 2 approaches to target trial emulation. In the sequential approach, on each day, eligible persons who have not yet been vaccinated are matched to a vaccinated person. The single-trial approach sets a single baseline at the start of the rollout and considers vaccination as a time-varying variable. The nature of the confounding depends on the analysis strategy: Estimating ""per-protocol"" effects (accounting for vaccination of initially unvaccinated persons after baseline) may require adjustment for both baseline and ""time-varying"" confounders. These issues are illustrated by using observational data from 2 780 931 persons in the United Kingdom aged 70 years or older to estimate the effect of a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Addressing the issues discussed in this article should help authors of observational studies provide robust evidence to guide clinical and policy decisions.","The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom  (E.M.F.H., T.P.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom (E.W.,  H.I.M., K.B., A.S., C.T.R., L.T., I.J.D., S.J.W.E., L.S.).; Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom  (E.M.F.H., T.P.).; The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, Nuffield Department of Primary  Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (W.J.H., A.G., A.J.W., H.J.C., C.E.M., B.M., R.C., A.M., S.B., D.E., P.I., S.D., B.G.).; Department of Epidemiology, Department of Biostatistics, and CAUSALab, Harvard  T.H.

37037034,"BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary guidelines recommend parathyroidectomy to slow the  progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Limited data address the effect of parathyroidectomy on long-term kidney function. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of a sustained decline in eGFR of at least 50% among patients with PHPT treated with parathyroidectomy versus nonoperative management. DESIGN: Target trial emulation was done using observational data from adults with PHPT, using an extended Cox model with time-varying inverse probability weighting. SETTING: Veterans Health Administration. PATIENTS: Patients with a new biochemical diagnosis of PHPT in 2000 to 2019. MEASUREMENTS: Sustained decline of at least 50% from pretreatment eGFR. RESULTS: Among 43 697 patients with PHPT (mean age, 66.8 years), 2928 (6.7%) had a decline of at least 50% in eGFR over a median follow-up of 4.9 years. The weighted cumulative incidence of eGFR decline was 5.1% at 5 years and 10.8% at 10 years in patients managed with parathyroidectomy, compared with 5.1% and 12.0%, respectively, in those managed nonoperatively. The adjusted hazard of eGFR decline did not differ between parathyroidectomy and nonoperative management (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.16]). Subgroup analyses found no heterogeneity of treatment effect based on pretreatment kidney function. Parathyroidectomy was associated with a reduced hazard of the primary outcome among patients younger than 60 years (HR, 0.75 [CI, 0.59 to 0.93]) that was not evident among those aged 60 years or older (HR, 1.08 [CI, 0.87 to 1.34]). LIMITATION: Analyses were done in a predominantly male cohort using observational data. CONCLUSION: Parathyroidectomy had no effect on long-term kidney function in older adults with PHPT. Potential benefits related to kidney function should not be the primary consideration for PHPT treatment decisions.

39836397,"IMPORTANCE: Evidence on cardiovascular benefits and safety of sodium-glucose  cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors is mainly from placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, the comparative effectiveness and safety of individual SGLT-2 inhibitors remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of canagliflozin or dapagliflozin with empagliflozin for a composite outcome (myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke), heart failure hospitalization, MI, stroke, all-cause death, and safety outcomes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), lower-limb amputation, bone fracture, severe urinary tract infection (UTI), and genital infection and whether effects differed by dosage or cardiovascular disease (CVD) history. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study using target trial emulation included adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using 3 US claims databases using data from August 2014 through June 2020. The study was conducted from August 2023 to July 2024, with a follow-up period of up to 8 years, and the analysis was completed in July 2024. EXPOSURES: First dispensing of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin without any use of SGLT-2 inhibitors during the prior 365 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Database-specific models were weighted using propensity score matching-weights to adjust for 129 confounders. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for outcomes were estimated using weighted Cox proportional hazards models. HRs were pooled across databases using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: : Across the databases, 232 890 patients receiving canagliflozin, 129 881 patients receiving dapagliflozin, and 295 043 patients receiving empagliflozin were identified. Compared with empagliflozin initiators, those receiving canagliflozin or dapagliflozin were less likely to have diabetes-related conditions or a history of CVD at baseline. For MI/stroke risk, both canagliflozin (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.05) and dapagliflozin (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89-1.03) were comparable to empagliflozin. For heart failure hospitalization, dapagliflozin initiators had a higher risk (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39), particularly at the low dose of 5 mg (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.12-1.50). These findings were consistent across subgroups of CVD history. For safety events, compared with empagliflozin, canagliflozin initiators had a lower risk of genital infections (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.97) but a higher risk of severe UTIs (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24), and dapagliflozin initiators had lower risks of genital infections (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.95) and DKA (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68-0.90). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that individual SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated comparable cardiovascular effectiveness at clinically effective doses, though low-dose dapagliflozin showed a reduced benefit for heart failure hospitalization compared with empagliflozin.","Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Formally with Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.; Now with: Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, Titusville, New Jersey.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Renal (Kidney) Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's  Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; New England Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Boston  Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.; Divisions of Cardiovascular and Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts General Hospital Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School,  Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.",2829196 [pii]; ioi240090 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.7357 [doi],Shin H; Paik JM; Everett BM; DiCesare E; Alix C; Glynn RJ; Wexler DJ; Patorno E,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Everett reported grants from Novo Nordisk  for site coinvestigator, personal fees from Novo Nordisk for endpoint adjudication, grants from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, principal investigator of a grant to Brigham and Women's Hospital, and personal fees from Kowa not clearly relevant to the work; personal fees from Ipsen Pharmaceuticals for consulting, and personal fees from NIDDK outside the submitted work; and consulting (editorial board member) for the American Heart Association journal Circulation, and royalties for peer review of UptoDate articles.

39549485,"OBJECTIVES: Current guidelines suggest treating poor-prognosis eosinophilic  granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) with a combination of glucocorticoids (GCs) plus cyclophosphamide (CYC). However, there is little data to support the need for the addition of CYC. The objective of this study was to compare GCs plus CYC to GCs alone as induction therapy in poor-prognosis EGPA. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using observational data from a European multicenter retrospective database. We included patients with newly diagnosed EGPA with a 1996 Five Factor Score (FFS) of at least 1, treated with GCs or GCs plus CYC between June 1985 and November 2018. Propensity score analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders. Primary outcome was relapse at 12months. Secondary outcomes included major relapse at 12months and GC-dependent asthma and/or ear nose and throat (ENT) manifestations at 24months. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients were included: 47 % were male and the mean age at diagnosis was 52 (±16 years); 26 % were treated with GCs alone and 74 % with GCs plus CYC. After adjustment, the risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.24, 95%CI [0.08-0.67], p = 0.007), major relapse (HR: 0.24, 95%CI [0.07-0.85], p = 0.026) and the proportion of GC-dependent asthma and/or ENT manifestations (odds ratio:0.30, 95%CI [0.14-0.66], p = 0.003) were lower in the GCs plus CYC group compared to the GCs alone group. CONCLUSION: This target trial emulation study shows that the addition of CYC to GCs reduces the risk of vasculitis relapse and the rate of GC-dependent asthma and/or ENT manifestations in patients with poor-prognosis EGPA.","Department of Internal Medicine, Cochin Hospital, National Referral Center for  Rare Systemic Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Diseases of Ile de France, East and West, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris, F-75014 Paris, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, Cochin Hospital, National Referral Center for  Rare Systemic Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Diseases of Ile de France, East and West, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris, F-75014 Paris, France.; Nephrology and Dialysis Unit, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Department of  Rheumatology, Unidade Local de Saúde do Algarve, Portugal.; Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Center - University  of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.; Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Firenze, Firenze,  Italy.; Department of Internal Medicine, Cochin Hospital, National Referral Center for  Rare Systemic Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Diseases of Ile de France, East and West, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris, F-75014 Paris, France; Division of rheumatology, Geneva University Hospitals and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Internal Medicine, Rheumatology, Pulmonology, Nephrology and  Diabetology and Immunology, ERN-RITA Reference Center, Vasculitis-Center Tübingen-Kirchheim, Medius Kliniken Kirchheim, University of Tübingen, Kirchheim-Teck, Germany.; Department of Rheumatology, IRCCS Policlinico S.

39365115,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 treatment guidelines recommend baricitinib or tocilizumab  for the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We compared the effectiveness of baricitinib vs. tocilizumab on mortality and clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, propensity-weighted cohort study using a target trial emulation approach. SETTING: The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which is the largest electronic health records data on COVID-19 in the United States. The setting included 75 hospitals. PATIENTS: Adults who were hospitalized for COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Newly initiated on baricitinib or tocilizumab. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We used propensity scores with inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) to control bias and confounding while comparing treatments. Among 10,661 individuals included in the study, 6,229 (58.4%) received baricitinib and 4,432 (41.6%) tocilizumab. Overall, the mean age of the cohort was 60.0 ± 15.1 years, 6429 (60.3%) were male, and 19.2% received invasive mechanical ventilation. After IPTW adjustment, baricitinib use was associated with lower 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98) and hospital (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.94) mortality compared with tocilizumab. Baricitinib was also associated with shorter hospital length of stay (incident rate ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.94) and lower rates of hospital-acquired infections (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99), although no difference in ICU length of stay was noted between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, diverse cohort of U.S. hospitalized adults with COVID-19, baricitinib was associated with significantly lower 28-day mortality, hospital mortality, shorter hospital length of stay, and less hospital-acquired infections compared with tocilizumab.","Faculty of Medicine and Health, School of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney,  Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Department of Pharmacy, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.; Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of  Public Health, Baltimore, MD.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  Baltimore, MD.; Medical Research Institute of New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand.; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,  VIC, Australia.; Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand.; Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of  Public Health, Baltimore, MD.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  Baltimore, MD.; Division of General Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD.; Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of  Public Health, Baltimore, MD.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  Baltimore, MD.",00003246-202501000-00004 [pii]; 10.1097/CCM.0000000000006444 [doi],Patanwala AE; Xiao X; Hills TE; Higgins AM; McArthur CJ; Alexander GC; Mehta HB,ORCID: 0000-0003-3999-4703,"Copyright © 2024 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer  Health, Inc.

38648065,"IMPORTANCE: Limited evidence exists on the association between initiation of  antihypertensive medication and risk of fractures in older long-term nursing home residents. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between antihypertensive medication initiation and risk of fracture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation for data derived from 29 648 older long-term care nursing home residents in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) from January 1, 2006, to October 31, 2019. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021, to November 11, 2023. EXPOSURE: Episodes of antihypertensive medication initiation were identified, and eligible initiation episodes were matched with comparable controls who did not initiate therapy. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was nontraumatic fracture of the humerus, hip, pelvis, radius, or ulna within 30 days of antihypertensive medication initiation. Results were computed among subgroups of residents with dementia, across systolic and diastolic blood pressure thresholds of 140 and 80 mm Hg, respectively, and with use of prior antihypertensive therapies. Analyses were adjusted for more than 50 baseline covariates using 1:4 propensity score matching. RESULTS: Data from 29 648 individuals were included in this study (mean [SD] age, 78.0 [8.4] years; 28 952 [97.7%] male). In the propensity score-matched cohort of 64 710 residents (mean [SD] age, 77.9 [8.5] years), the incidence rate of fractures per 100 person-years in residents initiating antihypertensive medication was 5.4 compared with 2.2 in the control arm. This finding corresponded to an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.42 (95% CI, 1.43-4.08) and an adjusted excess risk per 100 person-years of 3.12 (95% CI, 0.95-6.78). Antihypertensive medication initiation was also associated with higher risk of severe falls requiring hospitalizations or emergency department visits (HR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.53-2.13]) and syncope (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.30-2.19]). The magnitude of fracture risk was numerically higher among subgroups of residents with dementia (HR, 3.28 [95% CI, 1.76-6.10]), systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher (HR, 3.12 [95% CI, 1.71-5.69]), diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or higher (HR, 4.41 [95% CI, 1.67-11.68]), and no recent antihypertensive medication use (HR, 4.77 [95% CI, 1.49-15.32]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings indicated that initiation of antihypertensive medication was associated with elevated risks of fractures and falls. These risks were numerically higher among residents with dementia, higher baseline blood pressures values, and no recent antihypertensive medication use. Caution and additional monitoring are advised when initiating antihypertensive medication in this vulnerable population.","Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Treatment Science, Institute for Health,  Health Care Policy and Aging Research, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.; Department of Pharmacy Practice and Administration, Ernest Mario School of  Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey.; Department of Veterans Affairs-New Jersey Health Care System, East Orange.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Medicine, Stanford  University, Stanford, California.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco, San Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco, San Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Medicine, Stanford  University, Stanford, California.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California.; Health Economics Resource Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto,  California.; Department of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle.; Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California San  Francisco, San Francisco.; Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care Service Line, San Francisco VA Medical  Center, San Francisco, California.; Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Palo Alto Health Care  System, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Medicine, Stanford  University, Stanford, California.",2818019 [pii]; ioi240013 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.0507 [doi],Dave CV; Li Y; Steinman MA; Lee SJ; Liu X; Jing B; Graham LA; Marcum ZA; Fung KZ; Odden MC,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Steinman reported receiving grants from the  National Institutes of Health during the conduct of the study, honoraria from the American Geriatrics Society, and royalties from UpToDate outside the submitted work.

40112174,"BACKGROUND: Patients with psoriasis have a higher baseline risk of herpes zoster  (HZ) than the general population. This has raised concerns that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitor use may be associated with an increased risk of HZ. However, the risk profiles for newer biologics, including interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12/23 and IL-23 inhibitors, remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To compare the risks of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in patients with psoriasis using different biologics (ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab, etanercept and adalimumab) vs. traditional systemic treatments (TSTs). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (2011-2021). We included patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis aged ≥ 20 years who had been treated with biologics or TSTs for at least 6 months. We classified patients by individual biologics or TST and followed them for up to 2.5 years from drug initiation until the occurrence of outcome events or death. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of HZ. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for covariates, including patient age, sex, comorbidities and comedications. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the risk of HZ with different biologics. RESULTS: We identified 815, 1870, 1095, 2327, 261, 303 and 98 patients with psoriasis who were taking etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab and guselkumab, respectively. Compared with patients receiving TSTs, for those receiving ustekinumab and guselkumab the risk of HZ trended lower [ustekinumab: weighted hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-1.11; guselkumab: weighted HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22-1.02], while for those receiving adalimumab it was statistically significantly higher (weighted HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.22-2.18). Additionally, ustekinumab was associated with a reduced risk of PHN (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.64). There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of HZ between TSTs and either etanercept, secukinumab, ixekizumab or brodalumab. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ustekinumab and guselkumab may be associated with a reduced risk of HZ and PHN vs. TSTs in patients with psoriasis. This study could have significance for real-world practice.","Department of Dermatology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Dermatology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; International Center for Wound Repair and Regeneration, National Cheng Kung  University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,  College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Population Health Data Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.",8088345 [pii]; 10.1093/bjd/ljaf101 [doi],Lee CN; Hsieh MH; Chen CY; Yang CC; Liao TC; Lai EC,ORCID: 0000-0002-5852-7652,"© The Author(s) 2025.

It affects around 2% to 3% of people  globally. People with psoriasis can have itchy and painful raised patches on their skin. The development of drugs called ‘biologics’ has changed how we treat psoriasis. Some people taking biologics experience complete clearance of their psoriasis. Biologics work by suppressing the immune system. There are concerns about infections like ‘herpes zoster’ when taking biologics. Herpes zoster is also known as ‘shingles’. Shingles results when the virus that causes chickenpox reactivates. As well as skin infections, shingles can cause nerve pain. Other complications include specific eye and brain infections. Giving patients the shingles vaccine before they take biologics is important. We investigated the link between shingles and biologics in people with psoriasis. The biologics studied were ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab, etanercept and adalimumab. We used a national database in Taiwan to compare patients with psoriasis taking biologics to those on other treatment. The database covers 99% of Taiwan's population (approximately 23 million people). Patients on adalimumab were at higher risk of shingles than people on other treatment. People on ustekinumab or guselkumab were at less risk of shingles and nerve pain. Some biologics may lower the risk of shingles and nerve pain versus other treatments.

39848264,"BACKGROUND: New respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines have been approved in  the USA for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged 60 years and older. Information on the real-world effectiveness of these vaccines is needed. METHODS: We used electronic health records in the Veterans Health Administration to emulate a target trial comparing a single dose of a recombinant stabilised prefusion F protein RSV vaccine versus no vaccination among veterans aged 60 years and older. We matched eligible vaccine recipients with up to four unvaccinated individuals in four monthly nested sequential trials from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2023. Outcomes were ascertained up to March 31, 2024. The primary outcome was any positive RSV test from day 14 following the matched index date. Secondary outcomes included hospitalisation and emergency department or urgent care encounter occurring within 1 day before or after a positive RSV test. We estimated vaccine effectiveness as 100 × (1 - risk ratio). FINDINGS: We included 146 852 vaccinated individuals matched to 582 936 unique control individuals, weighted equally to represent 146 852 individuals. Across the two groups, 276 039 (94·0%) of 293 704 veterans were male, 17 665 (6·0%) were female, and median age was 75·9 years (IQR 71·7-79·7). Over a median follow-up of 124 days (IQR 102-150), the incidence rate of documented RSV infection was 1·7 (95% CI 1·4-2·1) events per 1000 person-years (88 total events) in the vaccinated group and 7·3 (6·6-8·1) per 1000 person-years in the unvaccinated group (372 total events), and vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 78·1% (72·6-83·5). Among the secondary outcomes, vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 78·7% (72·2-84·8) against RSV-associated emergency department or urgent care encounters, and 80·3% (65·8-90·1) against RSV-associated hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: RSV vaccination was effective in preventing RSV-related illness, including associated health-care use, in adults aged 60 years and older during the 2023-24 respiratory illness season, supporting current recommendations for vaccination in this population.

38950403,"BACKGROUND: Antidepressants are among the most commonly prescribed medications,  but evidence on comparative weight change for specific first-line treatments is limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare weight change across common first-line antidepressant treatments by emulating a target trial. DESIGN: Observational cohort study over 24 months. SETTING: Electronic health record (EHR) data from 2010 to 2019 across 8 U.S. health systems. PARTICIPANTS: 183 118 patients. MEASUREMENTS: Prescription data determined initiation of treatment with sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, duloxetine, or venlafaxine. The investigators estimated the population-level effects of initiating each treatment, relative to sertraline, on mean weight change (primary) and the probability of gaining at least 5% of baseline weight (secondary) 6 months after initiation. Inverse probability weighting of repeated outcome marginal structural models was used to account for baseline confounding and informative outcome measurement. In secondary analyses, the effects of initiating and adhering to each treatment protocol were estimated. RESULTS: Compared with that for sertraline, estimated 6-month weight gain was higher for escitalopram (difference, 0.41 kg [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52 kg]), paroxetine (difference, 0.37 kg [CI, 0.20 to 0.54 kg]), duloxetine (difference, 0.34 kg [CI, 0.22 to 0.44 kg]), venlafaxine (difference, 0.17 kg [CI, 0.03 to 0.31 kg]), and citalopram (difference, 0.12 kg [CI, 0.02 to 0.23 kg]); similar for fluoxetine (difference, -0.07 kg [CI, -0.19 to 0.04 kg]); and lower for bupropion (difference, -0.22 kg [CI, -0.33 to -0.12 kg]). Escitalopram, paroxetine, and duloxetine were associated with 10% to 15% higher risk for gaining at least 5% of baseline weight, whereas bupropion was associated with 15% reduced risk. When the effects of initiation and adherence were estimated, associations were stronger but had wider CIs. Six-month adherence ranged from 28% (duloxetine) to 41% (bupropion). LIMITATION: No data on medication dispensing, low medication adherence, incomplete data on adherence, and incomplete data on weight measures across time points. CONCLUSION: Small differences in mean weight change were found between 8 first-line antidepressants, with bupropion consistently showing the least weight gain, although adherence to medications over follow-up was low. Clinicians could consider potential weight gain when initiating antidepressant treatment.

37157869,"BACKGROUND: Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been associated  with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We investigated the impact of starting INSTI-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) on CVD events among treatment-naïve people with human immunodeficiency virus using a target trial framework, which reduces the potential for confounding and selection bias. METHODS: We included Swiss HIV Cohort Study participants who were ART-naïve after May 2008, when INSTIs became available in Switzerland. Individuals were categorized according to their first ART regimen (INSTI vs other ART) and were followed from ART start until the first of CVD event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or invasive cardiovascular procedure), loss to follow-up, death, or last cohort visit. We calculated hazard ratios and risk differences using pooled logistic regression models with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights. RESULTS: Of 5362 participants (median age 38 years, 21% women, 15% of African origin), 1837 (34.3%) started INSTI-based ART, and 3525 (65.7%) started other ART. Within 4.9 years (interquartile range, 2.4-7.4), 116 CVD events occurred. Starting INSTI-based ART was not associated with an increased risk for CVD events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], .46-1.39). Adjusted risk differences between individuals who started INSTIs and those who started other ART were -0.17% (95% CI, -.37 to .19) after 1 year, -0.61% (-1.54 to 0.22) after 5 years, and -0.71% (-2.16 to 0.94) after 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this target trial emulation, we found no difference in short- or long-term risk for CVD events between treatment-naïve people with human immunodeficiency virus who started INSTI-based ART and those on other ART.","Department of Infectious Diseases, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital,  University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Clinical Research, University  Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Division of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Lausanne, University of  Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Geneva University Hospital, University of  Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Chair Positive Council, Zurich, Switzerland.; Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital  Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Cantonal Hospital of St Gallen, St Gallen,  Switzerland.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale Lugano, University of  Geneva and University of Southern Switzerland, Lugano, Switzerland.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Cantonal Hospital of Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland.; Department of Medicine and Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital  Epidemiology, Kantonsspital Baselland, University of Basel, Bruderholz, Switzerland.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital  Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Institute of Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital,  University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital,  University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.",7157183 [pii]; ciad286 [pii]; 10.1093/cid/ciad286 [doi],Surial B; Chammartin F; Damas J; Calmy A; Haerry D; Stöckle M; Schmid P; Bernasconi E; Fux CA; Tarr PE; Günthard HF; Wandeler G; Rauch A,ORCID: 0000-0002-1402-974X,© The Author(s) 2023.

34641870,"BACKGROUND: An Informatics Consult has been proposed in which clinicians request  novel evidence from large scale health data resources, tailored to the treatment of a specific patient. However, the availability of such consultations is lacking. We seek to provide an Informatics Consult for a situation where a treatment indication and contraindication coexist in the same patient, i.e., anti-coagulation use for stroke prevention in a patient with both atrial fibrillation (AF) and liver cirrhosis. METHODS: We examined four sources of evidence for the effect of warfarin on stroke risk or all-cause mortality from: (1) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), (2) meta-analysis of prior observational studies, (3) trial emulation (using population electronic health records (N = 3,854,710) and (4) genetic evidence (Mendelian randomisation). We developed prototype forms to request an Informatics Consult and return of results in electronic health record systems. RESULTS: We found 0 RCT reports and 0 trials recruiting for patients with AF and cirrhosis. We found broad concordance across the three new sources of evidence we generated. Meta-analysis of prior observational studies showed that warfarin use was associated with lower stroke risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71, CI 0.39-1.29). In a target trial emulation, warfarin was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.61, CI 0.49-0.76) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 0.27, CI 0.08-0.91). Mendelian randomisation served as a drug target validation where we found that lower levels of vitamin K1 (warfarin is a vitamin K1 antagonist) are associated with lower stroke risk. A pilot survey with an independent sample of 34 clinicians revealed that 85% of clinicians found information on prognosis useful and that 79% thought that they should have access to the Informatics Consult as a service within their healthcare systems. We identified candidate steps for automation to scale evidence generation and to accelerate the return of results. CONCLUSION: We performed a proof-of-concept Informatics Consult for evidence generation, which may inform treatment decisions in situations where there is dearth of randomised trials. Patients are surprised to know that their clinicians are currently not able to learn in clinic from data on 'patients like me'. We identify the key challenges in offering such an Informatics Consult as a service.","Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.  alvina.lai@ucl.ac.uk.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK. alvina.lai@ucl.ac.uk.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.; University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.; The Alan Turing Institute, London, UK.; Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol,  Bristol, UK.; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol,  Bristol, UK.; Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol,  Bristol, UK.; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol,  Bristol, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; Institute of Applies Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.; Statistics and Bioinformatics Group, School of Fundamental Sciences, Massey  University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.; Public Health Wales, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.; Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University,  Utrecht, Netherlands.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK.; University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK.; Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge,  UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London,  London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK.; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol,  Bristol, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Barts Health NHS Trust, The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel Rd, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; University Hospitals Birmingham NHSFT, Birmingham, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; University Hospitals Birmingham NHSFT, Birmingham, UK.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.; NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA,  USA.; Barts Liver Centre, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London,  UK.; University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK.; University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.",10.1186/s12911-021-01638-z [pii]; 1638 [pii]; 10.1186/s12911-021-01638-z [doi],Lai AG; Chang WH; Parisinos CA; Katsoulis M; Blackburn RM; Shah AD; Nguyen V; Denaxas S; Davey Smith G; Gaunt TR; Nirantharakumar K; Cox MP; Forde D; Asselbergs FW; Harris S; Richardson S; Sofat R; Dobson RJB; Hingorani A; Patel R; Sterne J; Banerjee A; Denniston AK; Ball S; Sebire NJ; Shah NH; Foster GR; Williams B; Hemingway H,ORCID: 0000-0001-8960-8095,© 2021.

40349966,"OBJECTIVES: Real-world studies on its effectiveness in patients with type 2  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the live zoster vaccine in patients with T2DM more than 10 years. METHODS: In this target trial emulation study, we utilized a large-scale, nationwide cohort in South Korea, consisting of individuals aged 50 years and older with T2DM from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2021 (n = 934 945). This cohort was integrated using health insurance data from the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, national health screening results from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, and live zoster vaccination data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Vaccine effectiveness in preventing herpes zoster (HZ), postherpetic neuralgia, and hospital admissions for HZ based on International Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes was evaluated in patients with T2DM. In a propensity score-based overlap weighted cohort, Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs for the effectiveness of the live zoster vaccine among patients with T2DM. RESULTS: After propensity score-based overlap weighting, 253 660 patients with T2DM were included (mean age, 62.4 years [standard deviation, 2.3 years]; 138 338 males, 54.5%). Live zoster vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of HZ (aHR 0.59 [95% CI: 0.57-0.61]), postherpetic neuralgia (aHR 0.59 [95% CI: 0.57-0.61]), and hospital admissions for HZ (aHR 0.41 [95% CI: 0.36-0.47]). Vaccine effectiveness was highest within the first-year post-vaccination, with a sustained protective effect lasting up to 6 years. Furthermore, the effectiveness was greater in the non-insulin treatment group compared with the insulin treatment group. DISCUSSION: Our target trial highlighted that live zoster vaccination significantly reduced the risk of HZ, postherpetic neuralgia, and hospital admissions in patients with T2DM. However, its effectiveness was attenuated in those undergoing insulin treatment.","Department of Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South  Korea; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee  University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Regulatory Science, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South  Korea; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South  Korea; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee  University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Precision Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee  University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Regulatory Science, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee  University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Precision Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee  University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Precision Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South  Korea; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Regulatory Science, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Precision Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kyung Hee University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.; Centre for Health, Performance, and Wellbeing, Anglia Ruskin University,  Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Biruni University, Istanbul, Turkey.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

40208261,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been linked to the  development of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCCs). We investigated whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases the risk of selected PCCs or death up to 1 year after infection, separately in the wild-type (WT), Alpha-transition, Delta, and Omicron eras and by vaccination status. METHODS: We used health records of the Veterans Health Administration to emulate a hypothetical target trial of SARS-CoV-2 infection versus no infection. Veterans who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 2020 and April 2022 (n = 430 160) were matched 1:1 to veterans who had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of 32 potential PCCs were ascertained at 31-180 and 181-365 days after infection or matched index date. RESULTS: From 31 to 180 days, the cumulative incidence of death and all organ-level PCCs was greater in infected versus uninfected participants, with cumulative incidence differences lower in the Omicron than in the WT era and lower in vaccinated than in unvaccinated persons. In the Omicron era, the cumulative incidence of death and most PCCs from day 181-365 were higher in infected than in uninfected participants only among unvaccinated but not among vaccinated persons. CONCLUSIONS: Excess burden of PCCs and mortality persisted 31-180 days after infection in the Omicron era, albeit at a lower level than in the WT and Delta eras. Excess burden of mortality and most PCCs was much lower 181-365 days after infection and was observed in the Omicron era only among unvaccinated persons, suggesting a protective effect of vaccination.","Research and Development, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System,  Seattle, Washington, USA.;

39993818,"BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease  (CKD), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve renal outcomes, but may transiently affect biochemical markers of CKD-mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD). We sought to evaluate the long-term risk of CKD-MBD associated with use of SGLT2 inhibitors in this patient population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, employing a target trial emulation framework and using electronic medical records of patients from 9 hospitals in Taiwan (2016-2023). We included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1-3 CKD who had newly started either an SGLT2 inhibitor or, as a comparison group, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). The primary outcome was a composite of incident biochemical abnormalities (serum phosphate > 1.5 mmol/L, serum calcium < 2.1 mmol/L, serum intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] > 6.9 pmol/L, or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 49.9 nmol/L). RESULTS: The cohort included 13 379 patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 11 920) or GLP-1 RAs (n = 1459) with a median follow-up of 3.3 years. Compared with GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower cumulative incidence of the composite primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.86), hyperphosphatemia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.91), hypocalcemia (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.78-0.86), high serum iPTH levels (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.78), and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90). INTERPRETATION: Use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a lower incidence of biochemical abnormalities related to CKD-MBD than GLP-1 RAs. These agents may be considered to reduce risk of CKD-MBD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1-3 CKD.","School of Pharmacy (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Population Health Data Center (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine (Liu), and Division of Nephrology (Liu), Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacy (Shao), Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Population Health Data Center (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine (Liu), and Division of Nephrology (Liu), Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacy (Shao), Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Population Health Data Center (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine (Liu), and Division of Nephrology (Liu), Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacy (Shao), Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Population Health Data Center (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine (Liu), and Division of Nephrology (Liu), Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacy (Shao), Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan. scshao@cgmh.org.tw.; School of Pharmacy (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Population Health Data Center (Tsai, Chuang, Shao, Lai), National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine (Liu), and Division of Nephrology (Liu), Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacy (Shao), Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.",197/7/E178 [pii]; 197e178 [pii]; 10.1503/cmaj.240922 [doi],Tsai DH; Chuang AT; Liu KH; Shao SC; Lai EC,,© 2025 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors.,,,Competing interests:: None declared.,,2025/02/24 20:43,20250509,20250223,2025 Feb 23,2025/02/25 00:22,,,"Tsai, Daniel Hsiang-Te; Chuang, Albert Tzu-Ming; Liu, Kuan-Hung; Shao, Shih-Chieh; Lai, Edward Chia-Cheng",,,7,,1488-2329,0820-3946,0820-3946,9711805,CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale  canadienne,eng,10.1503/cmaj.240922 [doi],20250522,"Humans; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/complications; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/therapeutic use/adverse effects; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; *Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/epidemiology; Aged; Taiwan/epidemiology; *Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder/epidemiology/chemically induced; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists; Incidence; Risk Factors",2025/02/25 00:23,,,,,,NLM,E178-E189,2025/01/21 00:00,2025/02/24 20:43,2025/02/25 00:23,,2025/02/24 00:00,2025/02/25 00:22,,Canada,PMC11867598,2025/02/24,epublish,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors); 0 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists),IM,,CMAJ. 2025 Feb 23;197(7):E178-E189. doi: 10.1503/cmaj.240922.,MEDLINE,CMAJ,Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and risk of chronic kidney  disease-mineral and bone disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease.,,,,197
38619822,"IMPORTANCE: Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a  revolutionary treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with cardiovascular, kidney, and serum urate-lowering benefits. OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of incident gout and rate of recurrent flares between patients with T2D initiating SGLT2i vs sulfonylurea, most common second-line glucose-lowering therapy, when added to metformin monotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This sequential, propensity score-matched, new-user comparative effectiveness study using target trial emulation framework included adults with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy in a Canadian general population database from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2022. EXPOSURES: Initiation of SGLT2i vs sulfonylurea. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was incident gout diagnosis, ascertained by emergency department (ED), hospital, outpatient, and medication dispensing records. Secondary outcomes were gout-primary hospitalizations and ED visits and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), as well as recurrent flare rates among prevalent gout patients. Heart failure (HF) hospitalization was assessed as positive control outcome and osteoarthritis encounters as negative control. For target trial emulations, we used Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regressions with 1:1 propensity score matching (primary analysis) and overlap weighting (sensitivity analysis). The analysis was conducted from September to December, 2023. RESULTS: Among 34 604 propensity score matched adults with T2D initiating SGLT2i or sulfonylurea (20 816 [60%] male, mean [SD] age, 60 [12.4] years), incidence of gout was lower among SGLT2i initiators (4.27 events per 1000 person-years) than sulfonylurea initiators (6.91 events per 1000 person-years), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.48-0.80) and a rate difference (RD) of -2.64 (95% CI, -3.99 to -1.29) per 1000 person-years. Associations persisted regardless of sex, age, or baseline diuretic use. SGLT2i use was also associated with fewer recurrent flares among gout patients (rate ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.82; and RD, -20.9; 95% CI, -31.9 to -10.0 per 1000 person-years). HR and RD for MACE associated with SGLT2i use were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77-0.98) and -3.58 (95% CI, -6.19 to -0.96) per 1000 person-years. For control outcomes, SGLT2i users had lower risk of HF (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.76), as expected, with no difference in osteoarthritis (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.94-1.34). Results were similar when applying propensity score overlap weighting. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based cohort study, the gout and cardiovascular benefits associated with SGLT2i in these target trial emulations may guide selection of glucose-lowering therapy in patients with T2D, at risk for or already with gout.","Rheumatology & Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Division of  Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; The Mongan Institute, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Rheumatology & Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Division of  Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; The Mongan Institute, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Diabetes Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British  Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of British Columbia,  Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine,  University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore.; University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing, Bethesda.; Division of Gerontology, Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of  Medicine, Baltimore.; Rheumatology & Allergy Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Division of  Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; The Mongan Institute, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",2817607 [pii]; ioi240011 [pii]; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.0376 [doi],McCormick N; Yokose C; Lu N; Wexler DJ; Aviña-Zubieta JA; De Vera MA; McCoy RG; Choi HK,,,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr McCormick reported grants from the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) (K99-AR080243 Career Development Award) during the conduct of the study.

39206550,"BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin have proven cardiovascular benefits  in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, but their comparative effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: This study used nationwide, population-based Danish health registries to emulate a hypothetical target trial comparing empagliflozin versus dapagliflozin initiation, in addition to standard care, among people with treated type 2 diabetes from 2014 through 2020. The outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure (HF), or cardiovascular death (major adverse cardiovascular event). Participants were followed until an outcome, emigration, or death occurred; 6 years after initiation; or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first. Logistic regression was used to compute inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights, controlling for 57 potential confounders. In intention-to-treat analyses, 6-year adjusted risks, risk differences, and risk ratios, considering noncardiovascular death competing events, were estimated. Analyses were stratified by coexisting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and HF. A per-protocol design was performed as a secondary analysis. RESULTS: There were 36 670 eligible empagliflozin and 20 606 eligible dapagliflozin initiators. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the adjusted 6-year absolute risk of major adverse cardiovascular event was not different between empagliflozin and dapagliflozin initiators (10.0% versus 10.0%; risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -0.9% to 1.0%]; risk ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.11]). The findings were consistent in people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (risk difference, -2.3% [95% CI, -8.2% to 3.5%]; risk ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.14]) and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (risk difference, 0.3% [95% CI, -0.6% to 1.2%]; risk ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.16]) and in people with HF (risk difference, 1.1% [95% CI, -6.5% to 8.6%]; risk ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.37]) and without HF (risk difference, -0.1% [95% CI, -1.0% to 0.8%]; risk ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.09]). The 6-year risks of major adverse cardiovascular event were also not different in the per-protocol analysis (9.1% versus 8.8%; risk difference, 0.2% [95% CI, -2.1% to 2.5%]; risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.32]). CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin initiators had no differences in 6-year cardiovascular outcomes in adults with treated type 2 diabetes with or without coexisting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or HF.","Departments of Clinical Epidemiology (K.B., U.H.-J., D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.),  Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark (K.B., U.H.-J.,  D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.).; Departments of Clinical Epidemiology (K.B., U.H.-J., D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.),  Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark (K.B., U.H.-J.,  D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.).; Departments of Clinical Epidemiology (K.B., U.H.-J., D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.),  Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.; Endocrinology and Internal Medicine (D.H.C.), Aarhus University Hospital,  Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark (K.B., U.H.-J.,  D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.).; Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, GA  (T.L.L.).; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of  Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, PA (S.H.).; Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,  Sweden (A.M.).; Departments of Clinical Epidemiology (K.B., U.H.-J., D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.),  Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark (K.B., U.H.-J.,  D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.).; Departments of Clinical Epidemiology (K.B., U.H.-J., D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.),  Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark (K.B., U.H.-J.,  D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.).; Departments of Clinical Epidemiology (K.B., U.H.-J., D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.),  Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark (K.B., U.H.-J.,  D.H.C., L.P., R.W.T., M.S.).; Department of Cardiology, Gødstrup Regional Hospital, Denmark (M.S.).",10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.068613 [doi],Bonnesen K; Heide-Jørgensen U; Christensen DH; Lash TL; Hennessy S; Matthews A; Pedersen L; Thomsen RW; Schmidt M,ORCID: 0000-0002-8626-2372; ORCID: 0000-0002-8407-4618; ORCID: 0000-0002-2693-5651; ORCID: 0000-0003-4726-9413; ORCID: 0000-0002-1290-271X; ORCID: 0000-0002-9341-3888; ORCID: 0000-0001-9135-3474; ORCID: 0000-0002-4935-4059,,Circulation. 2024 Oct 29;150(18):1412-1415. doi:  10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069220.

39004436,"OBJECTIVES: Older individuals with multimorbidity are at an elevated risk of  infection and complications from COVID-19. Effectiveness of post-COVID-19 interventions or care models in reducing subsequent adverse outcomes in these individuals have rarely been examined. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of attending general outpatient within 30 days after discharge from COVID-19 on 1-year survival among older adults aged 85 years or above with multimorbidity. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study emulating a randomised target trial using electronic health records. SETTING: We used data from the Hospital Authority and the Department of Health in Hong Kong, which provided comprehensive electronic health records, COVID-19 confirmed case data, population-based vaccination records and other individual characteristics for the study. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 85 years or above with multimorbidity who were discharged after hospitalisation for COVID-19 between January 2020 and August 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Attending a general outpatient within 30 days of last COVID-19 discharge defined the exposure, compared to no outpatient visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality within one year. Secondary outcomes included mortality from respiratory, cardiovascular and cancer causes. RESULTS: A total of 6183 eligible COVID-19 survivors were included in the analysis. The all-cause mortality rate following COVID-19 hospitalisation was lower in the general outpatient visit group (17.1 deaths per 100 person-year) compared with non-visit group (42.8 deaths per 100 person-year). After adjustment, primary care consultations within 30 days after discharge were associated with a significantly greater 1-year survival (difference in 1-year survival: 11.2%, 95% CI 8.1% to 14.4%). We also observed significantly better survival from respiratory diseases in the general outpatient visit group (difference in 1-year survival: 6.3%, 95% CI 3.5% to 8.9%). In a sensitivity analysis for different grace period lengths, we found that the earlier participants had a general outpatient visit after COVID-19 discharge, the better the survival. CONCLUSIONS: Timely primary care consultations after COVID-19 hospitalisation may improve survival following COVID-19 hospitalisation among older adults aged 85 or above with multimorbidity.

40340843,"BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (ECPR) are at risk of left ventricular distention and complications. There is emerging evidence that concurrent mechanical left ventricular (LV) unloading (e.g. an intra-aortic balloon pump, or microaxial left ventricular assist device) may improve survival. Despite this, there are no large, well-conducted studies investigating the impact of LV unloading on outcomes in ECPR. METHODS: We queried the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) registry between 2020 and 2023, and used an emulated target trial framework to investigate the association between concurrent mechanical left ventricular unloading and outcomes in patients receiving ECPR. We imputed missing data using multiple imputation with chained equations, and identified potential confounders implicated in the causal pathway between ECPR and survival time up to 90 days (primary outcome). We used propensity score-matching to adjust for potential confounders, and analysed the primary outcome using a Cox proportional hazards model. We then emulated further target trials based on the inclusion criteria of prior ECPR RCTs to assess whether concurrent unloading was associated with better outcomes based on these criteria. Secondary outcomes included complications from ECPR as classified by ELSO, and survival with favourable functional outcome defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2. RESULTS: Of the 3,215 patients included in our analysis, we matched 621 pairs of patients who did and did not receive LV unloading. There were no significant differences in survival time between both groups (HR 0.92, 95%-CI 0.79-1.08), nor survival with favourable functional outcomes (OR 1.15, 95%-CI 0.67-1.99). This was concordant across several sensitivity analyses. Of note, LV unloading was associated with a higher rate of renal (OR 1.55, 95%-CI 1.16-2.07) and cardiovascular (OR 1.60, 95%-CI 1.14-2.26) complications. LV unloading was also associated with central nervous system bleeding (OR 1.75, 95%-CI 1.03-2.96), arrhythmias (OR 1.56, 95%-CI 1.04-2.36), and haemolysis (OR 1.85, 95%-CI 1.10-3.09). CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular unloading was not associated with improved survival in the context of ECPR and may increase complication rates. Randomised data are required to confirm these findings.","Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National  University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.; Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre, School of Public Health  and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, QLD, Australia.; Department of Anaesthesia, National University Hospital, National University  Health System, Singapore, Singapore.; Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research  (A*STaR), Singapore, Singapore.; Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National  University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.; Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University of  Physicians and Surgeons/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Korea University Anam  Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National  University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.; Department of Cardiology, National University Heart Centre Singapore, National  University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.; Pre-Hospital and Emergency Research Centre, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore,  Singapore.; Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Department, Heart & Vascular Centre, Maastricht  University Medical Centre, Maastricht, The Netherlands.; Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands.; Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg,  Germany.; Health Services and Systems Research, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore,  Singapore.; Preventive Services, Graduate School of Medicine, School of Public Health, Kyoto  University, Kyoto, Japan.; Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Utah  Health, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT,  USA.; Adult Intensive Care Services, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, QLD,  Australia.; Faculty of Health Sciences & Medicine, Bond University, Gold Coast, QLD,  Australia.; Faculty of Health, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore,  MD, USA.; Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National  University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.; Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, National University Heart Centre, National  University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.; Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National  University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. surrkr@nus.edu.sg.; Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, National University Heart Centre, National  University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. surrkr@nus.edu.sg.",10.1186/s13054-025-05345-3 [pii]; 5345 [pii]; 10.1186/s13054-025-05345-3 [doi],Ling RR; Chen Y; Low CJW; Agerstrand C; Jung JS; Lim SL; Lorusso R; Müeller T; Okada Y; Tonna JE; Shekar K; Brodie D; MacLaren G; Ramanathan K,,© 2025.

36215715,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of a third mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (booster  dose) against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is uncertain, especially in older, high-risk populations. OBJECTIVE: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death in the Omicron era by booster type, primary vaccine type, time since primary vaccination, age, and comorbidity burden. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study designed to emulate a target trial of booster vaccination versus no booster, conducted from 1 December 2021 to 31 March 2022. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who had received 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier. INTERVENTION: Booster monovalent mRNA vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 or Moderna's mRNA-1273) versus no booster. MEASUREMENTS: Booster VE. RESULTS: Each group included 490 838 well-matched persons, who were predominantly male (88%), had a mean age of 63.0 years (SD, 14.0), and were followed for up to 121 days (mean, 79.8 days). Booster VE more than 10 days after a booster dose was 42.3% (95% CI, 40.6% to 43.9%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3% (CI, 48.1% to 58.0%) against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization, and 79.1% (CI, 71.2% to 84.9%) against SARS-CoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups, and primary vaccination regimens but was significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and higher comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly male population. CONCLUSION: Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after administration in the Omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

38242680,"BACKGROUND: To mimic as closely as possible a randomised controlled trial (RCT)  and calibrate the real-world evidence (RWE) studies against a known treatment effect would be helpful to understand if RWE can support causal conclusions in selected circumstances. The aim was to emulate the TRANSFORMS trial comparing Fingolimod (FTY) versus intramuscular interferon β-1a (IFN) using observational data. METHODS: We extracted from the MSBase registry all the patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) collected in the period 2011-2021 who received IFN or FTY (0.5 mg) and with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria of the TRANSFORMS RCT. The primary endpoint was the annualised relapse rate (ARR) over 12 months. Patients were 1:1 propensity-score (PS) matched. Relapse-rate ratio (RR) was calculated by mean of a negative binomial regression. RESULTS: A total of 4376 patients with RRMS (1140 in IFN and 3236 in FTY) were selected. After PS, 856 patients in each group were matched. The ARR was 0.45 in IFN and 0.25 in FTY with a significant difference between the two groups (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.68; p<0.001). The result of the emulation was very similar and fell within the 95% CI of that observed in the RCT (RR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.64; p<0.001) with a standardised difference of 0.66 (p=0.51). CONCLUSIONS: By applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the RCT and employing appropriate methodology, we successfully replicated the RCT results with only minor discrepancies. Also, even if the confounding bias cannot be fully eliminated, conducting a rigorous target trial emulation could still yield valuable insights for comparative effectiveness research.","Department of Health Sciences, Section of Biostatistics, University of Genova,  Genoa, Italy alessio.signori@medicina.unige.it.; Department of Health Sciences, Section of Biostatistics, University of Genova,  Genoa, Italy.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Neurology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria,  Australia.; Dokuz Eylul University, İzmir, Turkey.; Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Charles University  in Prague, 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Charles University  in Prague, 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.; Amiri Hospital, Kuwait City, Kuwait.; Department of Neuroscience, University of Catania Department of Surgical and  Medical Sciences and Advanced Technologies 'G.F.

40668838,"BACKGROUND: Special educational needs (SEN) provision is designed to help pupils  with additional educational, behavioural or health needs. Our aim was to assess the impact of early SEN provision on health and educational outcomes for a well-defined population, pupils with cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CLP) without additional anomalies. METHODS: We used the ECHILD database, which links educational and health records across England. Our target population consisted of children with a recorded diagnosis of CLP without other major congenital anomalies in hospital admission records in ECHILD. We applied a trial emulation framework to define eligibility into our study and investigate the causal impact of SEN provision in the first year of compulsory school (Year 1 - age five/six years) on various health and educational outcomes accumulated by the end of primary education (Year 6 - age ten/eleven years). SEN provision was categorised as: None, SEN Support, and Education and Health Care Plan (EHCP). The outcomes were: unplanned hospital utilisation, medical and unauthorised school absences, persistent absences, and standardised key stage 1 (KS1) and key stage 2 (KS2) mathematics attainment scores. To account for confounding factors affecting the observed associations and estimate the causal effects of early SEN provision on these outcomes, we used three estimating approaches: propensity score-based methods (inverse probability weighting, [IPW]), g-computation, and augmented IPW (AIPW). Causal effects were measured in terms of average treatment effects (ATE) and average treatment effects on the treated (ATT), expressed as rate ratios (RaR) for hospitalisations and absences, risk ratios (RiR) for persistent absences, and mean differences (Δ) for academic scores. Missing values of the confounders were handled via the missing covariate indicator method. We triangulated these results with those obtained by univariable and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Our study included 6,601 children with CLP and without additional major congenital anomalies. Evaluations involving EHCP were limited by the low numbers of comparative children. Thus, only comparisons of SEN Support (N = 2,009, 31.6%) versus None (N = 4,350, 68.4%) are reported. Observed rates of unplanned hospitalisation (RaRcrude = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12, 1.52), persistent absence (RiRcrude = 2.21 (1.87, 2.62)) and medical absence (RaRcrude = 1.34 (1.28, 1.40)) were higher amongst children with recorded SEN support, whilst KS1 and KS2 maths scores were lower (Δ crude = -0.85 (-0.90, -0.79) and Δ crude = -0.82 (-0.89, -0.75), respectively). Contrary to the observed relative rates and risks, we found small or no evidence of a causal effect of SEN Support on unplanned hospitalisation (ATE: RaRIPW = 1.16 (1.00, 1.34), RaRg = 0.99 (0.87, 1.12); RaRIAPW = 1.02 (0.87, 1.17) or persistent absences (ATE: RiRIPW = 1.13 (0.92, 1.34); RiRg = 1.08 (0.86, 1.31); RiRAIPW = 1.20 (0.96, 1.45)). We found that SEN support increased rates of medical absences (ATE: RaRIPW = 1.10 (1.04, 1.18); RaRg = 1.09 (1.03, 1.15); RaRAIPW = 1.04 (0.95, 1.13)), decreased those of unauthorised absences (RaRIPW = 0.86 (0.76, 0.97); RaRg = 0.98 (0.86, 1.09); RaRAIPW = 0.80 (0.66, 0.95)) and decreased - but not as extensively as the crude differences suggested- KS1 (ATE: Δ IPW = -0.18 (-0.25, -0.10); Δ g = -0.21 (-0.26, -0.16); Δ AIPW = -0.25 (-0.32, -0.17)) and KS2 maths scores (ATE: Δ IPW = -0.24 (-0.33, -0.15); Δ g = -0.27 (-0.33, -0.21); Δ AIPW = -0.24 (-0.32, -0.17)). Results for the ATT for each of these outcomes were similar to those for the ATE, indicating no observable evidence of heterogeneity of effects by treatment received. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results. DISCUSSION: In the population of children with CLP without further major congenital anomalies, assignment to receive or not receiving early SEN Support appears to have no harmful impact on the rates of unplanned hospitalisation or persistent absences, but to increase rates of medical absences, whilst reducing rates of unauthorised absences. For the sub-populations of children with key stage results, such hypothetical intervention does not appear to completely reduce the observed disadvantage in KS1 and KS2 mathematics scores. These results relate to the impact of the intention to intervene not the actual delivery of actual SEN Support provision as this information is not available in school administrative records. Furthermore, we cannot discount the impact of unaccounted confounding factors, such as parental education and early home learning environments, particularly for the education attainment results.","University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London,  United Kingdom.; University College London Institute of Health Informatics, London, United  Kingdom.; University College London Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, London,  United Kingdom.; University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London,  United Kingdom.; University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London,  United Kingdom.; University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London,  United Kingdom.; University College London Social Research Institute, London, United Kingdom.",PONE-D-25-00324 [pii]; 10.1371/journal.pone.0327720 [doi],Nguyen V; Lewis K; Gilbert R; De Stavola B; Dearden L,ORCID: 0000-0002-9776-6242; ORCID: 0000-0003-1148-1017,"Copyright: © 2025 Nguyen et al.

40577672,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research of associations between statins and  Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease-related dementias (AD/ADRDs) has been limited by short follow-up, small samples, and confounding. We aimed to estimate the association between the 1st statin prescription and incident AD/ADRD among members of a large population-based cohort of older adults. METHODS: We used a cohort study design emulating a target trial using data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care delivery system. Participants were born before 1951 and KPNC members for 4+ years during 1997-2010. Embedded subsamples included sociodemographic and genetic data. Statin initiators were matched at first prescription (""baseline"") with up to 5 ""noninitiators"" based on age and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Participants with extreme propensity scores were excluded. The outcome was time to incident AD/ADRD diagnosis, censoring, or the administrative end of study (December 31, 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios for statin initiation on AD/ADRD incidence. Follow-up time was divided at the first year of follow-up to account for increased AD/ADRD detection in the first year due to increased interaction with the health care system after a statin prescription. RESULTS: Among eligible participants (n = 705,061), 264,294 individuals (37.5% of eligible participants) initiated any statin during 2001-2010 (""initiators""), of whom 249,613 (94.4%) were matched with 255,937 unique noninitiators to create the analytic sample (322,358 unique participants; mean age at baseline = 67.4 years; 55.1% female). The average follow-up was 11.8 years. In the first year after initiating statins, AD/ADRD diagnoses were elevated by 46% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.46, 95% CI 1.42-1.53) compared with noninitiators. After 1 year, statin initiators experienced no difference in AD/ADRD incidence (full sample: HR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.01; subsample with survey covariates: HR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.06; subsample with survey and genetic covariates: HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.91-1.07). Adjustment for sociodemographic covariates and apolipoprotein E e4 allele count did not materially change the findings. DISCUSSION: In this large emulated target trial, statin initiation was inconsistent with more than a 3% increase or decrease in the hazard of AD/ADRD after the first year of follow-up. This intent-to-treat analysis does not directly quantify effects of long-term exposure to statins. Associations in the first year likely reflect increased medical observation immediately after statin initiation. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This emulated trial provides Class II evidence that statin initiation is not associated with AD/ADRD or AD incidence after the first year of follow-up.","Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, MA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San  Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, MA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San  Francisco.; Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Pleasanton, CA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San  Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San  Francisco.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center, VA Boston  Healthcare System.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of California San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San  Francisco.; Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Pleasanton, CA.; Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Pleasanton, CA.; Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Pleasanton, CA.; Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Pleasanton, CA.; Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis; and.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San  Francisco.; Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Pleasanton, CA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco.; Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, University of California San Francisco.; Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Pleasanton, CA.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, MA.",WNL-2024-106810 [pii]; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000213855 [doi],Zimmerman SC; Choi M; Jiang C; Ferguson EL; Hoffmann TJ; Swinnerton K; Oni-Orisan A; Gilsanz P; Meyers TJ; Choudhary V; Whitmer RA; Risch N; Krauss RM; Schaefer CA; Glymour MM,ORCID: 0000-0002-4431-6520; ORCID: 0009-0000-6658-5054; ORCID: 0000-0002-0336-4518; ORCID: 0000-0003-3136-0001; ORCID: 0000-0001-6893-4449; ORCID: 0000-0002-7429-9960; ORCID: 0000-0002-5897-5543; ORCID: 0000-0002-7635-381X; ORCID: 0000-0001-9186-9745; ORCID: 0009-0009-4720-9518; ORCID: 0009-0006-9511-6138; ORCID: 0000-0002-4126-2061; ORCID: 0000-0002-4172-6815; ORCID: 0000-0003-2644-055X; ORCID: 0000-0001-9644-3081,,,,"S.

39438867,"BACKGROUND: Patients with low-to-normal body mass index (BMI; < 25.0 kg/m(2))  were underrepresented in major randomized controlled trials on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes. The present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes and low-to-normal BMI, using finer stratification than previous trials. METHODS: This cohort study with a target trial emulation framework was conducted using insurance claims and health screening records of more than 30 million working-age citizens in Japan acquired from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2022. 139,783 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors matched to 139,783 users of dipeptidyl protease (DPP) 4 inhibitors with stratification by BMI category (< 20.0, 20.0-22.4, 22.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and 35.0 ≤ kg/m(2)). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure. Secondary outcomes were the components of the primary outcome. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare SGLT2 inhibitors with DPP4 inhibitors in the whole population and subgroups defined by the BMI category. RESULTS: Among participants, 17.3% (n = 48,377) were female and 31.0% (n = 86,536) had low-to-normal BMI (< 20.0 kg/m(2), 1.9% [n = 5,350]; 20.0-22.4 kg/m(2), 8.5% [n = 23,818]; and 22.5-24.9 kg/m(2), 20.5% [n = 57,368]). Over a median follow-up of 24 months, the primary outcome occurred in 2.9% (n = 8,165) of participants. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a decreased incidence of the primary outcome in the whole population (HR [95%CI] = 0.92 [0.89 to 0.96]), but not in patients with low-to-normal BMI (< 20.0 kg/m(2), HR [95%CI] = 1.08 [0.80 to 1.46]; 20.0-22.4 kg/m(2), HR [95%CI] = 1.04 [0.90 to 1.20]; and 22.5-24.9 kg/m(2), HR [95%CI] = 0.92 [0.84 to 1.01]). CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular events among patients with type 2 diabetes appeared to decrease with lower BMI and was not significant among patients with low-to-normal BMI (< 25.0 kg/m2). These findings suggest the importance of considering BMI when initiating SGLT2 inhibitors.","Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto  University, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston,  MA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

39431397,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were excluded from  sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) clinical trials. It is unknown whether the cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2i extend to patients with SLE and comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: We performed an emulated clinical trial in an insurance-based cohort in the United States, evaluating SGLT2i versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) for primary prevention of cardiovascular, renal, and other clinical outcomes among patients with both SLE and comorbid T2D. SGLT2i initiators were matched to DPP4i initiators using propensity scores (PSs) based on clinical and demographic factors. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox models. RESULTS: Outcomes among 2,165 patients starting SGLT2i and 2,165 PS-matched patients starting DPP4i were compared. Over 753.1 (±479.2) mean days, SGLT2i recipients had significantly lower risks of incident acute kidney injury (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39-0.63), chronic kidney disease (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50-0.76), end-stage renal disease (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.80), heart failure (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.92), emergency department visits (HR 0.90, 0.82-0.99), and severe sepsis (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.94). Risks of all-cause mortality (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65-1.21), lupus nephritis (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.38-1.15), myocardial infarction (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54-1.23), stroke (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.74-1.44), and hospitalizations (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.12) did not differ. Genital infection risk (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.61) was increased, but urinary tract infection risk (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.03) did not differ. No significant difference was observed for diabetic ketoacidosis risk (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.53-2.14) and fractures (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66-1.36). CONCLUSION: In this emulated clinical trial, treatment with SGLT2i, compared to DPP4i therapy, was associated with significantly reduced risks of several cardiorenal complications among patients with both SLE and T2D.","Center for Global Health, Perelman School of Medicine, University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.; Center for Global Health, Perelman School of Medicine, University of  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.; Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Beth  Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Beth  Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.",10.1002/art.43037 [doi],Ma KS; Lo JE; Kyttaris VC; Tsokos GC; Costenbader KH,ORCID: 0000-0002-9394-4144; ORCID: 0000-0003-2572-0111; ORCID: 0000-0001-7652-3826; ORCID: 0000-0001-9589-2360; ORCID: 0000-0002-8972-9388,© 2024 American College of Rheumatology.,,,,,2024/10/21 06:20,20250424,20241205,2025 Apr,2024/10/21 16:17,,,"Ma, Kevin Sheng-Kai; Lo, Jui-En; Kyttaris, Vasileios C; Tsokos, George C; Costenbader, Karen H",,K24 AR066109/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States,4,,2326-5205,2326-5191,,101623795,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",eng,10.1002/art.43037 [doi],20250719,"Humans; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/epidemiology/complications; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Female; Male; Middle Aged; *Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control/epidemiology; *Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Adult; *Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/epidemiology/complications/drug therapy; Primary Prevention/methods; Comorbidity; Treatment Outcome; Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/prevention & control/epidemiology; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Myocardial Infarction/epidemiology; Proportional Hazards Models; United States/epidemiology",2025/03/27 05:26,,,,,,NLM,414-422,2024/09/26 00:00,2024/10/21 06:20,2025/03/27 05:26,2024/08/12 00:00 [revised],,2024/10/21 16:17,2024/03/21 00:00,United States,,,ppublish,Journal Article,0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors); 0 (Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors),IM,,Arthritis Rheumatol. 2025 Apr;77(4):414-422. doi: 10.1002/art.43037.

39542851,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate whether adding oral  glucocorticoids to immunosuppressive therapy improves skin scores and ensures safety in patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc). METHODS: We performed an emulated randomized trial comparing the changes from baseline to 12 ± 3 months of the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS: primary outcome) in patients with early dcSSc receiving either oral glucocorticoids (≤20 mg/day prednisone equivalent) combined with immunosuppression (treated) or immunosuppression alone (controls), using data from the European Scleroderma Trials and Research Group. Secondary end points were the difference occurrence of progressive skin or lung fibrosis and scleroderma renal crisis. Matching propensity score was used to adjust for baseline imbalance between groups. RESULTS: We matched 208 patients (mean age 49 years; 33% male; 59% anti-Scl70), 104 in each treatment group, obtaining comparable characteristics at baseline. In the treated group, patients received a median prednisone dose of 5 mg/day. Mean mRSS change at 12 ± 3 months was similar in the two groups (decrease of 2.7 [95% confidence interval {95% CI} 1.4-4.0] in treated vs 3.1 [95% CI 1.9-4.4] in control, P = 0.64). Similar results were observed in patients with shorter disease duration (≤ 24 months) or with mRSS ≤22. There was no between-group difference for all prespecified secondary outcomes. A case of scleroderma renal crisis occurred in both groups. CONCLUSION: We did not find any significant benefit of adding low-dose oral glucocorticoids to immunosuppression for skin fibrosis, and at this dosage, glucocorticoid did not increase the risk of scleroderma renal crisis.","Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.; IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, and  Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.; University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; University, Prague, Czech Republic.; Charité University Hospital, Berlin, Germany.; V.A.

37382956,"IMPORTANCE: There is a need for observational studies to supplement evidence from  clinical trials, and the target trial emulation (TTE) framework can help avoid biases that can be introduced when treatments are compared crudely using observational data by applying design principles for randomized clinical trials. Adalimumab (ADA) and tofacitinib (TOF) were shown to be equivalent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a randomized clinical trial, but to our knowledge, these drugs have not been compared head-to-head using routinely collected clinical data and the TTE framework. OBJECTIVE: To emulate a randomized clinical trial comparing ADA vs TOF in patients with RA who were new users of a biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study emulating a randomized clinical trial of ADA vs TOF included Australian adults aged 18 years or older with RA in the Optimising Patient Outcomes in Australian Rheumatology (OPAL) data set. Patients were included if they initiated ADA or TOF between October 1, 2015, and April 1, 2021; were new b/tsDMARD users; and had at least 1 component of the disease activity score in 28 joints using C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) recorded at baseline or during follow-up. INTERVENTION: Treatment with either ADA (40 mg every 14 days) or TOF (10 mg daily). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the estimated average treatment effect, defined as the difference in mean DAS28-CRP among patients receiving TOF compared with those receiving ADA at 3 and 9 months after initiating treatment. Missing DAS28-CRP data were multiply imputed. Stable balancing weights were used to account for nonrandomized treatment assignment. RESULTS: A total of 842 patients were identified, including 569 treated with ADA (387 [68.0%] female; median age, 56 years [IQR, 47-66 years]) and 273 treated with TOF (201 [73.6%] female; median age, 59 years [IQR, 51-68 years]). After applying stable balancing weights, mean DAS28-CRP in the ADA group was 5.3 (95% CI, 5.2-5.4) at baseline, 2.6 (95% CI, 2.5-2.7) at 3 months, and 2.3 (95% CI, 2.2-2.4) at 9 months; in the TOF group, it was 5.3 (95% CI, 5.2-5.4) at baseline, 2.4 (95% CI, 2.2-2.5) at 3 months, and 2.3 (95% CI, 2.1-2.4) at 9 months. The estimated average treatment effect was -0.2 (95% CI, -0.4 to -0.03; P = .02) at 3 months and -0.03 (95% CI, -0.2 to 0.1; P = .60) at 9 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, there was a modest but statistically significant reduction in DAS28-CRP at 3 months for patients receiving TOF compared with those receiving ADA and no difference between treatment groups at 9 months. Three months of treatment with either drug led to clinically relevant average reductions in mean DAS28-CRP, consistent with remission.","OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology Versus Arthritis at University College London,  University College London Hospitals, Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London, London, United Kingdom.; National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Centre at Great Ormond Street  Hospital, London, United Kingdom.; Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, UCL Great  Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Department of Medicine, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Barwon Rheumatology Service, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Georgetown Arthritis, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; University of New South Wales, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia.; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Software for Specialists Pty Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Software for Specialists Pty Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Software for Specialists Pty Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.",2806589 [pii]; zoi230618 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.20851 [doi],Deakin CT; De Stavola BL; Littlejohn G; Griffiths H; Ciciriello S; Youssef P; Mathers D; Bird P; Smith T; O'Sullivan C; Freeman T; Segelov D; Hoffman D; Seaman SR,,,,OPAL Rheumatology Network,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Griffiths reported serving on the advisory  board for AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Organon, and Amgen.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the US Veterans Affairs (VA) and included 186 veterans who had COVID-19 between October 2020 and April 2021 (ie, COVID-19 cohort) and 186 matched comparators who did not have documented COVID-19 infections (ie, control cohort). This match balanced the risk of COVID-19 based on 39 variables measured in the 24 months before infection or match, using principles of target trial emulation. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to December 2023. EXPOSURE: First documented COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The differences in self-reported everyday functioning 18 months after COVID-19 infection were estimated and compared with their matched comparators. Within-matched pair logistic and linear regressions assessed differences in outcomes and were weighted to account for sampling and nonresponse. RESULTS: Among the 186 matched pairs of participants, their weighted mean age was 60.4 (95% CI, 57.5 to 63.2) years among veterans in the COVID-19 cohort (weighted sample, 91 459 of 101 133 [90.4%] male; 30 611 [30.3%] Black or African American veterans; 65 196 [64.4%] White veterans) and 61.1 (95% CI, 57.8 to 64.4) years among their comparators in the control cohort (91 459 [90.4%] male; 24 576 [24.3%] Black or African American veterans; 70 157 [69.4%] White veterans). A high proportion of veterans in the COVID-19 cohort (weighted percentage, 44.9% [95% CI, 34.2% to 56.2%]) reported that they could do less than what they felt they could do at the beginning of 2020 compared with the control cohort (weighted percentage, 35.3%; [95% CI, 25.6% to 46.4%]; within-matched pair adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.52 [95% CI, 0.79 to 2.91]). There was no association of documented COVID-19 infection with fatigue, substantial pain, limitations in either activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, severely curtailed life-space mobility, employment, or mean health-related quality of life on a utility scale. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of veterans with and without documented COVID-19, many reported a substantial loss of everyday functioning during the pandemic regardless of whether or not they had a documented infection with COVID-19. Future work with larger samples is needed to validate the estimated associations.","VA Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor VA, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.; School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.; School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.; Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation, Durham  VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.; Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University, Durham, North  Carolina.; VA Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor VA, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; VA Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor VA, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Departments of Anesthesiology, Epidemiology, and Psychiatry, University of  Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.; Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center, VA Puget Sound Health Care  System, Seattle, Washington.; University of Washington, Seattle.; VA Portland Healthcare System, Center to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care,  Portland, Oregon.; College of Health, and Center for Quantitative Life Sciences, Oregon State  University, Corvallis.; School of Nursing, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.; University of Washington, Seattle.; VA Puget Sound Health Care System Hospital and Specialty Medicine Service and  Seattle-Denver Center of Innovation for Veteran Centered and Value Driven Care, Seattle, Washington.; Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation, Durham  VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.; Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.; School of Nursing, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.; University of Washington, Seattle.; VA Puget Sound Health Care System Hospital and Specialty Medicine Service and  Seattle-Denver Center of Innovation for Veteran Centered and Value Driven Care, Seattle, Washington.; VA Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor VA, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.; Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation, Durham  VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.; Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation, Durham  VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.; School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.; VA Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor VA, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; VA Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor VA, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.; Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation, Durham  VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.; Durham Veterans Affairs Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Durham  Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.; Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.",2815652 [pii]; zoi240060 [pii]; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0869 [doi],Iwashyna TJ; Smith VA; Seelye S; Bohnert ASB; Boyko EJ; Hynes DM; Ioannou GN; Maciejewski ML; O'Hare AM; Viglianti EM; Berkowitz TS; Pura J; Womer J; Kamphuis LA; Monahan ML; Bowling CB,,,,VA HSR&D COVID-19 Observational Research Collaboratory (CORC),"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Seelye reported receiving grants from the  Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development (VA HSRD) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality outside the submitted work.

40055759,"BACKGROUND: While targeting the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) through the use of  sarilumab (SAR) or tocilizumab (TCZ) has become a major therapeutic approach for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), direct comparisons between IL-6R inhibitors (IL-6Ris) for treating RA have not been conducted. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of subcutaneous sarilumab (SAR-SC), subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ-SC), and intravenous TCZ (TCZ-IV) against RA in a multicenter cohort study. METHODS: Within the target trial emulation framework, an incident new-user and active-comparator cohort design was used. The source population was the entire cohort of a multicenter prospective study (the ANSWER cohort study) in Japan from 2009 to 2023. We consecutively included patients with IL-6Ri-naïve RA who initiated treatment with SAR-SC 200 mg biweekly, TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly, or TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks as the approved starting dose and dosing interval at baseline. The primary outcome of interest was the change in the clinical disease activity index (CDAI) at 24 weeks. RESULTS: In total, 1001 IL-6Ri-naïve patients were included (SAR-SC 200 mg biweekly, 201 patients; TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly, 546; TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 week, 254). The improvement in CDAI at 24 weeks (primary outcome) was statistically significantly greater in the SAR-SC group than in the TCZ-SC group (-2.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.38 to -0.69, p = 0.007), but that in TCZ-IV was not significantly different from that in TCZ-SC (1.00, 95% CI: -0.68 to 2.69, p = 0.243). Similar results were noted regarding the changes in CDAI at weeks 4, 12, and 48. The retention rates at 48 weeks in SAR-SC and TCZ-IV did not significantly differ from that in TCZ-SC. CONCLUSIONS: SAR-SC 200 mg biweekly initiation was associated with a statistically significantly greater decrease in disease activity than TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly in IL-6Ri-naïve patients with RA. In contrast, no statistically significant differences were identified between TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 week and TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly. However, the effect size of our findings should necessitate careful consideration of the cost difference between TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly including its biosimilars and SAR-SC 200 mg biweekly.","Department of Advanced Medicine for Rheumatic Diseases, Kyoto University Graduate  School of Medicine, 54, Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. telonishi@gmail.com.; Department of Advanced Medicine for Rheumatic Diseases, Kyoto University Graduate  School of Medicine, 54, Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.; Department of Advanced Medicine for Rheumatic Diseases, Kyoto University Graduate  School of Medicine, 54, Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine,  Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Advanced Medicine for Rheumatic Diseases, Kyoto University Graduate  School of Medicine, 54, Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine,  Kyoto, Japan.; Center for Cancer Immunotherapy and Immunobiology, Graduate School of Medicine,  Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Clinical Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka  Metropolitan University, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Clinical Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka  Metropolitan University, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine,  Osaka, Japan.; Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine,  Osaka, Japan.; Department of Health Information Management, Kurashiki Sweet Hospital, Okayama,  Japan.; Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Kobe University Graduate  School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.; Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Kobe University Graduate  School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine,  Osaka, Japan.; Department of Sports Medical Biomechanics, Osaka University Graduate School of  Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.; First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Internal Medicine (IV), Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical  University, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Internal Medicine (IV), Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical  University, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine,  Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Kyoto University Graduate  School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.",10.1186/s13075-025-03514-x [pii]; 3514 [pii]; 10.1186/s13075-025-03514-x [doi],Onishi A; Tanaka M; Fujii T; Murata K; Murakami K; Hashimoto M; Watanabe R; Nozaki Y; Ashida C; Yamamoto W; Yamada H; Sendo S; Ebina K; Makino H; Son Y; Wada Y; Hata K; Matsuda S; Morinobu A,ORCID: 0000-0002-3120-1273,© 2025.

39348705,"BACKGROUND: The optimal hemoglobin threshold to guide red blood cell (RBC)  transfusion for patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and anemia is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy of 4 individual hemoglobin thresholds (<10 g/dL [<100 g/L], <9 g/dL [<90 g/L], <8 g/dL [<80 g/L], and <7 g/dL [<70 g/L]) to guide transfusion in patients with acute MI and anemia. DESIGN: Prespecified secondary analysis of the MINT (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion) trial using target trial emulation methods. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02981407). SETTING: 144 clinical sites in 6 countries. PARTICIPANTS: 3492 MINT trial participants with acute MI and a hemoglobin level below 10 g/dL. INTERVENTION: Four transfusion strategies to maintain patients' hemoglobin concentrations at or above thresholds of 10, 9, 8, or 7 g/dL. Protocol exceptions were permitted for specified adverse clinical events. MEASUREMENTS: Data from the MINT trial were leveraged to emulate 4 transfusion strategies and estimate per protocol effects on the composite outcome of 30-day death or recurrent MI (death/MI) and 30-day death using inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: The 30-day risk for death/MI was 14.8% (95% CI, 11.8% to 18.4%) for a <10-g/dL strategy, 15.1% (CI, 11.7% to 18.2%) for a <9-g/dL strategy, 15.9% (CI, 12.4% to 19.0%) for a <8-g/dL strategy, and 18.3% (CI, 14.6% to 22.0%) for a <7-g/dL strategy. Absolute risk differences and risk ratios relative to the <10-g/dL strategy for 30-day death/MI increased as thresholds decreased, although 95% CIs were wide. Findings were similar and imprecise for 30-day death. LIMITATION: Unmeasured confounding may have persisted despite adjustment. CONCLUSION: The 30-day risks for death/MI and death among patients with acute MI and anemia seem to increase progressively with lower hemoglobin concentration thresholds for transfusion. However, the imprecision around estimates from this target trial analysis precludes definitive conclusions about individual hemoglobin thresholds.

37205340,"This study leverages electronic health record data in the National COVID Cohort  Collaborative's (N3C) repository to investigate disparities in Paxlovid treatment and to emulate a target trial assessing its effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 hospitalization rates. From an eligible population of 632,822 COVID-19 patients seen at 33 clinical sites across the United States between December 23, 2021 and December 31, 2022, patients were matched across observed treatment groups, yielding an analytical sample of 410,642 patients. We estimate a 65% reduced odds of hospitalization among Paxlovid-treated patients within a 28-day follow-up period, and this effect did not vary by patient vaccination status. Notably, we observe disparities in Paxlovid treatment, with lower rates among Black and Hispanic or Latino patients, and within socially vulnerable communities. Ours is the largest study of Paxlovid's real-world effectiveness to date, and our primary findings are consistent with previous randomized control trials and real-world studies.","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; RTI International, Durham, NC, USA.; School of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Johns Hopkins University,  Baltimore, MD, USA.; RTI International, Durham, NC, USA.; School of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Johns Hopkins University,  Baltimore, MD, USA.; RTI International, Durham, NC, USA.; Patient-Led Research Collaborative, NY, USA.; University of Rochester, Department of Public Health Sciences and Department of  Economics, Rochester, NY, USA.; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; School of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Johns Hopkins University,  Baltimore, MD, USA.; University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.; National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases, Office of the  Director, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; F.

38737003,"BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is used in patients with coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) with normal or mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). There is limited data regarding its use in advanced kidney disease (eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). We performed a retrospective territory-wide observational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir when compared with molnupiravir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 with advanced kidney disease. METHODS: We adopted target trial emulation using data from a territory-wide electronic health record database on eligible patients aged ≥18 years with advanced kidney disease (history of eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) who were infected with COVID-19 and were prescribed with either molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within five days of infection during the period from 16 March 2022 to 31 December 2022. A sequence trial approach and 1:4 propensity score matching was applied based on the baseline covariates including age, sex, number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), hospitalisation, eGFR, renal replacement therapy, comorbidities (cancer, respiratory disease, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, diabetes, hypertension), and drug use (renin-angiotensin-system agents, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, nitrates, lipid lowering agents, insulins, oral antidiabetic drugs, antiplatelets, immuno-suppressants, corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine H(2) receptor antagonists, monoclonal antibody infusion) within past 90 days. Individuals were followed up from the index date until the earliest outcome occurrence, death, 90 days from index date or the end of data availability. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted with baseline covariates was used to compare the risk of outcomes between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir recipients and molnupiravir recipients which include (i) all-cause mortality, (ii) intensive care unit (ICU) admission, (iii) ventilatory support, (iv) hospitalisation, (v) hepatic impairment, (vi) ischaemic stroke, and (vii) myocardial infarction. Subgroup analyses included age (<70; ≥70 years); sex, Charlson comorbidity index (≤5; >5), and number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received (0-1; ≥2 doses). FINDINGS: A total of 4886 patients were included (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 1462; molnupiravir: 3424). There were 347 events of all-cause mortality (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 74, 5.06%; molnupiravir: 273, 7.97%), 10 events of ICU admission (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 4, 0.27%; molnupiravir: 6, 0.18%), 48 events of ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 13, 0.89%; molnupiravir: 35, 1.02%), 836 events of hospitalisation (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 218, 23.98%; molnupiravir: 618, 28.14%), 1 event of hepatic impairment (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 0, 0%; molnupiravir: 1, 0.03%), 8 events of ischaemic stroke (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 3, 0.22%; molnupiravir: 5, 0.16%) and 9 events of myocardial infarction (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 2, 0.15%; molnupiravir: 7, 0.22%). Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users had lower rates of all-cause mortality (absolute risk reduction (ARR) at 90 days 2.91%, 95% CI: 1.47-4.36%) and hospitalisation (ARR at 90 days 4.16%, 95% CI: 0.81-7.51%) as compared with molnupiravir users. Similar rates of ICU admission (ARR at 90 days -0.09%, 95% CI: -0.4 to 0.2%), ventilatory support (ARR at 90 days 0.13%, 95% CI: -0.45 to 0.72%), hepatic impairment (ARR at 90 days 0.03%, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.09%), ischaemic stroke (ARR at 90 days -0.06%, 95% CI: -0.35 to 0.22%), and myocardial infarction (ARR at 90 days 0.07%, 95% CI: -0.19 to 0.33%) were found between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir users. Consistent results were observed in relative risk adjusted with baseline characteristics. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.624, 95% CI: 0.455-0.857) and hospitalisation (HR: 0.782, 95% CI: 0.64-0.954). INTERPRETATION: Patients with COVID-19 with advanced kidney disease receiving nirmatrelvir-ritonavir had a lower rate of all-cause mortality and hospital admission when compared with molnupiravir. Other adverse clinical outcomes were similar in both treatment groups.

40041442,"BACKGROUND: We applied a target trial emulation framework to estimate the  association between early and delayed initiation of remdesivir (RDV) with mortality in hospitalized adults between May 1, 2020, and July 31, 2024, with varying coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical severity. METHODS: Using electronic health records in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database, we emulated a sequence of randomized target trials initiated on each of the first 7 days of hospitalization. We identified 373 226 eligible person-trial hospitalizations, of which 53 959 were initiators and 319 267 were noninitiators of RDV treatment. Patients were divided into clinical severity subgroups based on baseline oxygenation, which included no supplemental oxygen (NSO), noninvasive supplemental oxygen (NISO), or invasive ventilation (IV). In each trial, initiators were matched with replacement to noninitiators receiving the same oxygenation type. Trials beginning on days 1-3 and days 4-7 of hospitalization were pooled separately to evaluate the effects of early and delayed initiation of RDV, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the marginal hazard ratio for mortality between initiators and noninitiators within each treatment delay. RESULTS: Across trials, 53 449 initiators were matched to 26 600 unique noninitiators. Early, but not delayed, RDV treatment was associated with a reduction in 60-day mortality in the NSO (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.95) and NISO subgroups (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99), but not in those receiving IV. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses.

39571122,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The benefit of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in  patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) and a baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score <10 is unclear because this subpopulation has been substantially excluded from large clinical trials. The aim of our study was to determine whether MT ± IV thrombolysis (IVT) improves functional outcomes compared with IVT alone in patients with BAO and a NIHSS score <10. METHODS: We emulated a hypothetical trial including adult patients with BAO, a baseline NIHSS score <10, and prestroke modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores 0-2, comparing MT (±IVT) with IVT alone. We acquired data from patients receiving MT (±IVT) within 24 hours of onset from the Italian Registry of Endovascular Treatment in Acute Stroke and data from patients treated only with IVT within 9 hours of symptom onset from the SITS International Stroke Thrombolysis Register, from 2011 until 2021. We used inverse probability weighting (IPW) adjusted for prespecified covariates to weight each individual's contribution to the outcome. The primary outcome was 90-day mRS scores 0-2. Secondary outcomes included 90-day mRS scores 0-1, 90-day mRS scores 4-5, mortality at 90 days, in-hospital death, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. RESULTS: Among the 764 patients recruited from the 2 databases (477 men [62.4%]; mean age [±SD] 67.88 [±13.9] years), 410 (53.7%) received MT±IVT and 354 (46.3%) only IVT. After applying IPW, our population was composed of 710 MT and 707 IVT patients. Of these, 454 MT-treated (63.9%) and 383 IVT-treated (54.2%) patients had a 90-day mRS score of 0-2 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.56 [95% CI 1.04-2.03]). MT was also associated with a higher rate of mRS scores 0-1 (aOR 2.01 [95% CI 1.37-2.95]) and a lower rate of in-hospital death (aOR 0.45 [95% CI 0.25-0.78]). Among the subgroups tested, MT had a larger effect on 90-day mRS scores 0-2 for patients with NIHSS scores 6-9 than for patients with a NIHSS score <6 (p for interaction 0.02). DISCUSSION: In a large-scale target trial emulation on patients with stroke from BAO and a NIHSS score <10, MT was associated with better functional outcomes compared with IVT alone. Further research is needed to confirm the benefit of MT in patients with a NIHSS score <6. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that MT ± intravenous thrombolysis is associated with better 90-day functional outcomes in patients with BAO and a NIHSS score < 10 compared with intravenous thrombolysis alone.","From the Department of Human Neuroscience (E.N., S.L., D.T.), Sapienza University  of Rome; Stroke Unit (E.N., F.S.), Ospedale dei Castelli, Ariccia (RM); Department of NEUROFARBA (G.P.), Neuroscience Section, University of Florence; Stroke Unit (A.C., M.D.M.), Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome; Neurology and Stroke Unit (V.S., T.T.), S.

38370787,"BACKGROUND: SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs)  reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, their effectiveness relative to each other and other second-line antihyperglycemic agents is unknown, without any major ongoing head-to-head trials. METHODS: Across the LEGEND-T2DM network, we included ten federated international data sources, spanning 1992-2021. We identified 1,492,855 patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) on metformin monotherapy who initiated one of four second-line agents (SGLT2is, GLP1-RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor [DPP4is], sulfonylureas [SUs]). We used large-scale propensity score models to conduct an active comparator, target trial emulation for pairwise comparisons. After evaluating empirical equipoise and population generalizability, we fit on-treatment Cox proportional hazard models for 3-point MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, death) and 4-point MACE (3-point MACE + heart failure hospitalization) risk, and combined hazard ratio (HR) estimates in a random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: Across cohorts, 16·4%, 8·3%, 27·7%, and 47·6% of individuals with T2DM initiated SGLT2is, GLP1-RAs, DPP4is, and SUs, respectively. Over 5·2 million patient-years of follow-up and 489 million patient-days of time at-risk, there were 25,982 3-point MACE and 41,447 4-point MACE events. SGLT2is and GLP1-RAs were associated with a lower risk for 3-point MACE compared with DPP4is (HR 0·89 [95% CI, 0·79-1·00] and 0·83 [0·70-0·98]), and SUs (HR 0·76 [0·65-0·89] and 0·71 [0·59-0·86]). DPP4is were associated with a lower 3-point MACE risk versus SUs (HR 0·87 [0·79-0·95]). The pattern was consistent for 4-point MACE for the comparisons above. There were no significant differences between SGLT2is and GLP1-RAs for 3-point or 4-point MACE (HR 1·06 [0·96-1·17] and 1·05 [0·97-1·13]). INTERPRETATION: In patients with T2DM and established CVD, we found comparable cardiovascular risk reduction with SGLT2is and GLP1-RAs, with both agents more effective than DPP4is, which in turn were more effective than SUs. These findings suggest that the use of GLP1-RAs and SGLT2is should be prioritized as second-line agents in those with established CVD.

39760780,"High-dose methotrexate (MTX) results in high rates of acute kidney injury (AKI),  neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity. Glucarpidase is a recombinant enzyme that cleaves MTX, but clinical data supporting its use are scarce. We examined the association between glucarpidase administration and outcomes in adults with MTX-AKI from 28 cancer centers across the United States using a sequential target trial emulation framework. The primary end point was kidney recovery at hospital discharge, defined as survival to discharge with serum creatinine <1.5-fold baseline and without dialysis dependence. Key secondary end points were time to kidney recovery, neutropenia, and transaminitis on day 7, and time to death. Using multivariable logistic and Cox regression models, we compared outcomes in patients who received glucarpidase within 4 days following MTX initiation with those in patients who did not. Among 708 patients with MTX-AKI, 209 (29.5%) received glucarpidase. Overall, 183 (25.8%) had a primary end point event. Glucarpidase receipt was associated with a 2.70-fold higher adjusted odds of kidney recovery (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-4.31) compared with no glucarpidase receipt. Patients treated with glucarpidase also had faster time to kidney recovery (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.33) and lower risks of grade ≥2 neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91) and grade ≥2 transaminitis (aOR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91) on day 7. There was no difference in time to death (aHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.49-1.18). These data suggest glucarpidase may improve both renal and extrarenal outcomes in patients with MTX-AKI.","Division of Renal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.; Adult Survivorship Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Division of Renal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA.; Division of Nephrology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.; Intermountain Kidney Services, Intermountain Health, Salt Lake City, UT.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at  Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State  University, Columbus, OH.; Department of Pharmacy, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.; Loxo@Lilly, Indianapolis, IN.; Medical Oncology and Hematology, Arizona Center for Cancer Care, Phoenix, AZ.; Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

40450157,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: National clinical guidelines recommend that second-line  treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus is chosen according to individuals' characteristics but there is limited evidence available to inform this choice. This paper's aim is to compare the effects on HbA(1c) of sulfonylureas (SU), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) added to metformin as second-line oral glucose-lowering treatments according to an individual's age, baseline HbA(1c) and presence of multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs). METHODS: We accessed primary care-hospital linked data for 41,790 individuals from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in England who initiated second-line treatment after metformin between 2015 and 2021. We combined target trial emulation with instrumental variable analysis to reduce the risk of confounding. The outcome was change in HbA(1c) between baseline and 1 year follow-up. We reported results stratified by age (18-49 years, 50-69 years and ≥70 years), baseline HbA(1c) (<67 mmol/mol [<8.3%], 67-77 mmol/mol [8.3-9.2%] and >77 mmol/mol [>9.2%]) and presence of MLTCs. RESULTS: The mean (95% CI) difference in HbA(1c) change for SGLT2i vs SU was larger for people aged 18-49 years (-5.74 mmol/mol [-7.47, -4.01]) (-0.5% [-0.7, -0.4]) than for those aged 50-69 years (-4.03 mmol/mol [-5.61, -2.44]) (-0.4% [-0.5, -0.2]) and for those aged 70 years or over (-2.68 mmol/mol [-4.50, -0.86]) (-0.3% [-0.4, -0.07]). The mean (95% CI) difference in HbA(1c) change for SGLT2i vs DPP4i was -5.80 mmol/mol (-7.60, -4.00) (-0.5% [-0.7, -0.4]) for those aged 18-49 years, -4.13 mmol/mol (-5.82, -2.45) (-0.4% [-0.5, -0.2]) for those aged 50-69 years and -3.13 mmol/mol (-5.01, -1.24) (-0.3% [-0.4, -0.1]) for those aged ≥70 years. The mean difference (improvement) in HbA(1c) was similar across subgroups defined by baseline HbA(1c) or presence of MLTCs. For SGLT2i vs SU, the mean (95% CI) difference was -5.37 mmol/mol (-7.13, -3.62) (-0.5% [-0.6, -0.3]) for people without MLTC and -3.72 mmol/mol (-5.34, -2.10]) (-0.3% [-0.5, -0.2]) for people with MLTC. For SGLT2i vs DPP4i the corresponding estimated differences (95% CI) were -5.44 mmol/mol (-7.27, -3.61) (-0.5% [-0.7, -0.3]) for those without MLTC and -3.93 mmol/mol (-5.64, -2.21) (-0.3% [-0.5, -0.2]) for those with MLTC. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Second-line treatment with SGLT2i is more effective than SU or DPP4i in reducing HbA(1c) across subgroups of people defined by age, baseline HbA(1c) and presence of MLTCs. Our evidence complements RCTs in using routinely available information on demographic characteristics, biomarkers and comorbidities to inform an individualised approach.","Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology & International Health, London  School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Heidelberg University, Medical Faculty of Heidelberg, Internal Medicine IX -  Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.; Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Social Research Institute, University  College London, London, UK.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Diabetes Trials Unit, The Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and  Metabolism, University of Oxford, OCDEM Building Churchill Hospital, Headington, UK.; Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.  kk22@leicester.ac.uk.; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene &  Tropical Medicine, London, UK.

39945185,"BACKGROUND: Whether the differing mechanistic effects between angiotensin-2  receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on the renin-angiotensin system translate to differential effects on clinical cognitive outcomes is unclear. METHODS: We employed an active comparator, new-user cohort study to emulate a target trial evaluating the per-protocol effect of initiating and continuously adhering to an ARB versus ACEI on adjudicated amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia (PD) in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted cumulative incidence functions accounted for confounding, the competing risk of death, adherence, and loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Of 9,361 SPRINT participants (mean age 67.1 ± 9.5 years, 36.7% female, 58.7% non-Hispanic White), 710 and 1,289 were new users of an ARB or ACEI. Overall, 291 (41.0%) ARB initiators and 854 (66.3%) ACEI initiators were nonadherent during follow-up. The IP-weighted 4-year probabilities of full adherence and being alive among ARB was 56.0% (95% CI: 52.2%-59.9%) and 30.5% (95% CI: 28.0%-33.1%) for ACEI. The 4-year weighted risk ratios (RR) for amnestic MCI/PD and for amnestic MCI/PD/death with initiation and full adherence to ARB versus ACEI were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.66-1.29) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.58-1.06). The weighted 4-year weighted RR for all-cause death with ARB versus ACEI initiation and adherence was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: In this target trial emulation of older adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease, there was insufficient evidence to conclude a beneficial effect of initiating and continuously adhering to an ARB versus ACEI on adjudicated clinical cognitive outcomes.","Intermountain Healthcare Department of Population Health Sciences, Spencer Fox  Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Intermountain Healthcare Department of Population Health Sciences, Spencer Fox  Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Intermountain Healthcare Department of Population Health Sciences, Spencer Fox  Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston,  Massachusetts, USA.; Intermountain Healthcare Department of Population Health Sciences, Spencer Fox  Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Intermountain Healthcare Department of Population Health Sciences, Spencer Fox  Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Intermountain Healthcare Department of Population Health Sciences, Spencer Fox  Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Institute for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.; Geriatrics Division, Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah,  Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; University of Utah Center on Aging, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Departments of Pathology, Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University,  Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine Section, Wake Forest School of Medicine,  Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, Wake Forest University School of  Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.; Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.; Department of Medicine, Renal-Electrolyte and Hypertension Division, Perelman  School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of  Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Intermountain Healthcare Department of Population Health Sciences, Spencer Fox  Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; George E.

39197980,"BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like  peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, their effectiveness relative to each other and other second-line antihyperglycemic agents is unknown, without any major ongoing head-to-head clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the cardiovascular effectiveness of SGLT2is, GLP-1 RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is), and clinical sulfonylureas (SUs) as second-line antihyperglycemic agents in T2DM. METHODS: Across the LEGEND-T2DM (Large-Scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation Across a Network of Databases for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) network, 10 federated international data sources were included, spanning 1992 to 2021. In total, 1,492,855 patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease (CVD) on metformin monotherapy were identified who initiated 1 of 4 second-line agents (SGLT2is, GLP-1 RAs, DPP4is, or SUs). Large-scale propensity score models were used to conduct an active-comparator target trial emulation for pairwise comparisons. After evaluating empirical equipoise and population generalizability, on-treatment Cox proportional hazards models were fit for 3-point MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) and 4-point MACE (3-point MACE plus heart failure hospitalization) risk and HR estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Over 5.2 million patient-years of follow-up and 489 million patient-days of time at risk, patients experienced 25,982 3-point MACE and 41,447 4-point MACE. SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs were associated with lower 3-point MACE risk than DPP4is (HR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.79-1.00] and 0.83 [95% CI: 0.70-0.98]) and SUs (HR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.65-0.89] and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.58-0.88]). DPP4is were associated with lower 3-point MACE risk than SUs (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79-0.95). The pattern for 3-point MACE was also observed for the 4-point MACE outcome. There were no significant differences between SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs for 3-point or 4-point MACE (HR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.96-1.17] and 1.05 [95% CI: 0.97-1.13]). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM and CVD, comparable cardiovascular risk reduction was found with SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs, with both agents more effective than DPP4is, which in turn were more effective than SUs. These findings suggest that the use of SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs should be prioritized as second-line agents in those with established CVD.","Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale  University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA; Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, USA; Section of Health Informatics, Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.

33528595,"PURPOSE: Limited data are available on venovenous extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We examined the clinical features and outcomes of 190 patients treated with ECMO within 14 days of ICU admission, using data from a multicenter cohort study of 5122 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to 68 hospitals across the United States. To estimate the effect of ECMO on mortality, we emulated a target trial of ECMO receipt versus no ECMO receipt within 7 days of ICU admission among mechanically ventilated patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100). Patients were followed until hospital discharge, death, or a minimum of 60 days. We adjusted for confounding using a multivariable Cox model. RESULTS: Among the 190 patients treated with ECMO, the median age was 49 years (IQR 41-58), 137 (72.1%) were men, and the median PaO(2)/FiO(2) prior to ECMO initiation was 72 (IQR 61-90). At 60 days, 63 patients (33.2%) had died, 94 (49.5%) were discharged, and 33 (17.4%) remained hospitalized. Among the 1297 patients eligible for the target trial emulation, 45 of the 130 (34.6%) who received ECMO died, and 553 of the 1167 (47.4%) who did not receive ECMO died. In the primary analysis, patients who received ECMO had lower mortality than those who did not (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.74). Results were similar in a secondary analysis limited to patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 80 (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.40-0.77). CONCLUSION: In select patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19, ECMO may reduce mortality.","Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess  Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 1 Deaconess Road, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. sshaefi@bidmc.harvard.edu.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton  Hall, Nutley, NJ, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Heart and Vascular Hospital, Hackensack Meridian  Health Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.; Division of Renal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess  Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 1 Deaconess Road, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.; Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess  Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 1 Deaconess Road, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.; Division of Nephrology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New  York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New  York, NY, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Rush University Medical Center,  Chicago, IL, USA.; Department of Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.; Department of Surgery, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall,  Nutley, NJ, USA.; Division of Cardiac Surgery, Heart and Vascular Hospital, Hackensack Meridian  Health Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.; Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado Anschutz  Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann  Arbor, MI, USA.; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Center for Translational Metabolism and  Health, Institute for Public Health and Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Icahn School of  Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of  Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, The Bronx, NY, USA.; Renal-Electrolyte and Hypertension Division, Perelman School of Medicine,  University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Division of Critical Care Medicine, Cooper University Health Care, Camden, NJ,  USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Baylor University Medical Center, Baylor  Research Institute, Dallas, TX, USA.; Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, University of Alabama  at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.; Division of Renal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Renal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University  Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.
