TI  - Target Trial Emulation to Improve Causal Inference from Observational Data: What, 
      Why, and How?
PG  - 1305-1314
LID - 10.1681/ASN.0000000000000152 [doi]
AB  - Target trial emulation has drastically improved the quality of observational 
      studies investigating the effects of interventions. Its ability to prevent 
      avoidable biases that have plagued many observational analyses has contributed to 
      its recent popularity. This review explains what target trial emulation is, why 
      it should be the standard approach for causal observational studies that 
      investigate interventions, and how to do a target trial emulation analysis. We 
      discuss the merits of target trial emulation compared with often used, but biased 
      analyses, as well as potential caveats, and provide clinicians and researchers 
      with the tools to better interpret results from observational studies 
      investigating the effects of interventions.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of omalizumab, mepolizumab, and dupilumab in asthma: 
      A target trial emulation.
PG  - 1269-1276
LID - S0091-6749(23)00144-6 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple mAbs are currently approved for the treatment of asthma. 
      However, there is limited evidence on their comparative effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: 
      Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of omalizumab, mepolizumab, and 
      dupilumab in individuals with moderate-to-severe asthma. METHODS: We emulated a 
      hypothetical randomized trial using electronic health records from a large 
      US-based academic health care system. Participants aged 18 years or older with 
      baseline IgE levels between 30 and 700 IU/mL and peripheral eosinophil counts of 
      at least 150 cells/μL were eligible for study inclusion. The study period 
      extended from March 2016 to August 2021. Outcomes included the incidence of 
      asthma-related exacerbations and change in baseline FEV(1) value over 12 months 
      of follow-up. RESULTS: In all, 68 individuals receiving dupilumab, 68 receiving 
      omalizumab, and 65 receiving mepolizumab met the inclusion criteria. Over 12 
      months of follow-up, 31 exacerbations occurred over 68 person years (0.46 
      exacerbations per person year) in the dupilumab group, 63 over 68 person years 
      (0.93 per person year) in the omalizumab group, and 86 over 65 person years (1.32 
      per person year) in the mepolizumab group (adjusted incidence rate ratios: 
      dupilumab vs mepolizumab, 0.28 [95% CI = 0.09-0.84]; dupilumab vs omalizumab, 
      0.36 [95% CI = 0.12-1.09]; and omalizumab vs mepolizumab, 0.78 [95% CI = 
      0.32-1.91]). The differences in the change in FEV(1) comparing patients who 
      received the different biologics were as follows: 0.11 L (95% CI = -0.003 to 
      0.222 L) for dupilumab versus mepolizumab, 0.082 L (95% CI -0.040 to 0.204 L) for 
      dupilumab versus omalizumab, and 0.026 L (95% CI -0.083 to 0.140 L) for 
      omalizumab versus mepolizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with asthma and 
      eosinophil counts of at least 150 cells/μL and IgE levels of 30 to 700 kU/L, 
      dupilumab was associated with greater improvements in exacerbation and FEV(1) 
      value than omalizumab and mepolizumab.

TI  - Benefits and Risks Associated With Statin Therapy for Primary Prevention in Old 
      and Very Old Adults : Real-World Evidence From a Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 701-710
LID - 10.7326/M24-0004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little consensus on using statins for primary prevention of 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and all-cause mortality in adults aged 75 years or 
      older due to the underrepresentation of this population in randomized controlled 
      trials. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the benefits and risks of using statins for 
      primary prevention in old (aged 75 to 84 years) and very old (aged ≥85 years) 
      adults. DESIGN: Sequential target trial emulation comparing matched cohorts 
      initiating versus not initiating statin therapy. SETTING: Territory-wide public 
      electronic medical records in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Persons aged 75 years or 
      older who met indications for statin initiation from January 2008 to December 
      2015 were included. Participants with preexisting diagnosed CVDs at baseline, 
      such as coronary heart disease (CHD), were excluded from the analysis. Among 
      69 981 eligible persons aged 75 to 84 years and 14 555 persons aged 85 years or 
      older, 41 884 and 9457 had history of CHD equivalents (for example, diabetes) in 
      the respective age groups. INTERVENTION: Initiation of statin therapy. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of major CVDs (stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart 
      failure), all-cause mortality, and major adverse events (myopathies and liver 
      dysfunction). RESULTS: Of 42 680 matched person-trials aged 75 to 84 years and 
      5390 matched person-trials aged 85 years or older (average follow-up, 5.3 years), 
      9676 and 1600 of them developed CVDs in each age group, respectively. Risk 
      reduction for overall CVD incidence was found for initiating statin therapy in 
      adults aged 75 to 84 years (5-year standardized risk reduction, 1.20% [95% CI, 
      0.57% to 1.82%] in the intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis; 5.00% [CI, 1.11% to 
      8.89%] in the per protocol [PP] analysis) and in those aged 85 years or older 
      (ITT: 4.44% [CI, 1.40% to 7.48%]; PP: 12.50% [CI, 4.33% to 20.66%]). No 
      significantly increased risks for myopathies and liver dysfunction were found in 
      both age groups. LIMITATION: Unmeasured confounders, such as lifestyle factors of 
      diet and physical activity, may exist. CONCLUSION: Reduction for CVDs after 
      statin therapy were seen in patients aged 75 years or older without increasing 
      risks for severe adverse effects. Of note, the benefits and safety of statin 
      therapy were consistently found in adults aged 85 years or older. PRIMARY FUNDING

PG  - 1233-1243
LID - 10.7326/M23-3028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For older adults with kidney failure who are not referred for 
      transplant, medical management is an alternative to dialysis. OBJECTIVE: To 
      compare survival and home time between older adults who started dialysis at an 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 12 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 
      those who continued medical management. DESIGN: Observational cohort study using 
      target trial emulation. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2010 to 
      2018. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years or older with chronic kidney failure and 
      eGFR below 12 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who were not referred for transplant. 
      INTERVENTION: Starting dialysis within 30 days versus continuing medical 
      management. MEASUREMENTS: Mean survival and number of days at home. RESULTS: 
      Among 20 440 adults (mean age, 77.9 years [SD, 8.8]), the median time to dialysis 
      start was 8.0 days in the group starting dialysis and 3.0 years in the group 
      continuing medical management. Over a 3-year horizon, the group starting dialysis 
      survived 770 days and the group continuing medical management survived 761 days 
      (difference, 9.3 days [95% CI, -17.4 to 30.1 days]). Compared with the group 
      continuing medical management, the group starting dialysis had 13.6 fewer days at 
      home (CI, 7.7 to 20.5 fewer days at home). Compared with the group continuing 
      medical management and forgoing dialysis completely, the group starting dialysis 
      had longer survival by 77.6 days (CI, 62.8 to 91.1 days) and 14.7 fewer days at 
      home (CI, 11.2 to 16.5 fewer days at home). LIMITATION: Potential for unmeasured 
      confounding due to lack of symptom assessments at eligibility; limited 
      generalizability to women and nonveterans. CONCLUSION: Older adults starting 
      dialysis when their eGFR fell below 12 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who were not referred for 
      transplant had modest gains in life expectancy and less time at home. PRIMARY

TI  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
      antibody/tyrosine kinase inhibitors with or without transarterial 
      chemoembolization as first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (CHANCE2201): a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 102622
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102622 [doi]
LID - 102622
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the treatment 
      of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unconfirmed. This study aimed to 
      assess the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus 
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody/tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs) with or without TACE as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. 
      METHODS: This nationwide, multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 
      advanced HCC patients receiving either TACE with ICIs plus anti-VEGF 
      antibody/TKIs (TACE-ICI-VEGF) or only ICIs plus anti-VEGF antibody/TKIs 
      (ICI-VEGF) from January 2018 to December 2022. The study design followed the 
      target trial emulation framework with stabilized inverse probability of treatment 
      weighting (sIPTW) to minimize biases. The primary outcome was overall survival 
      (OS). Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), objective 
      response rate (ORR), and safety. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT05332821. FINDINGS: Among 1244 patients included in the analysis, 802 (64.5%) 
      patients received TACE-ICI-VEGF treatment, and 442 (35.5%) patients received 
      ICI-VEGF treatment. The median follow-up time was 21.1 months and 20.6 months, 
      respectively. Post-application of sIPTW, baseline characteristics were 
      well-balanced between the two groups. TACE-ICI-VEGF group exhibited a 
      significantly improved median OS (22.6 months [95% CI: 21.2-23.9] vs 15.9 months 
      [14.9-17.8]; P < 0.0001; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.63 [95% CI: 0.53-0.75]). 
      Median PFS was also longer in TACE-ICI-VEGF group (9.9 months [9.1-10.6] vs 7.4 
      months [6.7-8.5]; P < 0.0001; aHR 0.74 [0.65-0.85]) per Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. A higher ORR was observed in 
      TACE-ICI-VEGF group, by either RECIST v1.1 or modified RECIST (41.2% vs 22.9%, 
      P < 0.0001; 47.3% vs 29.7%, P < 0.0001). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 178 
      patients (22.2%) in TACE-ICI-VEGF group and 80 patients (18.1%) in ICI-VEGF 
      group. INTERPRETATION: This multicenter study supports the use of TACE combined 
      with ICIs and anti-VEGF antibody/TKIs as first-line treatment for advanced HCC, 
      demonstrating an acceptable safety profile. FUNDING: National Natural Science

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for 
      recurrent nephrolithiasis among patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis or 
      gout: target trial emulation studies.
PG  - e080035

LID - e080035
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To emulate target trials comparing recurrence of nephrolithiasis among 
      patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis (overall and stratified by concomitant 
      gout) initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors versus an 
      active comparator. DESIGN: Target trial emulation studies. SETTING: Canadian 
      population database, January 2014 to June 2022. PARTICIPANTS: 20 146 patients 
      with nephrolithiasis and type 2 diabetes, including those with concomitant gout 
      at baseline, a high risk group. INTERVENTIONS: Initiation of an SGLT-2 inhibitor 
      or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, with a dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor as alternative comparator. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      The primary outcome was recurrent nephrolithiasis events ascertained from 
      diagnoses during emergency department visits, hospital admissions, or outpatient 
      visits. Secondary outcomes included nephrolithiasis resulting in hospital 
      admission or emergency department visits and flare-up of gout, as well as a 
      positive control outcome (genital infection) and negative control outcomes 
      (osteoarthritis encounter and appendicitis). Poisson and Cox proportional hazards 
      regression models were used (primary analyses), as well as overlap weighting. 
      RESULTS: After inverse probability of treatment weighting, 1924 recurrent 
      nephrolithiasis events occurred among the 14 456 weighted patients who used an 
      SGLT-2 inhibitor (105.3 per 1000 person years), compared with 853 events among 
      the 5877 weighted patients who used a GLP-1 receptor agonist (156.4 per 1000 
      person years). The adjusted rate ratio was 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.57 to 0.79) and rate difference was -51 (95% CI -63 to -40) per 1000 person 
      years, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 20. Among those with recently 
      active nephrolithiasis, the absolute rate difference was 219 per 1000 person 
      years (NNT of 5). Protective associations persisted for nephrolithiasis events 
      that required emergency department visits, hospital admissions, or procedures, 
      and when an SGLT-2 inhibitor was compared with a DPP-4 inhibitor (rate ratio 0.73 
      (0.68 to 0.78), rate difference -38 (-46 to -29) per 1000 person years (NNT of 
      26)). Protective associations also persisted among patients with nephrolithiasis 
      and concomitant gout, with a rate ratio of 0.67 (0.57 to 0.79) and rate 
      difference of -53 (95% CI -78 to -27) per 1000 person years versus a GLP-1 
      receptor agonist (NNT of 19), and 0.63 (0.55 to 0.72) and-62 (-81 to -42) per 
      1000 person years, respectively, versus a DPP-4 inhibitor (NNT of 16). 
      Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with a lower rate of gout 
      flare-ups (rate ratio 0.72, 0.54 to 0.95, rate difference -16, -31 to -1 per 1000 
      person years) compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists (0.65, 0.52 to 0.82, and -21, 
      -33 to -9 per 1000 person years) compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. SGLT-2 inhibitor 
      initiators showed higher risk of genital infection (eg, hazard ratio 2.21, 95% CI 
      1.68 to 2.90, and rate difference 13 per 1000 person years), but no altered risk 
      of osteoarthritis encounter (0.87, 0.68 to 1.1, and -2 per 1000 person years) or 
      appendicitis (1.07, 0.69 to 1.67, and 1 per 1000 person years). Results were 
      similar when propensity score overlap weighting was applied. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      benefits associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor for patients with nephrolithiasis in 
      these target trial emulations suggest they may be a useful addition to current 
      treatments to simultaneously manage nephrolithiasis recurrence and comorbidities, 
      including gout.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the implementation of Target Trial Emulation 
      (TTE) for causal inference, involving research topics, frequently used 
      strategies, and issues indicating the need for future improvements. STUDY DESIGN 
      AND SETTING: We performed a scoping review by following the Joanna Briggs 
      Institute (JBI) guidance and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. A health 
      research-focused librarian searched multiple medical databases, and two 
      independent reviewers completed screening and extraction within covidence review 
      management software. RESULTS: Our search resulted in 1,240 papers, of which 96 
      papers were eligible for data extraction. Results show a significant increase in 
      the use of TTE in 2018 and 2021. The study topics varied and focused primarily on 
      cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. 
      However, not all papers specified well all three critical components for 
      generating robust causal evidence: time-zero, random assignment simulation, and 
      comparison strategy. Some common issues were observed from retrieved papers, and 
      key limitations include residual confounding, limited generalizability, and a 
      lack of reporting guidance that need to be improved. CONCLUSION: Uneven adherence 
      to the TTE framework exists, and future improvements are needed to progress 
      applications using causal inference with observational data.

TI  - Evaluating Metformin Strategies for Cancer Prevention: A Target Trial Emulation 
      Using Electronic Health Records.
PG  - 690-699
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001626 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metformin users appear to have a substantially lower risk of cancer 
      than nonusers in many observational studies. These inverse associations may be 
      explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by 
      explicitly emulating a target trial. METHODS: We emulated target trials of 
      metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health 
      records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no 
      history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering 
      medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included 
      total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and 
      prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment 
      for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target 
      trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates 
      with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. RESULTS: Among 
      individuals with diabetes, the estimated 6-year risk differences (metformin - no 
      metformin) were -0.2% (95% CI = -1.6%, 1.3%) in the intention-to-treat analysis 
      and 0.0% (95% CI = -2.1%, 2.3%) in the per-protocol analysis. The corresponding 
      estimates for all site-specific cancers were close to zero. Among individuals 
      regardless of diabetes status, these estimates were also close to zero and more 
      precise. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that 
      appeared strongly protective. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the 
      hypothesis that metformin therapy does not meaningfully influence cancer 
      incidence. The findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target 
      trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses.

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Despite a lack of supporting evidence, current guidance 
      recommends against the use of metformin in people with advanced kidney 
      impairment. This observational study compared the outcomes of patients with type 
      2 diabetes who continued versus stopped metformin after developing stage 4 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      [eGFR]<30mL/min/1.73m(2)). STUDY DESIGN: Nationwide observational cohort study. 
      SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adults with type 2 diabetes and incident stage 4 CKD 
      in Scotland who were treated with metformin between January 2010 and April 2019. 
      EXPOSURE: Stopping versus continuing metformin within 6 months following incident 
      stage 4 CKD. OUTCOME: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes 
      included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Target 
      trial emulation with clone-censor-weight design and marginal structural models 
      fit for sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In a population of 371,742 Scottish 
      residents with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes before April 30, 2019, 4,278 were 
      identified as prevalent metformin users with incident CKD stage 4. Within 6 
      months of developing CKD stage IV, 1,713 (40.1%) individuals discontinued 
      metformin. Compared with continuing metformin, stopping metformin was associated 
      with a lower 3-year survival (63.7% [95% CI, 60.9-66.6] vs 70.5% [95% CI, 
      68.0-73.0]; HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.10-1.44]), and the incidence of MACE was similar 
      between both strategies (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.88-1.26]). Marginal structural 
      models confirmed the higher risk of all-cause mortality and similar risk of MACE 
      in patients who stopped versus continued metformin (all-cause mortality: HR, 1.34 
      [95% CI, 1.08-1.67]; MACE: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.81-1.33]). LIMITATIONS: Residual 
      confounding. CONCLUSIONS: The continued use of metformin may be appropriate when 
      eGFR falls below 30mL/min/1.73m(2). Randomized controlled trials are needed to 
      confirm these findings. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Current guidance recommends 
      against the use of metformin in people with advanced kidney impairment despite a 
      lack of evidence. It is therefore currently unclear how the decision to stop 
      versus continue metformin in patients who reach stage 4 CKD impacts their risk of 
      mortality and cardiovascular events. This study showed that stopping metformin 
      after reaching stage 4 CKD was associated with reduced survival that did not 
      appear to be mediated by an increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These 
      findings may support the continued use of metformin in patients with advanced 
      kidney impairment, but further research is needed to confirm these observations.

TI  - A Nationwide Target Trial Emulation Assessing the Risk of Antidepressant-Induced 
      Mania Among Patients With Bipolar Depression.
PG  - 630-638
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.20230477 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antidepressants are commonly used to treat bipolar depression but may 
      increase the risk of mania. The evidence from randomized controlled trials, 
      however, is limited by short treatment durations, providing little evidence for 
      the long-term risk of antidepressant-induced mania. The authors performed a 
      target trial emulation to compare the risk of mania among individuals with 
      bipolar depression treated or not treated with antidepressants over a 1-year 
      period. METHODS: The authors emulated a target trial using observational data 
      from nationwide Danish health registers. The study included 979 individuals with 
      bipolar depression recently discharged from a psychiatric ward. Of these, 358 
      individuals received antidepressant treatment, and 621 did not. The occurrence of 
      mania and bipolar depression over the following year was ascertained, and the 
      intention-to-treat effect of antidepressants was analyzed by using Cox 
      proportional hazards regression with adjustment for baseline covariates to 
      emulate randomized open-label treatment allocation. RESULTS: The fully adjusted 
      analyses revealed no statistically significant associations between treatment 
      with an antidepressant and the risk of mania in the full sample (hazard rate 
      ratio=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.61), in the subsample concomitantly treated with a 
      mood-stabilizing agent (hazard rate ratio=1.16, 95% CI=0.63-2.13), and in the 
      subsample not treated with a mood-stabilizing agent (hazard rate ratio=1.16, 95% 
      CI=0.65-2.07). Secondary analyses revealed no statistically significant 
      association between treatment with an antidepressant and bipolar depression 
      recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the risk of 
      antidepressant-induced mania is negligible and call for further studies to 
      optimize treatment strategies for individuals with bipolar depression.

TI  - Association of Semaglutide With Tobacco Use Disorder in Patients With Type 2 
      Diabetes : Target Trial Emulation Using Real-World Data.
PG  - 1016-1027
LID - 10.7326/M23-2718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reports of reduced desire to smoke in patients treated with 
      semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) medication for 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, have raised interest about its 
      potential benefit for tobacco use disorders (TUDs). OBJECTIVE: To examine the 
      association of semaglutide with TUD-related health care measures in patients with 
      comorbid T2DM and TUD. DESIGN: Emulation target trial based on a nationwide 
      population-based database of patient electronic health records. SETTING: United 
      States, 1 December 2017 to 31 March 2023. PARTICIPANTS: Seven target trials were 
      emulated among eligible patients with comorbid T2DM and TUD by comparing the new 
      use of semaglutide versus 7 other antidiabetes medications (insulins, metformin, 
      dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, 
      sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and other GLP-1RAs). MEASUREMENTS: The 
      TUD-related health care measures (medical encounter for diagnosis of TUD, smoking 
      cessation medication prescriptions, and smoking cessation counseling) that 
      occurred within a 12-month follow-up were examined using Cox proportional hazards 
      and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: The study compared 222 942 new users 
      of antidiabetes medications including 5967 of semaglutide. Semaglutide was 
      associated with a significantly lower risk for medical encounters for TUD 
      diagnosis compared with other antidiabetes medications, and was strongest 
      compared with insulins (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.74]) and 
      weakest but statistically significant compared with other GLP-1RAs (HR, 0.88 [CI, 
      0.81 to 0.96]). Semaglutide was associated with reduced smoking cessation 
      medication prescriptions and counseling. Similar findings were observed in 
      patients with and without a diagnosis of obesity. For most of the group 
      comparisons, the differences occurred within 30 days of prescription initiation. 
      LIMITATION: Documentation bias, residual confounding, missing data on current 
      smoking behavior, body mass index, and medication adherence. CONCLUSION: 
      Semaglutide was associated with lower risks for TUD-related health care measures 
      in patients with comorbid T2DM and TUD compared with other antidiabetes 
      medications including other GLP-1Ras, primarily within 30 days of prescription. 
      These findings suggest the need for clinical trials to evaluate semaglutide's 
      potential for TUD treatment. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institutes of

AB  - Target trial emulation is the process of mimicking target randomized trials using 
      real-world data, where effective confounding control for unbiased treatment 
      effect estimation remains a main challenge. Although various approaches have been 
      proposed for this challenge, a systematic evaluation is still lacking. Here we 
      emulated trials for thousands of medications from two large-scale real-world data 
      warehouses, covering over 10 years of clinical records for over 170 million 
      patients, aiming to identify new indications of approved drugs for Alzheimer's 
      disease. We assessed different propensity score models under the inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting framework and suggested a model selection 
      strategy for improved baseline covariate balancing. We also found that the deep 
      learning-based propensity score model did not necessarily outperform logistic 
      regression-based methods in covariate balancing. Finally, we highlighted five 
      top-ranked drugs (pantoprazole, gabapentin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, and 
      omeprazole) originally intended for other indications with potential benefits for 
      Alzheimer's patients.

TI  - A retrospective 'target trial emulation' comparing amiodarone and lidocaine for 
      adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation.
PG  - 110515

LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2025.110515 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The administration of amiodarone or lidocaine is recommended during 
      the resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients presenting 
      with defibrillation-refractory or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or 
      ventricular tachycardia. Our objective was to use 'target trial emulation' 
      methodology to compare the outcomes of patients who received amiodarone or 
      lidocaine during resuscitation. METHODS: Adult, non-traumatic OHCA patients in 
      the ESO Data Collaborative 2018-2023 datasets who experienced OHCA prior to EMS 
      arrival, presented with a shockable rhythm, and received amiodarone or lidocaine 
      during resuscitation were evaluated for inclusion. We used propensity score 
      matching (PSM) to investigate the association between antiarrhythmic and 
      outcomes. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was the primary outcome. 
      Secondary outcomes included the number of post-drug defibrillations and survival 
      to hospital discharge. RESULTS: After application of exclusion criteria, 23,263 
      patients from 1,707 EMS agencies were eligible for analysis. Prior to PSM, 
      6,010/20,284 (29.6%) of the patients who received amiodarone and 1,071/2,979 
      (35.9%) of the patients who received lidocaine achieved prehospital ROSC. 
      Following PSM, lidocaine administration was associated with greater odds of 
      prehospital ROSC (36.0 vs. 30.4%; aOR: 1.29 [1.16, 1.44], n = 2,976 matched 
      pairs). Lidocaine administration was also associated with fewer post-drug 
      defibrillations (median: 2 [0-4] vs. 2 [0-6], mean: 3.3 vs. 3.9, p < 0.01, 
      n = 2,976 pairs), and greater odds of survival to discharge (35.1 vs. 25.7%; OR: 
      1.54 [1.19, 2.00], n = 538 pairs). CONCLUSION: Our 'target trial emulation' 
      suggested that lidocaine was associated with greater odds of prehospital ROSC in 
      comparison to amiodarone when administered during resuscitation from shock 
      refractory or recurrent VF/VT.

TI  - Do We Need to Administer Fludrocortisone in Addition to Hydrocortisone in Adult 
      Patients With Septic Shock? An Updated Systematic Review With Bayesian Network 
      Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and an Observational Study With 
      Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - e193-e202

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis evaluated 
      the efficacy and safety of hydrocortisone combined with fludrocortisone or 
      hydrocortisone alone, compared with placebo in adult patients with septic shock. 
      DATA SOURCES: By extending a prior Cochrane review, databases, including PubMed, 
      Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov , along with other relevant 
      websites, were searched until August 31, 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies using target trial emulation 
      were included. DATA EXTRACTION: The primary outcome was short-term mortality with 
      an emphasis on 28- or 30-day mortality as the main measure and in-hospital or ICU 
      mortality as the nearest surrogate of this measure. Three of the most common 
      adverse events, namely, gastroduodenal bleeding, superinfection, and 
      hyperglycemia, were also considered. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 19 studies 
      involving 95,841 patients were included. Hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone 
      showed the lowest short-term mortality versus placebo (odds ratio [OR]: 0.79; 95% 
      credible interval [CrI], 0.64-0.99; number needed to treat [NNT]: 21, range: 
      12-500; low certainty of evidence) in terms of informative priors. The surface 
      under the cumulative ranking curve values for hydrocortisone plus 
      fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone alone, and placebo were 0.9469, 0.4542, and 
      0.0989, respectively. Consistent results were observed in RCTs alone and those 
      using a daily 200-mg dose of hydrocortisone. Although gastroduodenal bleeding or 
      superinfection showed no clear increase, hyperglycemia risk increased. The ORs 
      were 0.53 for placebo versus hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone and 0.64 for 
      placebo versus hydrocortisone alone, with very low certainty of evidence. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In adults with septic shock, hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone 
      improved short-term survival with minimal adverse events compared with 
      hydrocortisone alone or placebo. However, these findings are not definitive due 
      to the limited certainty of evidence and wide NNT range. Additional large-scale, 
      placebo-controlled RCTs are needed to provide conclusive evidence.

      comparative effectiveness or safety of interventions, causal inferences are drawn 
      using observational data. A helpful 2-step framework for causal inference from 
      observational data is 1) specifying the protocol of the hypothetical randomized 
      pragmatic trial that would answer the causal question of interest (the target 
      trial), and 2) using the observational data to attempt to emulate that trial. The 
      target trial framework can improve the quality of observational analyses by 
      preventing some common biases. In this article, we discuss the utility and scope 
      of applications of the framework. We clarify that target trial emulation resolves 
      problems related to incorrect design but not those related to data limitations. 
      We also describe some settings in which adopting this approach is advantageous to 
      generate effect estimates that can close the gaps that randomized trials have not 
      filled. In these settings, the target trial framework helps reduce the ambiguity 
      of causal questions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, real-world data and observational 
      studies played an important role in assessing treatment effectiveness. 
      Methodological challenges such as confounding, immortal time bias, and competing 
      risks were observed. Target trial emulation provides a structured framework for 
      evaluating treatment effectiveness using observational data while mitigating 
      these biases. OBJECTIVES: To describe common biases in observational COVID-19 
      research, introduce the target trial emulation framework, and discuss how these 
      biases can be addressed in this framework. Specifically, we discuss the 
      clone-censor-weight approach and provide real-world study examples demonstrating 
      its application in COVID-19 research. SOURCES: We summarise key principles of 
      target trial emulation and the clone-censor-weight approach using published 
      methodological articles. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical 
      implementation by reviewing three studies that emulated a target trial to 
      evaluate the effects of treatments in patients with COVID-19. These studies were 
      selected without a predefined search strategy. CONTENT: We define and discuss 
      confounding, immortal time bias, and competing risks in studies using 
      observational data. To facilitate the understanding of these biases, we use a 
      hypothetical example evaluating the effects of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalised 
      patients with COVID-19. We provide an overview of the target trial emulation 
      framework and its core elements, explaining how it can mitigate these challenges. 
      To illustrate the clone-censor-weight approach, we describe published examples 
      demonstrating its application during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: Target 
      trial emulation is an important framework for evaluating treatment effects using 
      observational data, but it requires careful implementation to mitigate 
      methodological biases. Identifying and addressing confounding, immortal time 
      bias, and competing risks during study design and analysis are important in any 
      causal study evaluating treatment effects. This framework can improve the quality 
      of observational studies and complement evidence from clinical trials, 
      particularly when evidence is urgently needed, as during the first waves of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - PURPOSE: To apply target trial emulation to explore the potential impact of 
      eligibility criteria on the primary outcome of a randomized controlled trial. 
      METHODS: Simulations of a real-world explanatory trial of transarterial 
      radioembolization for advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with portal 
      vein invasion were performed to examine the effects of cohort specification on 
      survival outcomes and patient sample size. Simulations comprised 24 different 
      permutations of the trial varied on three disease nonspecific eligibility 
      parameters. Treatment and control arms for these emulated trials were drawn from 
      the National Cancer Database and matched by treatment propensity. Target trial 
      emulation served as the causal framework for this analysis, allowing the 
      architecture of a true controlled experiment to address forms of bias routinely 
      encountered in comparative effectiveness studies involving real-world 
      observational data. RESULTS: Twenty-four propensity score-matched cohorts 
      comprising a wider clinical spectrum of patients than specified by the original 
      target trial were successfully generated using the National Cancer Database. The 
      arms for each of the emulated trials demonstrated exchangeability across all 
      eligibility criteria and other clinical covariates. Significant treatment 
      benefits were associated with only a narrow range of eligibility criteria, 
      indicating that the original target trial was well specified. CONCLUSION: The 
      impact of patient selection on treatment outcomes can be studied using target 
      trial emulation. This analytical framework can furthermore serve to leverage 
      existing real-world data to inform the task of cohort specification for a 
      randomized controlled trial, facilitating a more data-driven approach for this 
      important step in clinical trial design.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation for Evaluating Health Policy.

LID - 10.7326/M23-2440 [doi]
AB  - Target trial emulation is an approach to designing rigorous nonexperimental 
      studies by "emulating" key features of a clinical trial. Most commonly used 
      outside of policy contexts, this approach is also valuable for policy evaluation 
      as policies typically are not randomly assigned. In this article, we discuss the 
      application of the target trial emulation framework in a policy evaluation 
      context. The policy trial emulation framework includes 7 components: the units 
      and eligibility criteria, definitions of the exposure and comparison conditions, 
      assignment mechanism, baseline ("time zero") and follow-up, outcomes, causal 
      estimand, and statistical analysis and assumptions. Policy evaluations that 
      emulate a randomized trial across these dimensions can yield estimates of the 
      causal effects of the policy on outcomes. Using the policy trial emulation 
      framework to conduct and report on research design and methods supports 
      transparent assessment of threats to causal inference in nonexperimental studies 
      intended to assess the effect of a health policy on clinical or population health 
      outcomes.

AB  - Conducting randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in rare paediatric diseases is 
      often impractical or prohibitively expensive. Observational data from 
      longitudinal cohort studies, disease registries, and population-based databases 
      exist for children and adolescents, but standard observational analyses are 
      typically limited by bias. Target trial emulation methods can improve the quality 
      of observational analysis, address common sources of bias, and help fill evidence 
      gaps in paediatric clinical practice. Applying target trial emulation methods in 
      paediatric research creates unique opportunities, but also poses specific 
      challenges. Tailored approaches are needed to address issues with small sample 
      size, treatment-effect heterogeneity, longitudinal follow-up, and missing data. 
      This Review aims to outline key concepts, such as what causal inference and 
      target trial emulation are, justify the use of target trial emulation methods in 
      paediatric observational research, discuss approaches to emulating key elements 
      of an RCT protocol, and highlight unique paediatric applications of target trial 
      emulation.

TI  - Comparison of the Test-negative Design and Cohort Design With Explicit Target 
      Trial Emulation for Evaluating COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness.
PG  - 137-149
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001709 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies are used for estimating vaccine effectiveness 
      under real-world conditions. The practical performance of two common 
      approaches-cohort and test-negative designs-need to be compared for COVID-19 
      vaccines. METHODS: We compared the cohort and test-negative designs to estimate 
      the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19 outcomes using 
      nationwide data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. 
      Specifically, we (1) explicitly emulated a target trial using follow-up data and 
      evaluated the potential for confounding using negative controls and benchmarking 
      to a randomized trial, (2) performed case-control sampling of the cohort to 
      confirm empirically that the same estimate is obtained, (3) further restricted 
      the sampling to person-days with a test, and (4) implemented additional features 
      of a test-negative design. We also compared their performance in limited 
      datasets. RESULTS: Estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness was similar under all 
      four designs. Empirical results suggested limited residual confounding by 
      healthcare-seeking behavior. Analyses in limited datasets showed evidence of 
      residual confounding, with estimates biased downward in the cohort design and 
      upward in the test-negative design. CONCLUSION: Vaccine effectiveness estimates 
      under a cohort design with explicit target trial emulation and a test-negative 
      design were similar when using rich information from the VA healthcare system, 
      but diverged in opposite directions when using a limited dataset. In settings 
      like ours with sufficient information on confounders and other key variables, the 
      cohort design with explicit target trial emulation may be preferable as a 
      principled approach that allows estimation of absolute risks and facilitates 
      interpretation of effect estimates.

AB  - PURPOSE: Invasive ventilation is a fundamental treatment in intensive care but 
      its precise timing is difficult to determine. This study aims at assessing the 
      effect of initiating invasive ventilation versus waiting, in patients with 
      hypoxemic respiratory failure without immediate reason for intubation on one-year 
      mortality. METHODS: Emulation of a target trial to estimate the benefit of 
      immediately initiating invasive ventilation in hypoxemic respiratory failure, 
      versus waiting, among patients within the first 48-h of hypoxemia. The eligible 
      population included non-intubated patients with SpO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 200 and 
      SpO(2) ≤ 97%. The target trial was emulated using a single-center database 
      (MIMIC-IV) which contains granular information about clinical status. The hourly 
      probability to receive mechanical ventilation was continuously estimated. The 
      hazard ratios for the primary outcome, one-year mortality, and the secondary 
      outcome, 30-day mortality, were estimated using weighted Cox models with 
      stabilized inverse probability weights used to adjust for measured confounding. 
      RESULTS: 2996 Patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of whom 792 were 
      intubated within 48 h. Among the non-invasive support devices, the use of oxygen 
      through facemask was the most common (75%). Compared to patients with the same 
      probability of intubation but who were not intubated, intubation decreased the 
      hazard of dying for the first year after ICU admission HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.68-0.96, 
      p = 0.018). Intubation was associated with a 30-day mortality HR of 0.80 (95% CI 
      0.64-0.99, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The initiation of mechanical ventilation in 
      patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure reduced the hazard of dying in 
      this emulation of a target trial.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation: Improving the Quality of Observational Studies in 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Using the Principles of Randomized Trials.
PG  - 843-849
LID - 10.1093/ibd/izae131 [doi]
AB  - The past decade has seen a substantial increase in the number of randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard method for generating robust 
      evidence of drug safety and efficacy but are expensive, time-consuming, and may 
      have ethical implications. Observational studies in IBD are often used to fill 
      the gaps in evidence but are typically hindered by significant bias. There are 
      several approaches for making statistical inferences from observational data with 
      some that focus on study design and others on statistical techniques. Target 
      trial emulation is an emerging methodological process that aims to bridge this 
      gap and improve the quality of observational studies by applying the principles 
      of an ideal, or "target," randomized trial to routinely collected clinical data. 
      There has been a rapid expansion of observational studies that have emulated 
      trials over the past 5 years in other medical fields, but this has yet to be 
      adopted in gastroenterology and IBD. The wealth of nonrandomized clinical data 
      available through electronic health records, patient registries, and 
      administrative health databases afford innumerable hypothesis-generating 
      opportunities for IBD research. This review outlines the principles of target 
      trial emulation, discusses the merits to IBD observational studies in reducing 
      the most common biases and improving confidence in causality, and details the 
      caveats of using this approach.

TI  - Conducting observational analyses with the target trial emulation approach: a 
      methodological systematic review.
PG  - e086595
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2024-086595 [doi]
LID - e086595
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Target trial emulation is an approach that is increasingly used to 
      improve transparency in observational studies and help mitigate biases. For 
      studies declaring that they emulated a target trial, we aimed to evaluate the 
      specification of the target trial, examine its consistency with the observational 
      emulation and assess the risk of bias in the observational analysis. DESIGN: 
      Methodological systematic review reported in accordance with the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. DATA SOURCES: 
      The database MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) 
      was interrogated for all studies published from 1 January 2021 to 3 July 2022. We 
      performed an additional manual search of 20 general medical and specialised 
      journals that spanned the same period. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All studies that 
      declared emulating a hypothetical or real randomised trial were eligible. DATA 
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers performed the whole 
      systematic review process (screening and selection of studies, data extraction 
      and risk of bias assessment). The main outcomes were the definition of the key 
      protocol components of the target trial and its emulation, consistency between 
      the target trial and its emulation and risk of bias according to the ROBINS-I 
      (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) tool. RESULTS: Among 
      the selected sample of 100 studies, 24 (24%) did not specify the target trial. 
      Only 40 studies (40%) provided detailed information on all components of the 
      target trial protocol. Eligibility criteria, intervention strategies and outcomes 
      were consistent between the target trial and its emulation in 35 studies (46% of 
      those specifying the target trial). Overall, 28 studies (28%) exhibited serious 
      risk of bias and 41 (41%) had misalignments in the timing of eligibility 
      assessment, treatment assignment and the start of follow-up (time-zero). As 
      compared with studies that did not specify the target trial, those that did 
      specify the trial less frequently seemed to have both time-zero issues (39% vs 
      52%) and serious risk of bias (26% vs 33%). CONCLUSIONS: One-quarter of studies 
      declaring that they emulated a target trial did not specify the trial. Target 
      trials and their emulations were particularly inconsistent for studies emulating 
      a real randomised trial. Risk of methodological issues seemed lower in 
      observational analyses that specified versus did not specify the target trial.

TI  - Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care 
      unit: a target trial emulation.
PG  - 1078-1086
LID - 10.1007/s00134-025-07979-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sodium bicarbonate is commonly administered to treat metabolic acidosis 
      in intensive care units (ICUs). There is limited evidence from randomized trials 
      to support this practice, and observational studies show conflicting results. Our 
      aim was to perform a target trial emulation evaluating the effect of bicarbonate 
      therapy on mortality. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using data from 12 
      Australian ICUs. Inclusion criteria were adults with pH < 7.3 and 
      PCO(2) ≤ 45 mmHg within the first three days. We excluded repeat admissions, 
      toxicology, diabetic ketoacidosis, and pre-existing end-stage renal failure. The 
      treatment intervention was sodium-bicarbonate administration, and the primary 
      outcome was 30-day ICU mortality with ICU discharge as a competing event. We 
      evaluated multiple subgroups, including patients with acute kidney injury, 
      requirement for vasoactive therapy, and pH < 7.2. The primary model utilized a 
      parametric g-computation and rolling entry matching was performed as a 
      sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We identified 6157 eligible admissions, of which 
      1764 (29%) received sodium bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy was associated with a 
      1.9% absolute mortality reduction for the primary analysis [risk ratio 0.86, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 0.91], and significant benefits were seen across 
      all subgroups evaluated. A similar point estimate of 2.1% was observed in the 
      sensitivity analysis, with a sustained mortality reduction seen at 30 days. 
      CONCLUSION: In this target trial emulation, bicarbonate administration was 
      associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in mortality for 
      patients with metabolic acidosis. Large sample sizes would be required to 
      demonstrate this effect in a randomized trial.

TI  - Early versus Delayed Switching from Controlled to Assisted Ventilation: A Target 
      Trial Emulation.
PG  - 975-983
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202406-1162OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: In critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, 
      switching from controlled to assisted ventilation is a crucial milestone toward 
      ventilator liberation. The optimal timing for switching to assisted ventilation 
      has not been studied. Objectives: Our objective was to determine whether a 
      strategy of early compared with delayed switching affects the duration of 
      invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and mortality. Methods: We 
      conducted a target trial emulation using the prospective, global WEAN SAFE (the 
      WorldwidE AssessmeNt of Separation of pAtients From ventilatory assistancE) 
      dataset. Patients were eligible for switching if they were still on controlled 
      mechanical ventilation, were not receiving neuromuscular blockers, and had 
      Pa(O(2)):Fi(O(2)) ratios >150 mm Hg. We compared an "early switching" strategy 
      (switch within 1 day after reaching switching eligibility criteria) with a 
      "delayed switching" strategy (switch 1 or more days after reaching the switching 
      eligibility criteria). The primary outcome was the 28-day cumulative incidence of 
      successful extubation. Secondary outcomes included 28-day and 90-day ICU 
      discharge and ICU mortality. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,489 
      patients met the switching eligibility criteria. The early-switch group had, on 
      average, 4 additional days of being successfully extubated over the 28-day period 
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 3-6 days; P < 0.001) compared with the delayed 
      group, with a higher difference in cumulative incidence of successful extubation 
      at Day 28 (7% [95% CI, 0-13%]; P = 0.04). Early switching was associated with an 
      11% higher cumulative incidence of ICU discharge at Day 28 (95% CI, 7-18%; 
      P < 0.001) and an average of 7 additional days discharged from the ICU over the 
      90-day period (95% CI, 4-12 days; P < 0.001) compared with delayed switching. ICU 
      mortality rates did not differ between the strategies. Conclusions: Early 
      switching from controlled to assisted ventilation is associated with shorter 
      duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU stay compared with delayed 
      switching.

TI  - Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists and Risk for Suicidal Ideation and 
      Behaviors in U.S. Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes : A Target Trial Emulation 
      Study.
PG  - 1004-1015
LID - 10.7326/M24-0329 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major concern has recently emerged about a potential link between 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and increased risk for 
      suicidal ideation and behaviors based on International Classification of Diseases 
      codes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between GLP-1 RAs, compared with 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
      inhibitors (DPP4is), and risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors in older adults 
      with type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN: Two target trial emulation studies comparing 
      propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts for GLP-1 RAs versus SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs 
      versus DPP4is. SETTING: U.S. national Medicare administrative data from January 
      2017 to December 2020. PATIENTS: Older adults (≥66 years) with T2D; no record of 
      suicidal ideation or behaviors; and a first prescription for a GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i, 
      or DPP4i. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was a composite of suicidal 
      ideation and behaviors. New GLP-1 RA users were matched 1:1 on PS to new users of 
      an SGLT2i or DPP4i in each pairwise comparison. A Cox proportional hazards 
      regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CIs within matched 
      groups. RESULTS: This study included 21 807 pairs of patients treated with a 
      GLP-1 RA versus an SGLT2i and 21 402 pairs of patients treated with a GLP-1 RA 
      versus a DPP4i. The HR of suicidal ideation and behaviors associated with GLP-1 
      RAs relative to SGLT2is was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.45; rate difference, 0.16 
      [CI, -0.53 to 0.86] per 1000 person-years); the HR relative to DPP4is was 0.94 
      (CI, 0.71 to 1.24; rate difference, -0.18 [CI, -0.92 to 0.57] per 1000 
      person-years). LIMITATIONS: Low event rate; imprecise estimates; unmeasured 
      confounders, such as body mass index; and potential misclassification of 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: Among Medicare beneficiaries with T2D, this study found no 
      clear increased risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors with GLP-1 RAs, although 
      estimates were imprecise and a modest adverse risk could not be ruled out.

TI  - Target trial emulation of aspirin after diagnosis of colorectal polyps.
PG  - 1105-1114
LID - 10.1007/s10654-023-01024-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGOUND AND AIMS: Previous research on the potential chemoprotective effect of 
      aspirin for colorectal cancer (CRC) shows conflicting results. We aimed to 
      emulate a trial of aspirin intiation in individuals with incident polyps. 
      METHODS: We identified individuals registered with their first colorectal polyp 
      in the nationwide gastrointestinal ESPRESSO histopathology cohort in Sweden. 
      Individuals aged 45-79 years diagnosed with colorectal polyps 2006-2016 in Sweden 
      without CRC or contraindications for preventive aspirin (cerebrovascular disease, 
      heart failure, aortic aneurysms, pulmonary emboli, myocardial infarction, gastric 
      ulcer, dementia, liver cirrhosis, or any other metastatic cancer) registered 
      until the month of first polyp detection were eligible. Using duplication and 
      inverse probability weighting, we emulated a target trial of aspirin initiation 
      within 2 years of initial polyp detection. The main outcome measures were 
      incident CRC, CRC mortality and all-cause mortality registered until 2019. 
      RESULTS: Of 31,633 individuals meeting our inclusion criteria, 1716 (5%) 
      initiated aspirin within 2 years of colon polyp diagnosis. Median follow-up was 
      8.07 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence in initiators versus non-initiators 
      was 6% versus 8% for CRC incidence, 1% versus 1% for CRC mortality and 21% versus 
      18% for all-cause mortality. The corresponding hazard ratios were 0.88 (95% 
      confidence interval, 95%CI = 0.86-0.90), 0.90 (95%CI = 0.75-1.06) and 1.18 
      (95%CI = 1.12-1.24). CONCLUSION: Aspirin initiation in individuals with polyp 
      removal was linked to 2% lower cumulative incidence of CRC after 10 years but did 
      not alter CRC mortality. We also observed a 4% increased risk difference of 
      all-cause mortality at 10 years after the initiation of aspirin.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation Using Hospital-Based Observational Data: Demonstration and 
      Application in COVID-19.
LID - 10.3390/life13030777 [doi]
LID - 777
AB  - Methodological biases are common in observational studies evaluating treatment 
      effectiveness. The objective of this study is to emulate a target trial in a 
      competing risks setting using hospital-based observational data. We extend 
      established methodology accounting for immortal time bias and time-fixed 
      confounding biases to a setting where no survival information beyond hospital 
      discharge is available: a condition common to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      research data. This exemplary study includes a cohort of 618 hospitalized 
      patients with COVID-19. We describe methodological opportunities and challenges 
      that cannot be overcome applying traditional statistical methods. We demonstrate 
      the practical implementation of this trial emulation approach via 
      clone-censor-weight techniques. We undertake a competing risk analysis, reporting 
      the cause-specific cumulative hazards and cumulative incidence probabilities. Our 
      analysis demonstrates that a target trial emulation framework can be extended to 
      account for competing risks in COVID-19 hospital studies. In our analysis, we 
      avoid immortal time bias, time-fixed confounding bias, and competing risks bias 
      simultaneously. Choosing the length of the grace period is justified from a 
      clinical perspective and has an important advantage in ensuring reliable results. 
      This extended trial emulation with the competing risk analysis enables an 
      unbiased estimation of treatment effects, along with the ability to interpret the 
      effectiveness of treatment on all clinically important outcomes.

TI  - Cardiovascular Safety and Fracture Prevention Effectiveness of Denosumab Versus 
      Oral Bisphosphonates in Patients Receiving Dialysis : A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 167-176
LID - 10.7326/ANNALS-24-03237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients have high rates of fracture morbidity, but evidence 
      on optimal management strategies for osteoporosis is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine the risk for cardiovascular events and fracture prevention effects with 
      denosumab compared with oral bisphosphonates in dialysis-dependent patients. 
      DESIGN: An observational study that attempts to emulate a target trial. SETTING: 
      A Japanese administrative claims database (April 2014 to October 2022). PATIENTS: 
      Adults aged 50 years or older who have initiated denosumab or oral 
      bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in dialysis-dependent patients. MEASUREMENTS: 
      The safety outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The effectiveness 
      outcome was a composite of all fractures. Follow-up was 3 years. RESULTS: A total 
      of 1032 patients were identified (658 denosumab users and 374 oral bisphosphonate 
      users). Overall average age was 74.5 years, and 62.9% were women. The weighted 
      3-year risk difference for MACE was 8.2% (95% CI, -0.2% to 16.7%), with a 
      weighted 3-year risk ratio of 1.36 (CI, 0.99 to 1.87). The weighted 3-year risk 
      difference for composite fractures was -5.3% (CI, -11.3% to -0.6%), and the 
      weighted 3-year risk ratio was 0.55 (CI, 0.28 to 0.93). LIMITATIONS: Lack of 
      clinical data on kidney or osteoporosis disease severity and cardiovascular or 
      other metabolic risk with residual confounding. Safety outcomes did not include 
      kidney end points. CONCLUSION: It was estimated that, compared with oral 
      bisphosphonates, denosumab lowered the risk for fractures by 45% and increased 
      the risk for MACE by 36%. The estimates, however, are imprecise and need to be 
      confirmed in future studies. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

TI  - The Effect of Denosumab on Risk for Emergently Treated Hypocalcemia by Stage of 
      Chronic Kidney Disease : A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.7326/M24-0013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on treatment of osteoporosis in patients 
      with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk for 
      emergently treated hypocalcemia with denosumab by stage of CKD and presence of 
      CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). DESIGN: Target trial emulation. SETTING: 
      Medicare fee-for-service data with prescription drug coverage, 2012 to 2020. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Female patients aged 65 years or older initiating denosumab, oral 
      bisphosphonates, or intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates for osteoporosis. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Hospital and emergency department admissions (that is, emergent 
      care) for hypocalcemia were assessed in the first 12 treatment weeks. Inverse 
      probability of treatment weighted cumulative incidence and weighted risk 
      differences (RDs) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 361 453 patients treated 
      with denosumab, 829 044 treated with oral bisphosphonates, and 160 413 treated 
      with IV bisphosphonates were identified. Risk for emergently treated hypocalcemia 
      with denosumab versus oral bisphosphonates increased with worsening CKD stage 
      (P < 0.001), with greatest risk among dialysis-dependent (DD) patients (3.01% vs. 
      0.00%; RD, 3.01% [95% CI, 2.27% to 3.77%]) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) 
      patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 (0.57% vs. 0.03%; RD, 0.54% [CI, 0.41% to 
      0.68%]). Among patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD (NDD + DD), denosumab had a 
      greater risk for emergently treated hypocalcemia versus oral bisphosphonates in 
      those with CKD-MBD (1.53% vs. 0.02%; RD, 1.51% [CI, 1.21% to 1.78%]) than in 
      those without CKD-MBD (0.22% vs. 0.03%; RD, 0.19% [CI, 0.08% to 0.31%]). 
      Denosumab also showed increased risk compared with IV bisphosphonates. 
      LIMITATION: Generalizability to men and non-Medicare populations. CONCLUSION: 
      Risk for emergently treated hypocalcemia with denosumab increased with worsening 
      CKD stage and was highest in DD patients and those with CKD-MBD. PRIMARY FUNDING

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of combination therapy with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 
      remdesivir versus monotherapy with remdesivir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in 
      patients hospitalised with COVID-19: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 1213-1224
LID - S1473-3099(24)00353-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00353-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir (Veklury, Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA) and 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) were reported to 
      improve the outcome of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. 
      Preclinical data suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir might be more effective than 
      remdesivir alone or in combination with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for people at high 
      risk of severe COVID-19. We aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of 
      combining remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared with using each drug 
      alone for adults hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS: In this target trial 
      emulation study, we used electronic health records of patients aged 18 years or 
      older who received either combination treatment of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 
      remdesivir or monotherapy of either drug between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, 
      within 5 days of hospitalisation for COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Inverse probability 
      of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline patient characteristics 
      across the treatment groups. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox 
      proportional hazards regression adjusting weighting was used to compare the risk 
      of all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or ventilatory 
      support for 90 days of follow-up between groups. FINDINGS: Between March 16 and 
      Dec 31, 2022, 18 196 participants were identified from electronic health records 
      and assigned to receive remdesivir (n=4232), nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=13 656), 
      or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir (n=308). By applying an inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting, a weighted sample composed of 18 410 
      recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination treatment, 18 178 
      recipients of remdesivir monotherapy, and 18 287 recipients of 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was obtained. After a median follow-up of 84 
      days (IQR 45-90), risk of mortality was lower in patients who received 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0·18 [95% CI 0·15 to 0·20]; 
      absolute risk reduction [ARR] -16·33% [95% CI -16·98 to -15·68]) or remdesivir 
      and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir combination therapy (HR 0·66 [95% CI 0·49 to 0·89]; 
      ARR -6·52% [95% CI -7·29 to -5·74]) than in patients who received remdesivir 
      monotherapy. Similar results were observed for ICU admission or ventilatory 
      support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy: HR 0·09 [95% CI 0·07 to 0·11]; ARR 
      -10·04% [95% CI -10·53 to -9·56]; combination therapy: HR 0·68 [95% CI 0·42 to 
      1·12]; ARR -3·24% [95% CI -3·84 to -2·64]). Compared with combination therapy, 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was associated with lower risk of mortality 
      (HR 0·27 [95% CI 0·20 to 0·37]; ARR -9·81% [95% CI -10·39 to -9·24]) and ICU 
      admission or ventilatory support (HR 0·13 [95% CI 0·08 to 0·22]; ARR -6·80% [95% 
      CI -7·22 to -6·39]). INTERPRETATION: Our study highlighted the potential for 
      reduced risk of mortality, ICU admission, or the need for ventilatory support in 
      patients hospitalised with COVID-19 treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir as a 
      monotherapy compared with treatment regimens based on nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 
      remdesivir combination therapy or remdesivir monotherapy. Further randomised 
      controlled trials are needed to support the validity of the current results.

TI  - Islet-after-kidney transplantation versus kidney alone in kidney transplant 
      recipients with type 1 diabetes (KAIAK): a population-based target trial 
      emulation in France.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Islet transplantation has been associated with better metabolic 
      control and quality of life than insulin treatment alone, but direct evidence of 
      its effect on hard clinical endpoints is scarce. We aimed to assess the effect of 
      islet transplantation on patient-graft survival in kidney transplant recipients 
      with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 
      all patients with type 1 diabetes who received a kidney graft in France during 
      the study period, identified from the CRISTAL nationwide registry. Non-inclusion 
      criteria included recipients from transplant centres that never proposed islet 
      transplantation during the study period, recipients with a functional pancreas 
      throughout the follow-up duration, recipients with more than two kidney 
      transplants, HLA-sensitised recipients, recipients with less than 1 year of 
      follow-up after kidney transplantation, misclassified recipients with type 2 
      diabetes, recipients aged over 65 years, recipients of kidney grafts from 
      Donation after Circulatory Death donors, recipient with HIV or hepatitis, 
      recipients with cancer, and recipients of combined liver-kidney transplants. 
      Patients who also received islet-after-kidney (IAK) transplantation were compared 
      with controls who received kidney transplantation alone according to a 1:2 
      matching method based on time-dependent propensity scores, ensuring patients 
      comparability at the time of islet transplantation. The primary outcome was 
      patient-graft survival, a composite outcome defined by death, re-transplantation, 
      or return to dialysis. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017, 2391 
      patients with type 1 diabetes were identified as having received a kidney 
      transplant, 47 patients of whom also received an islet transplantation. 2002 
      patients were not eligible for islet transplantation and 62 were excluded due to 
      missing data. 327 eligible recipients from 15 centres were included in the study 
      dataset for the target trial emulation. 40 patients who received IAK 
      transplantation were successfully matched to 80 patients who received kidney 
      transplantation alone. 13 (33%) of 40 patients in the IAK transplantation group 
      returned to dialysis or died, compared with 36 (45%) of 80 patients in the kidney 
      transplantation alone group. We found a significant benefit of islet 
      transplantation compared with kidney transplantation alone on patient-graft 
      survival, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·44 (95% CI 0·23-0·88; p=0·022), mainly 
      explained by a protective effect on the risk of death (HR 0·41, 0·13-0·91; 
      p=0·042). There was no meaningful association between IAK and death-censored 
      graft survival (0·73, 0·30-1·89; p=0·36). INTERPRETATION: In kidney transplant 
      recipients with type 1 diabetes, IAK transplantation was associated with a 
      significantly better patient-graft survival compared with kidney transplantation 
      alone, mainly due to a protective effect on the risk of death. These results 
      potentially serve as compelling grounds for advocating wider access to islet 
      transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing kidney transplant, as 
      reimbursement of islet transplantation is provided in few countries worldwide.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors and the Risk for Dialysis and 
      Cardiovascular Disease in Patients With Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 693-700
LID - 10.7326/M23-1874 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No studies have reported the long-term outcomes of initiating 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in patients with estimated 
      glomerular filtration rates less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to predialysis. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk for dialysis, cardiovascular events, and death 
      between SGLT2i users and nonusers in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 
      stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN: Target trial emulation study. 
      SETTING: Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). 
      PARTICIPANTS: By applying sequential target trial emulation principle, 23 854 
      SGLT2i users and 23 892 SGLT2i nonusers were selected from the NHIRD for patients 
      with T2D and stage 5 CKD from 1 May 2016 to 31 October 2021. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Conditional Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risks for 
      dialysis, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 
      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute kidney injury (AKI), and all-cause mortality 
      between SGLT2i users and nonusers. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat model, 
      compared with no SGLT2i use, SGLT2i use was associated with lower risks for 
      dialysis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34 [95% CI, 0.27 to 0.43]), hospitalization for 
      heart failure (HR, 0.80 [CI, 0.73 to 0.86]), AMI (HR, 0.61 [CI, 0.52 to 0.73]), 
      DKA (HR, 0.78 [CI, 0.71 to 0.85]), and AKI (HR, 0.80 [CI, 0.70 to 0.90]), but 
      there was no difference in the risk for all-cause mortality (HR, 1.11 [CI, 0.99 
      to 1.24]). The Kaplan-Meier curves and subgroup analyses also showed that 
      initiation of an SGLT2i in stage 5 CKD was associated with a lower risk for 
      long-term dialysis than no SGLT2i use. LIMITATION: This result may not apply to 
      patients without T2D. CONCLUSION: This emulated target trial showed that SGLT2i 
      use was associated with a lower risk for dialysis, cardiovascular events, DKA, 
      and AKI than no SGLT2i use in patients with T2D and stage 5 CKD. PRIMARY FUNDING

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To quantify the ability of two new comorbidity indices to adjust for 
      confounding, by benchmarking a target trial emulation against the randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) result. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study 
      including 18,316 men from Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 5.0, diagnosed with 
      prostate cancer between 2008 and 2019 and treated with primary radical 
      prostatectomy (RP, n = 14,379) or radiotherapy (RT, n = 3,937). The effect on 
      adjusted risk of death from any cause after adjustment for comorbidity by use of 
      two new comorbidity indices, the multidimensional diagnosis-based comorbidity 
      index and the drug comorbidity index, were compared to adjustment for the 
      Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). RESULTS: Risk of death was higher after RT than 
      RP (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70-2.21). The 
      difference decreased when adjusting for age, cancer characteristics, and CCI 
      (HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06-1.66). Adjustment for the two new comorbidity indices 
      further attenuated the difference (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91-1.44). Emulation of a 
      hypothetical pragmatic trial where also older men with any type of baseline 
      comorbidity were included, largely confirmed these results (HR 1.10; 95% CI 
      0.95-1.26). CONCLUSION: Adjustment for comorbidity using two new indices provided 
      comparable risk of death from any cause in line with results of a RCT. Similar 
      results were seen in a broader study population, more representative of clinical 
      practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-world observational data are an important source of evidence on 
      the treatment effectiveness for patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19). However, observational studies evaluating treatment 
      effectiveness based on longitudinal data are often prone to methodological biases 
      such as immortal time bias, confounding bias, and competing risks. METHODS: For 
      exemplary target trial emulation, we used a cohort of patients hospitalized with 
      COVID-19 (n = 501) in a single centre. We described the methodology for 
      evaluating the effectiveness of a single-dose treatment, emulated a trial using 
      real-world data, and drafted a hypothetical study protocol describing the main 
      components. To avoid immortal time and time-fixed confounding biases, we applied 
      the clone-censor-weight technique. We set a 5-day grace period as a period of 
      time when treatment could be initiated. We used the inverse probability of 
      censoring weights to account for the selection bias introduced by artificial 
      censoring. To estimate the treatment effects, we took the multi-state model 
      approach. We considered a multi-state model with five states. The primary 
      endpoint was defined as clinical severity status, assessed by a 5-point ordinal 
      scale on day 30. Differences between the treatment group and standard of care 
      treatment group were calculated using a proportional odds model and shown as odds 
      ratios. Additionally, the weighted cause-specific hazards and transition 
      probabilities for each treatment arm were presented. RESULTS: Our study 
      demonstrates that trial emulation with a multi-state model analysis is a suitable 
      approach to address observational data limitations, evaluate treatment effects on 
      clinically heterogeneous in-hospital death and discharge alive endpoints, and 
      consider the intermediate state of admission to ICU. The multi-state model 
      analysis allows us to summarize results using stacked probability plots that make 
      it easier to interpret results. CONCLUSIONS: Extending the emulated target trial 
      approach to multi-state model analysis complements treatment effectiveness 
      analysis by gaining information on competing events. Combining two methodologies 
      offers an option to address immortal time bias, confounding bias, and competing 
      risk events. This methodological approach can provide additional insight for 
      decision-making, particularly when data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      are unavailable.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Fludrocortisone and Hydrocortisone vs Hydrocortisone 
      Alone Among Patients With Septic Shock.
PG  - 451-459
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.0258 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Patients with septic shock may benefit from the initiation of 
      corticosteroids. However, the comparative effectiveness of the 2 most studied 
      corticosteroid regimens (hydrocortisone with fludrocortisone vs hydrocortisone 
      alone) is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of adding 
      fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone vs hydrocortisone alone among patients with 
      septic shock using target trial emulation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This retrospective cohort study from 2016 to 2020 used the enhanced claims-based 
      Premier Healthcare Database, which included approximately 25% of US 
      hospitalizations. Participants were adult patients hospitalized with septic shock 
      and receiving norepinephrine who began hydrocortisone treatment. Data analysis 
      was performed from May 2022 to December 2022. EXPOSURE: Addition of 
      fludrocortisone on the same calendar day that hydrocortisone treatment was 
      initiated vs use of hydrocortisone alone. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Composite of 
      hospital death or discharge to hospice. Adjusted risk differences were calculated 
      using doubly robust targeted maximum likelihood estimation. RESULTS: Analyses 
      included 88 275 patients, 2280 who began treatment with 
      hydrocortisone-fludrocortisone (median [IQR] age, 64 [54-73] years; 1041 female; 
      1239 male) and 85 995 (median [IQR] age, 67 [57-76] years; 42 136 female; 43 859 
      male) who began treatment with hydrocortisone alone. The primary composite 
      outcome of death in hospital or discharge to hospice occurred among 1076 (47.2%) 
      patients treated with hydrocortisone-fludrocortisone vs 43 669 (50.8%) treated 
      with hydrocortisone alone (adjusted absolute risk difference, -3.7%; 95% CI, 
      -4.2% to -3.1%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative 
      effectiveness cohort study among adult patients with septic shock who began 
      hydrocortisone treatment, the addition of fludrocortisone was superior to 
      hydrocortisone alone.

TI  - [Designing observational studies by target trial emulation].
LID - D7702 [pii]
AB  - Ideally, causal research questions will be answered with randomized trials, but 
      this is not always feasible for practical, ethical, or methodological reasons. To 
      obtain a reliable answer to causal questions with observational data, target 
      trial emulation has been introduced, in which an observational study is designed, 
      conducted, and analyzed emulating the target trial. After phrasing a causal 
      question, this framework first addresses seven components of the target trial 
      protocol: eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, assignment procedures, 
      follow-up period, outcome of interest, causal contrast of interest, and 
      statistical analysis plan. Subsequently, these elements are emulated in the 
      observational study. This approach addresses methodological pitfalls before 
      initiating the study, draws more unambiguous conclusions, and provides a 
      structured assessment of limitations of observational studies as well as 
      randomized trials. The use of the target trial framework to support the design of 
      observational studies is increasing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between preconception 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
      (25(OH)D) levels and biomarkers in female and male partners on live birth (LB), 
      pregnancy loss, and semen quality. DESIGN: Secondary analysis using the folic 
      acid and zinc supplementation trial of couples seeking infertility treatment at 
      four US centers (2013-2017). A target trial emulation framework was applied to 
      estimate associations. Couples were observed for 9 months or through pregnancy. 
      SUBJECTS: Couples seeking infertility treatment. INTERVENTION(S): Preconception 
      concentrations of 25(OH)D (primary) and associated biomarkers: vitamin D binding 
      protein, calcium, free vitamin D, bioavailable vitamin D. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE(S): Live birth and pregnancy loss were ascertained via self-report and 
      medical records. Semen quality was ascertained 6 months after enrollment. 
      Log-binomial regression estimated risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
      Individual and joint models and effect measure modification by preconception body 
      mass index were considered. RESULT(S): Among 2,370 couples, 19.5% of females and 
      29.9% of males were 25(OH)D deficient. Females with sufficient status had a 
      28%-higher likelihood of LB than deficient females (95% CI, 1.05-1.56). Female 
      and male 25(OH)D status were associated with LB among those with normal body mass 
      index (sufficient vs. deficient: female adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.39; 95% CI, 
      1.00-1.99; male aRR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.25) and among obese female partners 
      (sufficient vs. deficient: aRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.95-1.85). Couples whose both 
      partners had higher 25(OH)D status had increased likelihood of LB (both not 
      deficient vs. both deficient aRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00-1.58). No associations were 
      observed with pregnancy loss or semen quality. Similar results were found for all 
      biomarkers except calcium. CONCLUSION(S): Preconception vitamin D status and 
      bioavailability impact fertility among couples seeking infertility therapy, 
      likely unrelated to semen quality. Body mass index stratified analyses 
      demonstrated heterogeneous associations. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Target trial emulation to assess real-world efficacy in the Epidemiological 
      Strategy and Medical Economics metastatic breast cancer cohort.
PG  - 971-980
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djad092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-world data studies usually consider biases related to measured 
      confounders. We emulate a target trial implementing study design principles of 
      randomized trials to observational studies; controlling biases related to 
      selection, especially immortal time; and measured confounders. METHODS: This 
      comprehensive analysis emulating a randomized clinical trial compared overall 
      survival in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC), receiving 
      as first-line treatment, either paclitaxel alone or combined to bevacizumab. We 
      used data from 5538 patients extracted from the Epidemiological Strategy and 
      Medical Economics-MBC cohort to emulate a target trial using advanced statistical 
      adjustment techniques including stabilized inverse-probability weighting and 
      G-computation, dealing with missing data with multiple imputation, and performing 
      a quantitative bias analysis for residual bias due to unmeasured confounders. 
      RESULTS: Emulation led to 3211 eligible patients, and overall survival estimates 
      achieved with advanced statistical methods favored the combination therapy. 
      Real-world effect sizes were close to that assessed in the existing E2100 
      randomized clinical trial (hazard ratio = 0.88, P = .16), but the increased 
      sample size allowed to achieve a higher level of precision in real-world 
      estimates (ie, reduced confidence intervals). Quantitative bias analysis 
      confirmed the robustness of the results with respect to potential unmeasured 
      confounding. CONCLUSION: Target trial emulation with advanced statistical 
      adjustment techniques is a promising approach to investigate long-term impact of 
      innovative therapies in the French Epidemiological Strategy and Medical 
      Economics-MBC cohort while minimizing biases and provides opportunities for 
      comparative efficacy through the synthetic control arms provided. DATABASE

TI  - Target Trial Emulation and Bias Through Missing Eligibility Data: An Application 
      to a Study of Palivizumab for the Prevention of Hospitalization Due to Infant 
      Respiratory Illness.
PG  - 600-611
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwac202 [doi]
AB  - Target trial emulation (TTE) applies the principles of randomized controlled 
      trials to the causal analysis of observational data sets. One challenge that is 
      rarely considered in TTE is the sources of bias that may arise if the variables 
      involved in the definition of eligibility for the trial are missing. We highlight 
      patterns of bias that might arise when estimating the causal effect of a point 
      exposure when restricting the target trial to individuals with complete 
      eligibility data. Simulations consider realistic scenarios where the variables 
      affecting eligibility modify the causal effect of the exposure and are missing at 
      random or missing not at random. We discuss means to address these patterns of 
      bias, namely: 1) controlling for the collider bias induced by the missing data on 
      eligibility, and 2) imputing the missing values of the eligibility variables 
      prior to selection into the target trial. Results are compared with the results 
      when TTE is performed ignoring the impact of missing eligibility. A study of 
      palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody recommended for the prevention of respiratory 
      hospital admissions due to respiratory syncytial virus in high-risk infants, is 
      used for illustration.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation: A Concept Simply Explained.
LID - 25f15796 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.25f15796 [doi]
AB  - Target trial emulation (TTE) is an observational, quasi-experimental research 
      design that emulates a randomized clinical trial (RCT) structure within a large 
      set of observational data; the "target trial" is a hypothetical RCT that would 
      have ideally answered the research question. TTEs can address study objectives 
      that, for ethical or logistic reasons, cannot easily be examined in RCTs. 
      Advantages of TTEs over conventional approaches to observational data are that 
      TTEs can reduce bias, improve the understanding of findings, and facilitate 
      causal inference. This article explains what TTEs are, how TTEs are performed, 
      and how TTEs differ from observational studies, quasi controlled studies, and 
      RCTs. Prevalent user bias and immortal time bias are explained, as is how TTEs 
      are designed to avoid these biases. Strengths and limitations of TTEs are 
      discussed. This article also presents 2 recent studies: one, comprising 3 TTEs 
      that examined scholastic outcomes in children gestationally exposed to 
      benzodiazepines and z-drugs in different periods during pregnancy; and the other, 
      a TTE that examined manic switch as an outcome in bipolar depression patients who 
      received antidepressant treatment. The TTEs found that early, mid, or late 
      pregnancy exposure to benzodiazepines or z-drugs was not associated with 
      impairment in fifth-grade numeracy and literacy performance; and that, in 
      patients with bipolar depression, antidepressant drugs (with or without 
      concurrent mood stabilizers) did not increase the 1-year risk of hypomania, 
      mania, or mixed episodes, nor did they reduce the risk of recurrence of bipolar 
      depression. The TTEs that yielded these results had limitations, and so these 
      findings are suggestive, not definitive. As a general conclusion, TTEs may be 
      viewed as pragmatic, naturalistic, real-world emulations of RCTs, with some 
      advantages over conventional observational studies, but they cannot drive causal 
      inference.

TI  - Multicenter target trial emulation to evaluate corticosteroids for sepsis 
      stratified by predicted organ dysfunction trajectory.
PG  - 4450
LID - 10.1038/s41467-025-59643-z [doi]
LID - 4450
AB  - Corticosteroids decrease the duration of organ dysfunction in sepsis and a range 
      of overlapping and complementary infectious critical illnesses, including septic 
      shock, pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The risk and 
      benefit of corticosteroids are not fully defined using the construct of organ 
      dysfunction duration. This retrospective multicenter, proof-of-concept study 
      aimed to evaluate the association between usage of corticosteroids and mortality 
      of patients with sepsis, pneumonia and ARDS by emulating a target trial framework 
      stratified by predicted organ dysfunction trajectory. The study employed a two 
      staged machine learning (ML) methodology to first subphenotype based on organ 
      dysfunction trajectory then predict this defined trajectory. Once patients were 
      classified by predicted trajectory we conducted a target trial emulation. Our 
      analysis revealed that the association between corticosteroid use and 28-day 
      mortality varied by predicted trajectory and between cohorts.Our findings suggest 
      that matching treatment strategies to empirically observed pathobiology may offer 
      a more nuanced understanding of corticosteroid utility.

TI  - Improving rheumatoid arthritis comparative effectiveness research through causal 
      inference principles: systematic review using a target trial emulation framework.
PG  - 883-890
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217200 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Target trial emulation is an intuitive design framework that 
      encourages investigators to formulate their comparative effectiveness research 
      (CER) question as a hypothetical randomised controlled trial (RCT). Our aim was 
      to systematically review CER studies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to provide 
      examples of design limitations that could be avoided using target trial 
      emulation, and how these limitations might introduce bias. METHODS: We searched 
      for head-to-head CER studies of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
      (DMARDs) in RA. Study designs were reviewed for seven components of the target 
      trial emulation framework: eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, assignment 
      procedures, follow-up period, outcome, causal contrasts of interest (ie, 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) or per-protocol effect) and analysis plan. Hypothetical 
      trials corresponding to the reported methods were assessed to identify design 
      limitations that would have been avoided with an explicit target trial protocol. 
      Analysis of the primary effectiveness outcome was chosen where multiple analyses 
      were performed. RESULTS: We found 31 CER studies, of which 29 (94%) had at least 
      one design limitation belonging to seven components. The most common limitations 
      related to: (1) eligibility criteria: 19/31 (61%) studies used post-baseline 
      information to define baseline eligibility; (2) causal contrasts: 25 (81%) did 
      not define whether ITT or per-protocol effects were estimated and (3) assignment 
      procedures: 13 (42%) studies did not account for confounding by indication or 
      relied solely on statistical confounder selection. CONCLUSIONS: Design 
      limitations were found in 94% of observational CER studies in RA. Target trial 
      emulation is a structured approach for designing observational CER studies that 
      helps to avoid potential sources of bias.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Atorvastatin Versus Rosuvastatin : A 
      Multi-database Cohort Study.
PG  - 1641-1651
LID - 10.7326/M24-0178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin are the most widely prescribed 
      moderate- to high-intensity statins. However, evidence on their efficacy and 
      safety during actual use is limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare the real-world 
      effectiveness and safety of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. DESIGN: Active 
      comparator cohort study using target trial emulation. SETTING: The China Renal 
      Data System (CRDS) and UK Biobank (UKB) databases. PARTICIPANTS: Adults newly 
      prescribed rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was 
      all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used after 1:1 
      multilevel propensity score matching. RESULTS: Among the 285 680 eligible 
      participants in both databases, 6-year all-cause mortality was lower for 
      rosuvastatin than for atorvastatin (2.57 vs. 2.83 per 100 person-years in the 
      CRDS database and 0.66 vs. 0.90 per 100 person-years in the UKB database), with 
      differences in cumulative incidence of -1.03% (95% CI, -1.44% to -0.46%) in the 
      CRDS database and -1.38% (CI, -2.50% to -0.21%) in the UKB database. For 
      secondary outcomes in both databases, rosuvastatin conferred lower risks for 
      major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse liver outcomes. In the UKB 
      database, the risk for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher with 
      rosuvastatin, and the 2 medications carried similar risks for development of 
      chronic kidney disease and other statin-related adverse effects. LIMITATION: 
      Possible residual confounding. CONCLUSION: This study found differences in risks 
      for some important outcomes associated with rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. The 
      differences were relatively small, and many did not meet traditional standards 
      for statistical significance. Further research is needed to understand whether 
      these findings can be used with confidence in clinical practice. PRIMARY FUNDING

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the proven effectiveness of oral antivirals against severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in randomized trials, their clinical 
      reevaluation is vital in the context of widespread immunity and milder prevalent 
      variants. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of oral antivirals for 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study 
      utilized a target trial emulation framework to analyze patients with COVID-19 
      aged 60+ from January to December 2022. Data were obtained from the Korea Disease 
      Control and Prevention Agency and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. 
      The study involved 957,036 patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 
      243,360 treated with molnupiravir, each compared with the matched control groups. 
      Primary outcome was progression to critical COVID-19 requiring advanced 
      respiratory support. Secondary outcomes included progression to severe COVID-19, 
      need for supplemental oxygen, and death within 30 days of the onset of COVID-19. 
      Number needed to treat (NNT) derived from the absolute risk reduction. RESULTS: 
      Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was significantly associated with a reduced risk of severe 
      (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.823; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.803-0.843), 
      critical (aOR, 0.560; 95% CI, 0.503-0.624), and fatal COVID-19 (aOR, 0.694; 95% 
      CI, 0.647-0.744). Similarly, molnupiravir reduced the risk of severe (aOR, 0.895; 
      95% CI, 0.856-0.937), critical (aOR, 0.672; 95% CI, 0.559-0.807), and fatal cases 
      (aOR, 0.679; 95% CI, 0.592-0.779). NNTs for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were 203.71 
      (severe), 1,230.12 (critical), and 691.50 (death); for molnupiravir, they were 
      352.70 (severe), 1,398.62 (critical), and 862.98 (death). Higher effectiveness 
      was associated with older adults, unvaccinated individuals, and the late pandemic 
      phase. CONCLUSION: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir are effective in 
      preventing progression to severe disease in elderly adults with COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE: Carfilzomib, commonly used for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma 
      (RRMM), has been associated with various adverse events in randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs). However, real-world safety data for a more diverse population are 
      needed, as carfilzomib received expedited approval. This study aimed to evaluate 
      carfilzomib's safety in Korea by comparing new users of KRd (carfilzomib, 
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) to Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) using a 
      nationwide administrative claims database. METHODS: The retrospective cohort 
      study utilized target trial emulation, focusing on adverse events in various 
      organ systems similar to the ASPIRE trial. RESULTS: This study included 4,580 
      RRMM patients between 2007 and 2020, and the KRd group showed significantly 
      higher risks of hematologic adverse events (anemia, neutropenia, 
      thrombocytopenia) and some non-hematologic adverse events (cough, hypokalemia, 
      constipation, hypertension, heart failure) compared to the Rd group. Among 
      non-hematologic adverse events, cardiovascular events (heart failure [HR 2.04; 
      95% CI 1.24-3.35], hypertension [HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.15-2.17]) had the highest risk 
      in the KRd group. CONCLUSION: The safety profile of carfilzomib in Korean 
      patients was similar to previous RCTs. Therefore, caution should be exercised 
      when using carfilzomib in Asian individuals with RRMM due to the increased risk 
      of cardiovascular adverse events.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Controversy exists regarding potential cancer risks 
      associated with long-term statin use. This study aimed to use real-world data to 
      investigate the association between cancer incidence and sustained statin use 
      over a 10-year period. METHODS: Using territory-wide public electronic medical 
      records in Hong Kong, we emulated a sequence of nested target trials on patients 
      who met indications for statin initiation in each calendar month from January 
      2009 to December 2011. Statin initiators and noninitiators were matched in a 1:1 
      ratio to mimic the randomization of eligible person-trials at baseline. Pooled 
      logistic regression was applied to obtain the hazard ratios for the cancer 
      incidence of statin initiation in intention-to-treat analysis, with the 
      adjustment of baseline confounders and the inverse probability weighting 
      accounting for the postbaseline confounders in per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: 
      Among 8,560,051 eligible person-trials, 119,715 noninitiators were matched to 
      119,715 initiators for analysis. Over the 10-year study period, the estimated 
      hazard ratio of overall cancer incidence was 0.96 (0.87, 1.05), and the 
      standardized 10-year risk difference was -0.4% (-1.3%, 0.4%) in the per-protocol 
      analysis. For the cancer subtypes of interest (ie, breast cancer, colorectal 
      cancer, hematological cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, urothelial 
      carcinoma, and lung cancer), the 10-year risk differences ranged from -0.3% to 
      0.2% in the per-protocol analysis. No observable risk change for cancer was found 
      in all patient subgroups with regards to their sex, age (<70/≥70 years), Charlson 
      Comorbidity Index (≤4/>4), and statin indication. CONCLUSION: Statin use has no 
      impact on cancer incidence over a 10-year follow-up period, including all cancer 
      subtypes of interest and patient subgroups with regards to sex, age, 
      comorbidities, and statin indications.

AB  - Target trial emulation applies design principles from randomised controlled 
      trials to the analysis of observational data for causal inference and is 
      increasingly used within human epidemiology. Veterinary electronic clinical 
      records represent a potentially valuable source of information to estimate 
      real-world causal effects for companion animal species. This study employed the 
      target trial framework to evaluate the usefulness on veterinary observational 
      data. Acute diarrhoea in dogs was used as a clinical exemplar. Inclusion required 
      dogs aged ≥ 3 months and < 10 years, presenting for veterinary primary care with 
      acute diarrhoea during 2019. Treatment strategies were: 1. antimicrobial 
      prescription compared to no antimicrobial prescription and 2. gastrointestinal 
      nutraceutical prescription compared to no gastrointestinal nutraceutical 
      prescription. The primary outcome was clinical resolution (defined as no revisit 
      with ongoing diarrhoea within 30 days from the date of first presentation). 
      Informed from a directed acyclic graph, data on the following covariates were 
      collected: age, breed, bodyweight, insurance status, comorbidities, vomiting, 
      reduced appetite, haematochezia, pyrexia, duration, additional treatment 
      prescription and veterinary group. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was 
      used to balance covariates between the treatment groups for each of the two 
      target trials. The risk difference (RD) of 0.4% (95% CI -4.5% to 5.3%) was 
      non-significant for clinical resolution in dogs treated with antimicrobials 
      compared with dogs not treated with antimicrobials. The risk difference (RD) of 
      0.3% (95% CI -4.5% to 5.0%) was non-significant for clinical resolution in dogs 
      treated with gastrointestinal nutraceuticals compared with dogs not treated with 
      gastrointestinal nutraceuticals. This study successfully applied the target trial 
      framework to veterinary observational data. The findings show that antimicrobial 
      or gastrointestinal prescription at first presentation of acute diarrhoea in dogs 
      causes no difference in clinical resolution. The findings support the 
      recommendation for veterinary professionals to limit antimicrobial use for acute 
      diarrhoea in dogs.

      cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Post hoc analysis using a target trial 
      emulation framework applied to the immediate post-trial period (2017-2021) of a 
      study of low-dose aspirin initiation in adults aged ≥ 70 years (ASPREE; 
      NCT01038583). Participants from Australia and the USA were included if they were 
      free of CVD at the start of the post-trial intervention period (time zero, T0) 
      and had been taking open-label or randomized aspirin immediately before T0. The 
      two groups in the target trial were as follows: aspirin cessation (participants 
      who were taking randomized aspirin immediately before T0; assumed to have stopped 
      at T0 as instructed) versus aspirin continuation (participants on open-label 
      aspirin at T0 regardless of their randomized treatment; assumed to have continued 
      at T0). The outcomes after T0 were incident CVD, major adverse cardiovascular 
      events (MACE), all-cause mortality, and major bleeding during 3, 6, and 12 months 
      (short-term) and 48 months (long-term) follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) comparing 
      aspirin cessation to continuation were estimated from propensity-score (PS) 
      adjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTS: We included 6103 
      CVD-free participants (cessation: 5427, continuation: 676). Over both short- and 
      long-term follow-up, aspirin cessation versus continuation was not associated 
      with elevated risk of CVD, MACE, and all-cause mortality (HRs, at 3 and 48 months 
      respectively, were 1.23 and 0.73 for CVD, 1.11 and 0.84 for MACE, and 0.23 and 
      0.79 for all-cause mortality, p > 0.05), but cessation had a reduced risk of 
      incident major bleeding events (HRs at 3 and 48 months, 0.16 and 0.63, p < 0.05). 
      Similar findings were seen for all outcomes at 6 and 12 months, except for a 
      lowered risk of all-cause mortality in the cessation group at 12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that deprescribing prophylactic aspirin might 
      be safe in healthy older adults with no known CVD.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation for Transparent and Robust Estimation of Treatment Effects 
      for Health Technology Assessment Using Real-World Data: Opportunities and 
      Challenges.
PG  - 577-586
LID - 10.1007/s40273-022-01141-x [doi]
AB  - Evidence about the relative effects of new treatments is typically collected in 
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In many instances, evidence from RCTs falls 
      short of the needs of health technology assessment (HTA). For example, RCTs may 
      not be able to capture longer-term treatment effects, or include all relevant 
      comparators and outcomes required for HTA purposes. Information routinely 
      collected about patients and the care they receive have been increasingly used to 
      complement RCT evidence on treatment effects. However, such routine (or 
      real-world) data are not collected for research purposes, so investigators have 
      little control over the way patients are selected into the study or allocated to 
      the different treatment groups, introducing biases for example due to selection 
      or confounding. A promising approach to minimise common biases in non-randomised 
      studies that use real-world data (RWD) is to apply design principles from RCTs. 
      This approach, known as 'target trial emulation' (TTE), involves (1) developing 
      the protocol with respect to core study design and analysis components of the 
      hypothetical RCT that would answer the question of interest, and (2) applying 
      this protocol to the RWD so that it mimics the data that would have been gathered 
      for the RCT. By making the 'target trial' explicit, TTE helps avoid common design 
      flaws and methodological pitfalls in the analysis of non-randomised studies, 
      keeping each step transparent and accessible. It provides a coherent framework 
      that embeds existing analytical methods to minimise confounding and helps 
      identify potential limitations of RWD and the extent to which these affect the 
      HTA decision. This paper provides a broad overview of TTE and discusses the 
      opportunities and challenges of using this approach in HTA. We describe the basic 
      principles of trial emulation, outline some areas where TTE using RWD can help 
      complement RCT evidence in HTA, identify potential barriers to its adoption in 
      the HTA setting and highlight some priorities for future work.

TI  - Effect of tecovirimat on healing time and viral clearance by emulation of a 
      target trial in patients hospitalized for mpox.
PG  - e28868
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28868 [doi]
AB  - Tecovirimat is a treatment option for severe mpox, although randomized clinical 
      trials are ongoing. The aim of the study is to assess the effect of tecovirimat 
      on healing time and the extent of viral clearance by target trial emulation using 
      observational data. Clinical and virological data of patients hospitalized for 
      mpox were collected. Samples from the upper respiratory tract (URT) were grouped 
      in two time points: T1 (median 6 days from symptoms onset) and T2 (median 5 days 
      from T1). Patients were followed-up until recovery. Average treatment effect 
      (ATE) in patients untreated versus treated with tecovirimat was estimated on time 
      to healing and variation in viral load in URT, using a weighted and cloning 
      analysis. Among the 41 patients included, 19 completed a course of tecovirimat. 
      The median time from symptoms onset to hospitalization and to drug-starting was 4 
      days and 10 days, respectively. No improvement in healing time in treated versus 
      untreated was observed. No difference by treatment group in time to viral 
      clearance was detected by ATE fitted in a subset of 13 patients after controlling 
      for confounders. We found no evidence for a large effect of tecovirimat in 
      shortening healing time and viral clearance. While awaiting the results of 
      randomized studies, the use of tecovirimat should be restricted to the clinical 
      trial setting.

TI  - Antipsychotic drugs in first-episode psychosis: a target trial emulation in the 
      FEP-CAUSAL Collaboration.
PG  - 1081-1087
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae029 [doi]
AB  - Good adherence to antipsychotic therapy helps prevent relapses in first-episode 
      psychosis (FEP). We used data from the FEP-CAUSAL Collaboration, an international 
      consortium of observational cohorts, to emulate a target trial comparing 
      antipsychotics, with treatment discontinuation as the primary outcome. Other 
      outcomes included all-cause hospitalization. We benchmarked our results to 
      estimates from the European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial, a randomized trial 
      conducted in the 2000s. We included 1097 patients with a psychotic disorder and 
      less than 2 years since psychosis onset. Inverse-probability weighting was used 
      to control for confounding. The estimated 12-month risks of discontinuation for 
      aripiprazole, first-generation agents, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, and 
      risperidone were 61.5% (95% CI, 52.5-70.6), 73.5% (95% CI, 60.5-84.9), 76.8% (95% 
      CI, 67.2-85.3), 58.4% (95% CI, 40.4-77.4), 76.5% (95% CI, 62.1-88.5), and 74.4% 
      (95% CI, 67.0-81.2), respectively. Compared with aripiprazole, the 12-month risk 
      differences were -15.3% (95% CI, -30.0 to 0.0) for olanzapine, -12.8% (95% CI, 
      -25.7 to -1.0) for risperidone, and 3.0% (95% CI, -21.5 to 30.8) for 
      paliperidone. The 12-month risks of hospitalization were similar between agents. 
      Our estimates support use of aripiprazole and paliperidone as first-line 
      therapies for FEP. Benchmarking yielded similar results for discontinuation and 
      absolute risks of hospitalization as in the original trial, suggesting that data 
      from the FEP-CAUSAL Collaboration sufficed to remove confounding for these 
      clinical questions. This article is part of a Special Collection on Mental 
      Health.

AB  - Causal inference methods intended for use with observational data have been 
      widely available for decades, but barriers to their widespread adoption exist. 
      These likely include lack of familiarity with several methodological techniques 
      often used in combination in these investigations, such as inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting and g-estimation, and the intensity of computational effort 
      needed to employ these techniques. Even with these methods, critical design flaws 
      undermine the ability to make valid causal inference in some studies. 
      Identification of the need to explicitly pair study design elements with these 
      causal inference methods led to development of a methodological approach recently 
      termed target trial emulation. This approach requires that investigators define a 
      hypothetical randomized trial, emulate that hypothetical protocol in assembling 
      the cohort and defining study elements, and then conduct an analysis that 
      attempts to mirror random treatment assignment. In the accompanying article by 
      Heindel et al (Am J Epidemiol. 2025;194(3):651-658), the authors successfully 
      emulate a target trial of systemic heparin during arteriovenous fistula creation 
      on short-term endpoints by utilizing data from 2 existing randomized trials with 
      key confounders available. Target trial emulation provides a framework with which 
      to promote valid inference and generate high-quality contributions to the 
      literature, and its use should be expanded.

AB  - Target trial emulation applies design principles from randomised controlled 
      trials to the analysis of observational data for causal inference and is 
      increasingly used within human epidemiology. Using anonymised veterinary clinical 
      data from the VetCompass Programme, this study applied the target trial emulation 
      framework to determine whether surgical (compared to non-surgical) management for 
      cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture in dogs causes improved short- and 
      long-term lameness and analgesia outcomes. The emulated target trial included 
      dogs diagnosed with CCL rupture between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 
      within the VetCompass database. Inclusion in the emulated trial required dogs 
      aged ≥ 1.5 and < 12 years, first diagnosed with unilateral CCL rupture during 
      2019 and with no prior history of contralateral ligament rupture or stifle 
      surgery. Dogs were retrospectively observed to have surgical or non-surgical 
      management. Informed from a directed acyclic graph derived from expert opinion, 
      data on the following variables were collected: age, breed, bodyweight, neuter 
      status, insurance status, non-orthopaedic comorbidities, orthopaedic 
      comorbidities and veterinary group. Inverse probability of treatment weighting 
      (IPTW) was used to adjust for confounding, with weights calculated based on a 
      binary logistic regression exposure model. Censored dogs were accounted for in 
      the IPTW analysis using inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). The 
      IPCWs were combined with IPTWs and used to weight each dog's contribution to 
      binary logistic regression outcome models. Standardized mean differences (SMD) 
      examined the balance of covariate distribution between treatment groups. The 
      emulated trial included 615 surgical CCL rupture cases and 200 non-surgical 
      cases. The risk difference for short-term lameness in surgically managed cases 
      (compared with non-surgically managed cases) was -25.7% (95% confidence interval 
      (CI) -36.7% to -15.9%) and the risk difference for long-term lameness -31.7% (95% 
      CI -37.9% to -18.1%). The study demonstrated the application of the target trial 
      framework to veterinary observational data. The findings show that surgical 
      management causes a reduction in short- and long-term lameness compared with 
      non-surgical management in dogs.

TI  - Effect of early adjunctive vasopressin initiation for septic shock patients: a 
      target trial emulation.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.1186/s13054-025-05401-y [doi]
LID - 188
AB  - BACKGROUND: In septic shock, the optimal timing of adjunctive vasopressin 
      initiation shock is unknown. We aimed to assess the effect of its early 
      initiation for patients with septic shock. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter 
      target trial emulation to estimate the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality effect 
      of early (≤ 6 h) adjunctive vasopressin compared with usual care. Eligible 
      patients had septic shock diagnosed within 6 h of ICU admission. The primary 
      outcome of this study was 30-day ICU mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted 
      to test the interaction of early vasopressin start with peak 
      norepinephrine-equivalent dose (NED) at 6 h, APACHE score, peak lactate at 6 h 
      and invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were the impact of 
      delayed vasopressin introduction on 30-day ICU mortality and effect of NED at 
      vasopressin start on 30-day ICU mortality. We used the parametric g-formula to 
      emulate a target trial. RESULTS: Overall, 3,105 patients fulfilled the inclusion 
      criteria. Mean age was 62 years and mean APACHE III score was 83. In the first 
      six hours of vasopressor therapy, 1,864 (60%) patients were invasively 
      ventilated. Estimated 30-day ICU mortality was 19.34% (95%CI, 17.0 to 21.68) in 
      the no vasopressin group and 18.45% (95%CI, 16.26 to 20.63) in the early 
      vasopressin group; relative risk 0.95 (95%CI, 0.93 to 0.98). The estimated 30-day 
      ICU mortality effect of starting vasopressin was particularly strong at lower 
      norepinephrine doses (< 0.25 µg.kg(-1).min(-1)) and significant at lower 
      norepinephrine doses than recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 
      Guidelines. Vasopressin administration progressively increased over the study 
      period, from 35.2% (95%CI, 30.0 to 40.5) in 2015 to 45.1% (95%CI, 40.7 to 49.6) 
      in 2021 (ß =  + 1.3% per year; 95%CI, + 0.46 to + 2.16, p = 0.011). Patients had 
      progressively lower norepinephrine equivalent dose (ß = - 0.05 µg.kg(-1).min(-1) 
      per year; 95%CI, - 0.09 to - 0.002, p = 0.038) and lower total SOFA score 
      (ß = - 0.1 point per year; 95%CI, - 0.18 to - 0.07, p < 0.001) at vasopressin 
      start. CONCLUSIONS: In this emulation of a hypothetical target trial, patients 
      with septic shock benefited from early vasopressin administration. These findings 
      can help design prospective randomised-control trials of early adjunctive 
      vasopressin use in septic shock.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation Using Cohort Studies: Estimating the Effect of 
      Antihypertensive Medication Initiation on Incident Dementia.
PG  - 48-59
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001802 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies link high midlife systolic blood pressure to 
      increased dementia risk. However, the synthesis of evidence from randomized 
      controlled trials has not definitively demonstrated that antihypertensive 
      medication use reduces dementia risk. Here, we emulate target trials of 
      antihypertensive medication initiation on incident dementia using three cohort 
      studies, with attention to potential violations of necessary assumptions. 
      METHODS: We emulated trials of antihypertensive medication initiation on incident 
      dementia using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, 
      Cardiovascular Health Study, and Health and Retirement Study. We used data-driven 
      methods to restrict participants to initiators and noninitiators with overlap in 
      propensity scores and positive control outcomes to look for violations of 
      positivity and exchangeability assumptions. RESULTS: Analyses were limited by the 
      small number of cohort participants who met eligibility criteria. Associations 
      between antihypertensive medication initiation and incident dementia were 
      inconsistent and imprecise (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities: HR = 0.30 [0.05, 
      1.93]; Cardiovascular Health Study: HR = 0.66 [0.27, 1.64]; Health and Retirement 
      Study: HR = 1.09 [0.75, 1.59]). More stringent propensity score restrictions had 
      little effect on findings. Sensitivity analyses using a positive control outcome 
      unexpectedly suggested antihypertensive medication initiation increased the risk 
      of coronary heart disease in all three samples. CONCLUSIONS: Positive control 
      outcome analyses suggested substantial residual confounding in effect estimates 
      from our target trials, precluding conclusions about the impact of 
      antihypertensive medication initiation on dementia risk through target trial 
      emulation. Formalized processes for identifying violations of necessary 
      assumptions will strengthen confidence in target trial emulation and avoid 
      inappropriate confidence in emulated trial results.

AB  - Clinical trial is the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
      interventions; however, it is limited by high costs and long time. Real-world 
      data (RWD) can provide a robust data basis for comparative research, but the 
      quality is uneven. This review introduces the target trial emulation, in which 
      researchers, using RWD and following the design of clinical trials, define 
      exposure and outcome in advance, set eligibility criteria, determine the time 
      zero, estimate sample size, and plan statistical analysis, to enhance the quality 
      of evidence for observational studies. This review preliminarily discusses the 
      standard of evidence quality evaluation in target trial emulation. Then, the 
      target trial emulation is shown through case interpretation.

TI  - A target trial emulation comparing the antidepressant effectiveness of selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) highlighting the importance of 
      patent-related confounding by indication.
PG  - 198-208
LID - 10.1111/acps.13729 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The comparative effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) has been subjected to relatively little research. However, a 
      recent study based on target trial emulation suggested that sertraline may be 
      more effective than escitalopram. AIMS: To investigate whether sertraline, 
      citalopram, and escitalopram differ in their effectiveness-assessed via the risk 
      of psychiatric hospital admission and suicide following treatment initiation. The 
      choice to focus on sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram was made to limit 
      confounding by indication, as the Danish depression treatment guideline from 2007 
      specifically listed these three SSRIs as first choice. METHOD: We conducted a 
      target trial emulation based on data from Danish registers. We identified all 
      individuals that initiated treatment for depression with sertraline, citalopram, 
      or escitalopram in the period from January 1, 2007, to March 1, 2019. These 
      individuals were followed until psychiatric hospital admission or suicide 
      (separate analyses), death, 1 year after treatment initiation or end of data. Cox 
      proportional hazards regression adjusted for relevant baseline covariates was 
      performed to emulate randomized treatment allocation, comparing the rate of 
      psychiatric hospital admission and suicide for individuals treated with 
      sertraline (used as reference), citalopram or escitalopram, respectively. For 
      escitalopram, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding data from the period 
      during which the drug was sold under patent, as the price of the drug during that 
      time likely entailed a different prescription pattern, increasing the risk of 
      ("patent-related") confounding by indication. RESULTS: We identified 56,865, 
      118,145, and 31,083 individuals initiating treatment with sertraline, citalopram, 
      and escitalopram, respectively. Using sertraline as reference, the adjusted 
      hazard rate ratio (aHRR) for psychiatric admission was 0.98 (95% CI = 0.91-1.05) 
      for citalopram and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.10-1.32) for escitalopram. Notably, in the 
      sensitivity analysis only including patients initiating treatment after the 
      escitalopram patent had expired, the increased risk of psychiatric hospital 
      admission associated with escitalopram treatment was no longer present 
      (aHRR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.82-1.18). The results of the analyses of suicide were 
      inconclusive, due to few outcome events. CONCLUSIONS: Sertraline, citalopram, and 
      escitalopram do not seem to have differential effectiveness in the treatment of 
      depression. Taking potential patent-related, time varying, confounding by 
      indication (via severity) into account is critical for pharmacoepidemiological 
      studies, including those employing target trial emulation.

TI  - Myasthenia gravis following statin therapy: evidence from target trial emulation 
      and self-controlled case series study.

AB  - Several international pharmacovigilance agencies have issued warnings regarding 
      the potential risk of myasthenia gravis (MG) following statin therapy. Our study 
      investigated this association using population-based electronic health records in 
      Hong Kong. We conducted a sequence of target trial emulation (TTE) for 
      interpersonal comparison and a self-controlled case series (SCCS) study for 
      intrapersonal comparison. In the TTE for MG onset, the incidence rates (per 
      100,000 person-years) and adjusted HRs were 51.91(31.80, 84.74)[HR:6.11 (3.73, 
      10.01)] in month 1, 16.27(9.81, 26.99)[HR:1.92(1.15, 3.19) in months 2-4, and 
      15.27(9.05, 25.79)[HR:1.80(1.06, 3.04)] in months 5-7. For risk of exacerbation, 
      the adjusted HRs were 10.69(5.48, 20.84) in month 1, 1.50(0.55, 4.06) in months 
      2-4, and 2.79(1.33, 5.84) in months 5-7. No increased risks were found during the 
      subsequent 18 months. A similar pattern was observed in SCCS analysis. Our 
      findings recommend a minimum monitoring period of approximately six months for MG 
      symptoms for patients starting using statin.

AB  - Target trial emulation (TTE) aims to estimate treatment effects by simulating 
      randomized controlled trials using real-world observational data. Applying TTE 
      across distributed datasets shows great promise in improving generalizability and 
      power but is always infeasible due to privacy and data-sharing constraints. Here 
      we propose a Federated Learning-based TTE framework, FL-TTE, that enables TTE 
      across multiple sites without sharing patient-level data. FL-TTE incorporates 
      federated protocol design, federated inverse probability of treatment weighting, 
      and a federated Cox proportional hazards model to estimate time-to-event outcomes 
      across heterogeneous data. We validated FL-TTE by emulating Sepsis trials using 
      eICU and MIMIC-IV data from 192 hospitals, and Alzheimer's trials using INSIGHT 
      Network across five New York City health systems. FL-TTE produced less biased 
      estimates than traditional meta-analysis methods when compared to pooled results 
      and is theoretically supported. Our FL-TTE enables federated treatment effect 
      estimation across distributed and heterogeneous data in a privacy-preserved way.

TI  - Oxygenation thresholds for invasive ventilation in hypoxemic respiratory failure: 
      a target trial emulation in two cohorts.
PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/s13054-023-04307-x [doi]
LID - 67
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal thresholds for the initiation of invasive ventilation in 
      patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure are unknown. Using the 
      saturation-to-inspired oxygen ratio (SF), we compared lower versus higher 
      hypoxemia severity thresholds for initiating invasive ventilation. METHODS: This 
      target trial emulation included patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
      Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, 2008-2019) and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers 
      (AmsterdamUMCdb, 2003-2016) databases admitted to intensive care and receiving 
      inspired oxygen fraction ≥ 0.4 via non-rebreather mask, noninvasive ventilation, 
      or high-flow nasal cannula. We compared the effect of using invasive ventilation 
      initiation thresholds of SF < 110, < 98, and < 88 on 28-day mortality. MIMIC-IV 
      was used for the primary analysis and AmsterdamUMCdb for the secondary analysis. 
      We obtained posterior means and 95% credible intervals (CrI) with nonparametric 
      Bayesian G-computation. RESULTS: We studied 3,357 patients in the primary 
      analysis. For invasive ventilation initiation thresholds SF < 110, SF < 98, and 
      SF < 88, the predicted 28-day probabilities of invasive ventilation were 72%, 
      47%, and 19%. Predicted 28-day mortality was lowest with threshold SF < 110 
      (22.2%, CrI 19.2 to 25.0), compared to SF < 98 (absolute risk increase 1.6%, CrI 
      0.6 to 2.6) or SF < 88 (absolute risk increase 3.5%, CrI 1.4 to 5.4). In the 
      secondary analysis (1,279 patients), the predicted 28-day probability of invasive 
      ventilation was 50% for initiation threshold SF < 110, 28% for SF < 98, and 19% 
      for SF < 88. In contrast with the primary analysis, predicted mortality was 
      highest with threshold SF < 110 (14.6%, CrI 7.7 to 22.3), compared to SF < 98 
      (absolute risk decrease 0.5%, CrI 0.0 to 0.9) or SF < 88 (absolute risk decrease 
      1.9%, CrI 0.9 to 2.8). CONCLUSION: Initiating invasive ventilation at lower 
      hypoxemia severity will increase the rate of invasive ventilation, but this can 
      either increase or decrease the expected mortality, with the direction of effect 
      likely depending on baseline mortality risk and clinical context.

PG  - 107-114
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001808 [doi]
AB  - Immortal time may arise in survival analyses when individuals are assigned to 
      treatment strategies based on post-eligibility information or selected based on 
      post-assignment eligibility criteria. Selection based on eligibility criteria 
      applied after treatment assignment results in immortal time when the analysis 
      starts the follow-up at assignment. Misclassification of assignment to treatment 
      strategies based on treatment received after eligibility results in immortal time 
      when the treatment strategies are not distinguishable at the start of follow-up. 
      Target trial emulation prevents the introduction of immortal time by explicitly 
      specifying eligibility and assignment to the treatment strategies, and by 
      synchronizing them at the start of follow-up. We summarize analytic approaches 
      that prevent immortal time when longitudinal data are available to emulate the 
      target trial from the time of treatment assignment. The term "immortal time bias" 
      suggests that the source of the bias is the immortal time, but it is selection or 
      misclassification that generates the immortal time, leading to bias.

TI  - Identifying Veterans Who Benefit From Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir: A Target Trial 
      Emulation.
PG  - 643-651
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciae202 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is recommended for persons at risk for severe 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but remains underutilized. Information on 
      which eligible groups are likely to benefit from treatment is needed. METHODS: We 
      conducted a target trial emulation study in the Veterans Health Administration 
      comparing nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treated versus matched untreated veterans at 
      risk for severe COVID-19 who tested positive for severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from April 2022 through March 2023. We 
      measured incidence of any hospitalization or all-cause mortality at 30 days. 
      Outcomes were measured for the entire cohort, as well as among subgroups defined 
      by 30-day risk of death or hospitalization, estimated using an ensemble risk 
      prediction model. RESULTS: Participants were 87% male with median age 66 years 
      and 16% unvaccinated. Compared with matched untreated participants, those treated 
      with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 24 205) had a lower 30-day risk for 
      hospitalization (1.80% vs 2.30%; risk difference [RD], -0.50% points [95% 
      confidence interval {CI}: -.69 to -.35]) and death (0.11% vs 0.30%; RD, -0.20 
      [95% CI: -.24 to -.13]). The greatest reductions in combined hospitalization or 
      death were observed in the highest risk quartile (RD -2.85 [95% CI: -3.94 to 
      -1.76]), immunocompromised persons (RD -1.91 [95% CI: -3.09 to -.74]), and 
      persons aged ≥75 years (RD -1.16 [95% CI: -1.73 to -.59]). No reductions were 
      observed in the 2 lowest risk quartiles or persons younger than 65 years. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was effective in reducing 30-day 
      hospitalization and death in older veterans, those at highest predicted risk for 
      severe outcomes, and immunocompromised groups. Benefit was not observed in 
      younger veterans or groups at lower predicted risk for hospitalization and death.

TI  - Target trial emulation for comparative effectiveness research with observational 
      data: Promise and challenges for studying medications for opioid use disorder.
PG  - 1313-1321
LID - 10.1111/add.16473 [doi]
AB  - Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) increase retention in care and 
      decrease mortality during active treatment; however, information about the 
      comparative effectiveness of different forms of MOUD is sparse. Observational 
      comparative effectiveness studies are subject to many types of bias; a robust 
      framework to minimize bias would improve the quality of comparative effectiveness 
      evidence. This paper discusses the use of target trial emulation as a framework 
      to conduct comparative effectiveness studies of MOUD with administrative data. 
      Using examples from our planned research project comparing buprenorphine-naloxone 
      and extended-release naltrexone with respect to the rates of MOUD 
      discontinuation, we provide a primer on the challenges and approaches to 
      employing target trial emulation in the study of MOUD.

AB  - Little is known about the long-term effectiveness of risk-based treat-to-target 
      cholesterol-lowering interventions on cardiovascular risk. Here, we show the 
      emulated effectiveness of guideline-recommended low-density and non-high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering interventions using the absolute risk reduction 
      (ARR) and the restricted mean event-free time-based number needed to treat (NNT). 
      With 5,375 participants, the 29-year risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
      all-cause mortality, and atherosclerotic CVD were 18.6%, 25.6%, and 17.7%, 
      respectively. Long-term treat-to-target interventions showed significant 
      reductions in CVD (ARR -2.3%, 95%CI -3.4% to -0.8%; NNT 115), all-cause mortality 
      (-3.0%, -4.3% to -1.8%; 95), and atherosclerotic CVD (-2.6%, -3.5% to -1.2%; 
      104). Such effects appear more pronounced in women, smokers, and those with body 
      mass index < 24 kg/m² or higher adherence rates.

TI  - Target trial emulation to evaluate the effect of immune-related adverse events on 
      outcomes in metastatic urothelial cancer.
PG  - 30

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are an important therapeutic 
      pillar in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). The occurrence of immune-related 
      adverse events (irAEs) appears to be associated with improved outcomes in 
      observational studies. However, these associations are likely affected by 
      immortal time bias and do not represent causal effects. The aim of this study was 
      to assess the effect of irAEs on outcomes while correcting for immortal time 
      bias, using target trial emulation (TTE). METHODS: TTE was contrasted to adjusted 
      naïve and time-updated Cox models. We performed a multi-institutional 
      retrospective study involving mUC patients under ICI. The primary objective was 
      to assess the impact of irAEs on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
      survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included the influence of irAEs on objective 
      response rates (ORRs) to ICI and the influence of systemic corticosteroids on 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Among 335 patients (median age: 69 yrs), 69.6% received ICI in 
      the second line or further lines. During a median follow-up of 21.1 months, 122 
      (36.4%) patients developed irAEs of any grade (grade ≥ 3: 14.9%). Hazard ratios 
      (HRs) for PFS ranged from 0.37 for naïve adjusted Cox model to 0.88 (95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 0.59-1.30) with time-updated covariates, and from 0.41 
      to 1.10 (95% CI, 0.69-1.75) for OS. TTE accounting for immortal time bias yielded 
      a HR of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.72-1.44) for PFS, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.62-1.30) for OS. In 
      contrast to the naïve Cox model (HR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.26-4.05), the presence of 
      irAEs was no longer a predictive factor for improved ORR in time-updated Cox 
      models (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.68-2.36) and TTE (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 0.89-2.29). In 
      patients with irAEs, systemic corticosteroids did not negatively impact survival. 
      CONCLUSION: Using TTE, we were able to show that the occurrence of irAEs is no 
      longer associated with better survival or improved response rates to ICI in mUC 
      patients, in contrast to the naïve analysis. These findings demonstrate that TTE 
      is a suitable formal framework to avoid immortal time bias in studies with 
      time-dependent non-interventional exposures.

TI  - Comparison of a Target Trial Emulation Framework to Cox Regression to Estimate 
      the Effect of Corticosteroids on COVID-19 Mortality.
LID - 2022.05.27.22275037 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2022.05.27.22275037 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Communication and adoption of modern study design and analytical 
      techniques is of high importance for the improvement of clinical research from 
      observational data. OBJECTIVE: To compare (1) a modern method for causal 
      inference including a target trial emulation framework and doubly robust 
      estimation to (2) approaches common in the clinical literature such as Cox 
      proportional hazards models. To do this, we estimate the effect of 
      corticosteroids on mortality for moderate-to-severe coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) patients. We use the World Health Organization's (WHO) meta-analysis 
      of corticosteroid randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as a benchmark. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study using longitudinal electronic health record data for 
      28 days from time of hospitalization. SETTINGS: Multi-center New York City 
      hospital system. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients hospitalized between March 1-May 
      15, 2020 with COVID-19 and not on corticosteroids for chronic use. INTERVENTION: 
      Corticosteroid exposure defined as >0.5mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent in a 
      24-hour period. For target trial emulation, interventions are (1) corticosteroids 
      for six days if and when patient meets criteria for severe hypoxia and (2) no 
      corticosteroids. For approaches common in clinical literature, treatment 
      definitions used for variables in Cox regression models vary by study design (no 
      time frame, one-, and five-days from time of severe hypoxia). MAIN OUTCOME: 
      28-day mortality from time of hospitalization. RESULTS: 3,298 patients (median 
      age 65 (IQR 53-77), 60% male). 423 receive corticosteroids at any point during 
      hospitalization, 699 die within 28 days of hospitalization. Target trial 
      emulation estimates corticosteroids to reduce 28-day mortality from 32.2% (95% CI 
      30.9-33.5) to 25.7% (24.5-26.9). This estimate is qualitatively identical to the 
      WHO's RCT meta-analysis odds ratio of 0.66 (0.53-0.82)). Hazard ratios using 
      methods comparable to current corticosteroid research range in size and direction 
      from 0.50 (0.41-0.62) to 1.08 (0.80-1.47). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Clinical 
      research based on observational data can unveil true causal relationships; 
      however, the correctness of these effect estimates requires designing the study 
      and analyzing the data based on principles which are different from the current 
      standard in clinical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no real-world evidence regarding the association between 
      beta-blocker use and mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with 
      obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We aimed to investigate the impact of 
      beta-blocker use on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in 
      patients with OSA. METHODS: We conducted a target trial emulation study of 37,581 
      patients with newly diagnosed OSA from 1st January 2000 to 30th November 2021 
      using the IMRD-UK database (formerly known as the THIN database). We compared the 
      treatment strategies of initiating beta-blocker treatment within one year versus 
      non-beta-blocker treatment through the method of clone-censor-weight. Covariates, 
      including patients' demographics, lifestyle, comorbidities, and recent 
      medications, were measured and controlled. Patients were followed up for 
      all-cause mortality or composite CVD outcomes (angina, myocardial infarction, 
      stroke/transient ischaemic attack, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation). We 
      estimated the five-year absolute risks, risk differences and risk ratio with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) with standardised, weighted pooled logistic 
      regression, which is a discrete-time hazard model for survival analysis. Several 
      sensitivity analyses were performed, including multiple imputation addressing the 
      missing data. FINDINGS: The median follow-up time was 4.1 (interquartile range, 
      1.9-7.8) years. The five-year absolute risk of all-cause mortality and CVD 
      outcomes were 4.9% (95% CI, 3.8-6.0) and 13.0% (95% CI, 11.4-15.0) among 
      beta-blocker users, and 4.0% (95% CI, 3.8-4.2) and 9.4% (95% CI, 9.1-9.7) among 
      non-beta-blocker users, respectively. The five-year absolute risk difference and 
      risk ratio between the two groups for all-cause mortality and CVD outcomes were 
      0.9% (95% CI, -0.2 to 2.1) and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.96-1.54), and 3.5% (95% CI, 
      2.1-5.5) and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.22-1.62), respectively. Findings were consistent 
      across the sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Beta-blocker treatment was 
      associated with an increased risk of CVD and a trend for an increased risk of 
      mortality among patients with OSA. Further studies are needed to confirm our 
      findings. FUNDING: Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong Special 
      Administration Region Government.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Communication and adoption of modern study design and analytical 
      techniques is of high importance for the improvement of clinical research from 
      observational data. OBJECTIVE: To compare a modern method for statistical 
      inference, including a target trial emulation framework and doubly robust 
      estimation, with approaches common in the clinical literature, such as Cox 
      proportional hazards models. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      retrospective cohort study used longitudinal electronic health record data for 
      outcomes at 28-days from time of hospitalization within a multicenter New York, 
      New York, hospital system. Participants included adult patients hospitalized 
      between March 1 and May 15, 2020, with COVID-19 and not receiving corticosteroids 
      for chronic use. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to March 2022. EXPOSURES: 
      Corticosteroid exposure was defined as more than 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone 
      equivalent in a 24-hour period. For target trial emulation, exposures were 
      corticosteroids for 6 days if and when a patient met criteria for severe hypoxia 
      vs no corticosteroids. For approaches common in clinical literature, treatment 
      definitions used for variables in Cox regression models varied by study design 
      (no time frame, 1 day, and 5 days from time of severe hypoxia). MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The main outcome was 28-day mortality from time of hospitalization. The 
      association of corticosteroids with mortality for patients with moderate to 
      severe COVID-19 was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      meta-analysis of corticosteroid randomized clinical trials as a benchmark. 
      RESULTS: A total of 3298 patients (median [IQR] age, 65 [53-77] years; 1970 [60%] 
      men) were assessed, including 423 patients who received corticosteroids at any 
      point during hospitalization and 699 patients who died within 28 days of 
      hospitalization. Target trial emulation analysis found corticosteroids were 
      associated with a reduced 28-day mortality rate, from 32.2%; (95% CI, 
      30.9%-33.5%) to 25.7% (95% CI, 24.5%-26.9%). This estimate is qualitatively 
      identical to the WHO meta-analysis odds ratio of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53-0.82). Hazard 
      ratios using methods comparable with current corticosteroid research range in 
      size and direction, from 0.50 (95% CI, 0.41-0.62) to 1.08 (95% CI, 0.80-1.47). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that clinical research based on 
      observational data can be used to estimate findings similar to those from 
      randomized clinical trials; however, the correctness of these estimates requires 
      designing the study and analyzing the data based on principles that are different 
      from the current standard in clinical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Drawing causal conclusions from real-world data (RWD) 
      poses methodological challenges and risk of bias. We aimed to systematically 
      assess the type and impact of potential biases that may occur when analyzing RWD 
      using the case of progressive ovarian cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively 
      compared overall survival with and without second-line chemotherapy (LOT2) using 
      electronic medical records. Potential biases were determined using directed 
      acyclic graphs. We followed a stepwise analytic approach ranging from crude 
      analysis and multivariable-adjusted Cox model up to a full causal analysis using 
      a marginal structural Cox model with replicates emulating a reference randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT). To assess biases, we compared effect estimates (hazard 
      ratios [HRs]) of each approach to the HR of the reference trial. RESULTS: The 
      reference trial showed an HR for second line vs. delayed therapy of 1.01 (95% 
      confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.82-1.25). The corresponding HRs from the RWD 
      analysis ranged from 0.51 for simple baseline adjustments to 1.41 (95% CI: 
      1.22-1.64) accounting for immortal time bias with time-varying covariates. Causal 
      trial emulation yielded an HR of 1.12 (95% CI: 0.96-1.28). CONCLUSION: Our study, 
      using ovarian cancer as an example, shows the importance of a thorough causal 
      design and analysis if one is expecting RWD to emulate clinical trial results.

TI  - Comparative cardiovascular safety of LABA/LAMA FDC versus LABA/ICS FDC in 
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a population-based cohort 
      study with a target trial emulation framework.
PG  - 239

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of combinations of long-acting β(2) agonists/long-acting 
      muscarinic antagonists (LABA/LAMA) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD) is increasing. Nevertheless, existing evidence on cardiovascular 
      risk associated with LABA/LAMA versus another dual combination, LABA/inhaled 
      corticosteroids (ICS), was limited and discrepant. AIM: The present cohort study 
      aimed to examine comparative cardiovascular safety of LABA/LAMA and LABA/ICS with 
      a target trial emulation framework, focusing on dual fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
      therapies. METHODS: We identified patients with COPD who initiated LABA/LAMA FDC 
      or LABA/ICS FDC from a nationwide Taiwanese database during 2017-2020. The 
      outcome of interest was a hospitalized composite cardiovascular events of acute 
      myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, and 
      ischemic stroke. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) 
      and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for composite and individual cardiovascular 
      events after matching up to five LABA/LAMA FDC initiators to one LABA/ICS FDC 
      initiator using propensity scores (PS). RESULTS: Among 75,926 PS-matched 
      patients, use of LABA/LAMA FDC did not show a higher cardiovascular risk compared 
      to use of LABA/ICS FDC, with a HR of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78-1.01) for the composite 
      events, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.61-1.05) for acute myocardial infarction, 1.48 (95% CI, 
      0.68-3.25) for unstable angina, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.80-1.24) for congestive heart 
      failure, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.37-1.05) for cardiac dysrhythmia, and 0.82 (95% CI, 
      0.66-1.02) for ischemic stroke. The results did not vary substantially in several 
      pre-specified sensitivity and subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide 
      important reassurance about comparative cardiovascular safety of LABA/LAMA FDC 
      treatment among patients with COPD.

TI  - Statin Use and Risk of Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Chinese Population: A Target 
      Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - e213489
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000213489 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Statins have been shown to prevent major vascular 
      events in a wide range of individuals. However, their potential mechanisms-such 
      as impairing fibrinogen cleavage and reducing thrombin generation-raise concerns 
      on increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Given the inconsistent 
      findings of previous trials and observational studies, this study aims to assess 
      the effect of statins on ICH risk in Chinese population. METHODS: Within the 
      framework of target trial emulation, we used data from the Yinzhou Regional 
      Health Care Database covering the years 2011-2020. The study included patients 
      aged 50 years or older with no history of ICH and statin use. After applying 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients were categorized as statin initiators 
      or noninitiators based on their initial treatment regimen during the 1-month 
      enrollment period. Using the sequential trial approach, 60 target trials were 
      emulated each month from 2011 to 2015. Propensity score (PS) matching was applied 
      to balance characteristics between statin initiators and noninitiators within 
      each emulated trial, and these trials were then stacked together into a single 
      data set. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of 
      statin on ICH risk, ICH-related mortality, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A 
      total of 53,413 statin initiators and 35,033,455 noninitiators from 60 emulated 
      trials were included in the analysis. Statin initiators were generally older 
      (mean age 65 vs 63 years), less likely to be male (45.5% vs 50.5%), and more 
      likely to have a history of hypertension (69.0% vs 14.1%). After PS matching, all 
      characteristics between the 2 groups were well balanced. With a median follow-up 
      of 6.7 (interquartile range 5.6-8.1) years, the hazard ratio (HR) of ICH for 
      statin initiators compared with noninitiators was 1.18 (95% CI 1.03-1.35). The 
      HRs of ICH-related mortality and all-cause mortality were 1.16 (95% CI 0.91-1.46) 
      and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.97), respectively. Results remained consistent across 
      various subgroup and sensitivity analyses. DISCUSSION: Statin use may increase 
      the risk of ICH in Chinese patients without history of ICH. However, the findings 
      of this study may be limited by residual confounding, particularly the lack of 
      cholesterol-related measurements. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides 
      Class III evidence that in Chinese populations, initiation of statins may 
      increase the risk of ICH.

TI  - Effect of Early Versus Delayed Tracheostomy Strategy on Functional Outcome of 
      Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - e1145
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000001145 [doi]
LID - e1145
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Optimal timing of tracheostomy in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
      is unknown due to lack of clinical trials. We emulated a target trial to estimate 
      the effect of early vs. delayed tracheostomy strategy on functional outcome of 
      patients with severe TBI. DESIGN: Target trial emulation using 1:1 balanced 
      risk-set matching. SETTING: North American hospitals participating in the TBI 
      Hypertonic Saline randomized controlled trial of the Resuscitation Outcomes 
      Consortium. PATIENTS: The prematching population consisted of patients with TBI 
      and admission Glasgow Coma Scale less than or equal to 8, who were alive and on 
      mechanical ventilation on the fourth day following trial enrollment, and stayed 
      in the ICU for at least 5 days. Patients with absolute indication for 
      tracheostomy and patients who died during the first 28 days with a decision to 
      withdraw care were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: We matched patients who received 
      tracheostomy at a certain timepoint (early group) with patients who had not 
      received tracheostomy at the same timepoint but were at-risk of tracheostomy in 
      the future (delayed group). The primary outcome was a poor 6-month functional 
      outcome, defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended less than or equal to 4. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Out of 1282 patients available for analysis, 275 
      comprised the prematching population, with 75 pairs being created postmatching. 
      Median time of tracheostomy differed significantly in the early vs. the delayed 
      group (7.0 d [6.0-10.0 d] vs. 12.0 d [9.8-18.3 d]; p < 0.001). Only 40% of 
      patients in the delayed group received tracheostomy. There was no statistically 
      significant difference between groups regarding poor 6-month functional outcome 
      (early: 68.0% vs. delayed: 72.0%; p = 0.593). CONCLUSIONS: In a target trial 
      emulation, early as opposed to delayed tracheostomy strategy was not associated 
      with differences in 6-month functional outcome following severe TBI. Considering 
      the limitations of target trial emulations, delaying tracheostomy through a 
      "watchful waiting" approach may be appropriate.

AB  - Trial emulation, also known as target trial emulation, has significantly advanced 
      epidemiology and causal inference by providing a robust framework for deriving 
      causal relationships from observational data. This approach aims to reduce biases 
      and confounding factors inherent in observational studies, thereby improving the 
      validity of causal inferences. By designing observational studies to mimic 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as closely as possible, researchers can 
      better control for confounding and bias. Key components of trial emulation 
      include defining a clear time-zero, simulating random assignment using techniques 
      like propensity score matching and inverse probability treatment weighting, 
      assessing group comparability by standardized mean differences and establishing a 
      clear comparison strategy. The increasing availability of large-scale real-world 
      databases, such as research cohorts, patient registries, and hospital records, 
      has driven the popularity of target trial emulation. These data sources offer 
      information on patient outcomes, treatment patterns, and disease progression in 
      real-world settings. By applying the principles of target trial emulation to 
      these rich data sources, researchers can design studies that provide robust 
      causal inferences about the effects of interventions, informing clinical 
      guidelines and regulatory decisions. Despite its advantages, trial emulation 
      faces challenges like data quality, unmeasured confounding, and implementation 
      complexity. Future directions include integrating trial emulation with machine 
      learning techniques and developing methods to address unmeasured confounding. 
      Overall, trial emulation represents a significant advancement in epidemiology, 
      offering a valuable tool for deriving accurate and reliable causal inferences 
      from observational data, ultimately improving public health outcomes.

AB  - Limited studies compared the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 
      molnupiravir against a control group on post-COVID-19 conditions. Our study 
      examined the association of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir with 
      post-acute mortality and hospitalizations among outpatients using real-world 
      outpatient records of COVID-19 designated clinics in Hong Kong. This is an 
      observational study using a target trial emulation framework, involving 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no antiviral treatment (Trial 1) and molnupiravir 
      versus no antiviral treatment (Trial 2). Outcomes included post-acute mortality, 
      all-cause hospitalization, and hospitalization due to 13 selected sequelae. 
      Relative effectiveness was assessed by comparing the cumulative incidence between 
      two groups, reported as relative risk (RR), along with risk differences (RD) 
      during day 0-30, 31-180, and 181-360. After screening, 140,477 and 96,030 
      patients were included in Trial 1 and 2, respectively. Compared with no 
      treatment, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated patients exhibited a significantly 
      lower risk of post-acute mortality (31-180 days: RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.96; RD, 
      0.20%; 181-360 days: RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.82; RD, 0.32%) and all-cause 
      hospitalization (31-180 days: RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88; RD, 1.11%; 181-360 
      days: RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.89; RD, 1.18%). Patients receiving molnupiravir 
      had a lower risk of 30-day mortality, but no significant beneficial effect was 
      observed for the post-acute outcomes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the 
      effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in reducing post-COVID-19 outcomes among 
      outpatients. While we observed the short-term effectiveness of molnupiravir in 
      reducing mortality, no protective effect on long-term post-COVID-19 outcomes was 
      observed.

AB  - To examine the effectiveness of azvudine and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in treating 
      hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. We emulated a target 
      trial with a multicenter retrospective cohort of hospitalized adults with 
      moderate-to-severe COVID-19 without contraindications for azvudine or 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir between December 01, 2022 and January 19, 2023 (during the 
      Omicron BA.5.2 variant wave). Exposures included treatment with azvudine or 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for 5 days versus no antiviral treatment during 
      hospitalization. Primary composite outcome (all-cause death and initiation of 
      invasive mechanical ventilation), and their separate events were evaluated. Of 
      the 1154 patients, 27.2% were severe cases. In the intent-to-treat analyses, 
      azvudine reduced all-cause death (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.12-0.78), 
      and its composite with invasive mechanical ventilation (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 
      0.24-0.92). Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced invasive mechanical ventilation (HR: 
      0.42; 95% CI: 0.17-1.05), and its composite with all-cause death (HR: 0.38; 95% 
      CI: 0.18-0.81). The study did not identify credible subgroup effects. The 
      per-protocol analyses and all sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of 
      the findings. Both azvudine and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir improved the prognosis of 
      hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

AB  - Health Technology Assessment (HTA) for reimbursement of all new cancer drugs in 
      the European Union (EU) will be evaluated for all member states by a central 
      European HTA starting in 2025. EU HTA guidelines for applicants under these new 
      regulations put the focus on meta-analysis of aggregated randomized trial data 
      and are in contrast with the growing number of cancer drug approvals by drug 
      regulators that are based on single arm studies and the needs in the rapidly 
      evolving field of oncological drug development. We advocate to broaden the 
      methodological approaches for HTA by including observational data based causal 
      inference methodology and target trial emulation into the assessments of 
      comparative effectiveness. Causal inference estimates causal estimands, effect 
      measures that reflect a population level effect in terms of contrasts of 
      counterfactual outcomes in the same patients and are directly measured in the 
      target population by modeling of hypothetical intervention. Target trial 
      emulation allows with the use of causal inference to estimate causal effects by 
      mimicking pragmatic trials that evolve apart from randomization like a trial. We 
      illustrate the potential of causal inference for HTA and provide an introduction 
      into causal inference methodology for health scientists involved in HTA.

TI  - Stopping Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors in Patients with Advanced CKD and 
      Risk of Adverse Outcomes: A Nationwide Study.
PG  - 424-435
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2020050682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether stopping renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 
      inhibitor therapy in patients with advanced CKD affects outcomes. METHODS: We 
      studied patients referred to nephrologist care, listed on the Swedish Renal 
      Registry during 2007-2017, who developed advanced CKD (eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 
      m(2)) while on RAS inhibitor therapy. Using target trial emulation techniques on 
      the basis of cloning, censoring, and weighting, we compared the risks of stopping 
      within 6 months and remaining off treatment versus continuing RAS inhibitor 
      therapy. These included risks of subsequent 5-year all-cause mortality, major 
      adverse cardiovascular events, and initiation of kidney replacement therapy 
      (KRT). RESULTS: Of 10,254 prevalent RAS inhibitor users (median age 72 years, 36% 
      female) with new-onset eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), 1553 (15%) stopped RAS 
      inhibitor therapy within 6 months. Median eGFR was 23 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). 
      Compared with continuing RAS inhibition, stopping this therapy was associated 
      with a higher absolute 5-year risk of death (40.9% versus 54.5%) and major 
      adverse cardiovascular events (47.6% versus 59.5%), but with a lower risk of KRT 
      (36.1% versus 27.9%); these corresponded to absolute risk differences of 13.6 
      events per 100 patients, 11.9 events per 100 patients, and -8.3 events per 100 
      patients, respectively. Results were consistent whether patients stopped RAS 
      inhibition at higher or lower eGFR, across prespecified subgroups, after 
      adjustment and stratification for albuminuria and potassium, and when modeling 
      RAS inhibition as a time-dependent exposure using a marginal structural model. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide observational study of people with advanced CKD, 
      stopping RAS inhibition was associated with higher absolute risks of mortality 
      and major adverse cardiovascular events, but also with a lower absolute risk of 
      initiating KRT.

TI  - Effectiveness of COVID-19 Treatment With Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir or Molnupiravir 
      Among U.S. Veterans: Target Trial Emulation Studies With One-Month and Six-Month 
      Outcomes.
PG  - 807-816

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information about the effectiveness of oral antivirals in preventing 
      short- and long-term COVID-19-related outcomes in the setting of Omicron variant 
      transmission and COVID-19 vaccination is limited. OBJECTIVE: To measure the 
      effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir for outpatient treatment 
      of COVID-19. DESIGN: Three retrospective target trial emulation studies comparing 
      matched cohorts of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no treatment, molnupiravir 
      versus no treatment, and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus molnupiravir. SETTING: 
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA). PARTICIPANTS: Nonhospitalized veterans in 
      VHA care who were at risk for severe COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 
      during January through July 2022. INTERVENTION: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or 
      molnupiravir pharmacotherapy. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of any hospitalization or 
      all-cause mortality at 30 days and from 31 to 180 days. RESULTS: Eighty-seven 
      percent of participants were male; the median age was 66 years, and 18% were 
      unvaccinated. Compared with matched untreated control participants, those treated 
      with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 9607) had lower 30-day risk for hospitalization 
      (22.07 vs. 30.32 per 1000 participants; risk difference [RD], -8.25 [95% CI, 
      -12.27 to -4.23] per 1000 participants) and death (1.25 vs. 5.47 per 1000 
      participants; RD, -4.22 [CI, -5.45 to -3.00] per 1000 participants). Among 
      persons alive at day 31, reductions were seen in 31- to 180-day incidence of 
      death (hazard ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.49 to 0.89]) but not hospitalization (subhazard 
      ratio, 0.90 [CI, 0.79 to 1.02]). Molnupiravir-treated participants (n = 3504) had 
      lower 30-day and 31- to 180-day risks for death (3.14 vs. 13.56 per 1000 
      participants at 30 days; RD, -10.42 [CI, -13.49 to -7.35] per 1000 participants; 
      hazard ratio at 31 to 180 days, 0.67 [CI, 0.48 to 0.95]) but not hospitalization. 
      A difference in 30-day or 31- to 180-day risk for hospitalization or death was 
      not observed between matched nirmatrelvir- or molnupiravir-treated participants. 
      LIMITATION: The date of COVID-19 symptom onset for most veterans was unknown. 
      CONCLUSION: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was effective in reducing 30-day 
      hospitalization and death. Molnupiravir was associated with a benefit for 30-day 
      mortality but not hospitalization. Further reductions in mortality from 31 to 180 
      days were observed with both antivirals. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: U.S. Department

      Emulation Study.
PG  - 1025-1037

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and subsequent severe 
      or fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet they have suboptimal responses 
      to mRNA and inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. The efficacy of tixagevimab-cilgavimab 
      in reducing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated in phase III 
      clinical trials. Nevertheless, real-world data on the effectiveness and safety of 
      tixagevimab-cilgavimab remain limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the 
      effectiveness and safety of tixagevimab-cilgavimab among immunocompromised 
      individuals. METHODS: Adults who were immunocompromised or receiving 
      immunosuppressive therapies were included in this target trial emulation using 
      territory-wide electronic health records in Hong Kong. A sequential trial 
      emulation approach was adopted to compare effectiveness and safety outcomes 
      between individuals who received tixagevimab-cilgavimab and individuals who did 
      not. RESULTS: A total of 746 tixagevimab-cilgavimab recipients and 2980 controls 
      were included from 1 May 2022 to 30 November 2022. Tixagevimab-cilgavimab 
      significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection (hazard ratio [HR] 0.708, 
      95% confidence interval [CI] 0.527-0.951) during a median follow-up of 60 days. 
      No significant difference was observed in the risk of COVID-19-related 
      hospitalisation. Zero versus eight COVID-19 mortality cases and zero versus two 
      severe COVID-19 cases were observed in tixagevimab-cilgavimab recipients and 
      controls, respectively. Notably, significant risk reduction in COVID-19 infection 
      was also observed among immunocompromised individuals who had been previously 
      vaccinated with three or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine, or had no prior COVID-19 
      infection history. CONCLUSIONS: Tixagevimab-cilgavimab was effective in reducing 
      COVID-19 infection among immunocompromised patients during the Omicron wave. 
      Findings were consistent among individuals who previously received three or more 
      doses of COVID-19 vaccine, or had no previous history of COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Target trial emulation of cardiovascular outcome trials of medications used to 
      treat type 2 diabetes using real-world data: a systematic review of observational 
      studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular outcome trials are mandated by the US 
      Food and Drug Administration to assess the cardiovascular safety of new 
      antidiabetic medications before entering the market. However, these trials often 
      involve highly selective populations and results may not generalize to routine 
      practice. METHODS: Our study aimed to synthesize observational studies to assess 
      the generalizability of cardiovascular outcome trials to routine practice. We 
      systematically reviewed observational studies that were target trial emulations 
      of previous cardiovascular outcome trials for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 
      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and sodium glucose 
      cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes. We 
      searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for observational studies 
      that focused on trial emulation or cross-sectional studies that reported the 
      proportion of real-world patients eligible for completed trials. RESULTS: 
      Nineteen studies were included in our systematic review, including four cohort 
      studies that were target trial emulations of previous randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) and 15 cross-sectional studies that evaluated trial eligibility. 
      Results between RCTs and real-world data (RWD) were concordant for all drug 
      classes in finding noninferiority. The median eligibility percentage ranged from 
      13% to 31% for SGLT-2 inhibitor trials and 12% to 43% for GLP-1 receptor agonist 
      trials. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, while RCTs and RWD are concordant 
      in their estimates, the trials lack representativeness. More research is needed 
      on the emulation of cardiovascular outcome trials using RWD to understand how 
      different emulation methods may impact findings.

TI  - Early Switch From Intravenous to Oral Antibiotics for Patients With Uncomplicated 
      Gram-Negative Bacteremia.
PG  - e2352314
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.52314 [doi]
LID - e2352314
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Gram-negative bacteremia is a global health concern, and optimizing 
      the transition from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics is a critical step in 
      improving patient treatment and resource utilization. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      association of switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood 
      culture with 90-day all-cause mortality compared with prolonged IV antibiotic 
      treatment for patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study conducted using the target trial 
      emulation framework included observational data from adults with uncomplicated 
      gram-negative bacteremia in 4 hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark, from January 1, 
      2018, through December 31, 2021. The duration of follow-up was 90 days. 
      Eligibility criteria included a blood culture positive for growth of 
      gram-negative bacteria, clinical stability within 4 days of initial blood 
      culture, an available susceptibility report on day 4, and initiation of 
      appropriate empirical IV antibiotic treatment within 24 hours of blood culture. 
      EXPOSURE: Switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture 
      compared with continuing IV antibiotic treatment for at least 5 days after 
      initial blood culture. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was 90-day 
      all-cause mortality. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to 
      adjust for confounding. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 
      performed using pooled logistic regression to estimate absolute risk, risk 
      difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR); 95% CIs were computed using bootstrapping. 
      RESULTS: A total of 914 individuals were included in the target trial emulation 
      analysis (512 [56.0%] male; median age, 74.5 years [IQR, 63.3-83.2 years]); 433 
      (47.4%) transitioned early to oral antibiotic treatment, and 481 (52.6%) received 
      prolonged IV treatment. Ninety-nine individuals (10.8%) died during follow-up. 
      The proportion of individuals who died was higher in the group receiving 
      prolonged IV treatment (69 [14.3%] vs 30 [6.9%]). In the intention-to-treat 
      analysis, 90-day all-cause mortality risk was 9.1% (95% CI, 6.7%-11.6%) for the 
      early-switch group and 11.7% (95% CI, 9.6%-13.8%) for the group receiving 
      prolonged IV treatment; the RD was -2.5% (95% CI, -5.7% to 0.7%) and RR was 0.78 
      (95% CI, 0.60-1.10). In the per-protocol analysis, the RD was -0.1% (95% CI, 
      -3.4% to 3.1%) and RR was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.70-1.40). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 
      this cohort study of uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia, early transition to 
      oral antibiotics within 4 days of initial blood culture was associated with 
      90-day all-cause mortality risk comparable to that of continuing IV antibiotic 
      treatment and may be an effective alternative to prolonged IV treatment.

TI  - Efficacy of COVID-19 Oral antivirals in hospitalised oldest-old with high 
      morbidity burden: a target trial emulation study.
LID - afae180 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afae180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are orally administered 
      pharmacotherapies for mild to moderate COVID-19. However, the effectiveness of 
      these drugs among very old (≥80 years), hospitalised patients remains unclear, 
      limiting the risk-benefit assessment of these antivirals in this specific group. 
      This study investigates the effectiveness of these antivirals in reducing 
      mortality among this group of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Using 
      a territory-wide public healthcare database in Hong Kong, a target trial 
      emulation study was conducted with data from 13 642 eligible participants for the 
      molnupiravir trial and 9553 for the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir trial. The primary 
      outcome was all-cause mortality. Immortal time and confounding bias was minimised 
      using cloning-censoring-weighting approach. Mortality odds ratios were estimated 
      by pooled logistic regression after adjusting confounding biases by stabilised 
      inverse probability weights. RESULTS: Both molnupiravir (HR: 0.895, 95% CI: 
      0.826-0.970) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (HR: 0.804, 95% CI: 0.678-0.955) 
      demonstrated moderate mortality risk reduction among oldest-old hospitalised 
      patients. No significant interaction was observed between oral antiviral 
      treatment and vaccination status. The 28-day risk of mortality was lower in 
      initiators than non-initiators for both molnupiravir (risk difference: -1.09%, 
      95% CI: -2.29, 0.11) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (risk difference: -1.71%, 95% CI: 
      -3.30, -0.16) trials. The effectiveness of these medications was observed 
      regardless of the patients' prior vaccination status. CONCLUSIONS: Molnupiravir 
      and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are moderately effective in reducing mortality risk 
      among hospitalised oldest-old patients with COVID-19, regardless of their 
      vaccination status.

TI  - Safety of Triptans in Patients Who Have or Are at High Risk for Cardiovascular 
      Disease: A Target Trial Emulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of triptans in migraine patients with 
      cardiovascular disease or elevated cardiovascular risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We 
      retrieved data from a multistate US-based health system (January 2000 to August 
      2022) on adults with migraine and confirmed cardiovascular/cerebrovascular 
      disease, or at least two cardiovascular risk factors. We compared the effect of 
      triptans to nontriptan treatments on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
      and its components at 60 days of starting treatments. We emulated a target trial 
      and used propensity score matching for analysis. RESULTS: The 3518 patients in 
      the triptan group were matched to the 3518 patients in the nontriptan group 
      (median age, 55 years; 80.60% female). At 60 days, 52 patients (1.48%) in the 
      triptan group had MACE, compared with 13 patients (0.37%) in the nontriptan group 
      (relative risk [RR], 4.00; 95% CI, 2.24 to 7.14). Patients treated with triptans 
      also had significantly higher risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (15 patients 
      (0.43%) vs 0 patients (0.00%)); heart failure (RR, 4.50; 95% CI, 1.91 to 10.61); 
      and nonfatal stroke (RR, 8.00; 95% CI, 1.00 to 63.96). Five patients (0.14%) in 
      each group died. The findings were consistent when analyses were restricted to 
      sumatriptan, oral administration of triptan, patients with chronic migraine, 
      history of cardiovascular disease, or history of cerebrovascular disease. 
      CONCLUSION: Triptans likely increase the risk of MACE; however, the incidence of 
      MACE remains low in migraine patients with cardiovascular disease or elevated 
      cardiovascular risk. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Treatments of Migraine With Triptans in 
      Individuals With Elevated Cardiovascular Risk and in Pregnant Women.

TI  - Effectiveness of tirzepatide in patients with HFpEF using a target trial 
      emulation retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 4471

AB  - Tirzepatide, a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) 
      and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, has shown promise in improving 
      metabolic and cardiovascular profiles in patients with obesity. However, its 
      potential benefits in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection 
      fraction (HFpEF) remain unclear. We conducted a real-world, retrospective cohort 
      study using the TriNetX global database. A total of 14,154 patients with HFpEF 
      were included after 1:1 propensity score matching. Tirzepatide use was associated 
      with significantly lower risks of the primary composite outcome of heart failure 
      exacerbation and all-cause mortality (HR 0.52), as well as reductions in major 
      adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.64) and major adverse kidney events (HR 
      0.44). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent benefits across different 
      strata. Sensitivity analyses using alternative exposure definitions confirmed the 
      robustness of the findings. These results support the potential clinical utility 
      of tirzepatide in HFpEF management and warrant further investigation in 
      randomized controlled trials.

      Convertase Subtilisin-Kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9-i) has emerged as a key 
      therapeutic target to lower LDL and were introduced for prevention of CV events. 
      Recently (June 2022) the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) modified the eligibility 
      criteria for the use of PCSK9-i. We designed an observational study to estimate 
      the prevalence of eligible subjects and evaluate the effectiveness of PCSK9-i 
      applying a Target Trial Emulation (TTE) approach based on Electronic Health 
      Records (EHR). Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria were identified from 
      July 2017 (when PCSK9-i became available) to December 2020. Outcomes were 
      all-cause death and the first hospitalization. Among eligible subjects, we 
      identified those treated at date of the first prescription. Inverse Probability 
      of Treatment Weights (IPTW) were estimated including demographic and clinical 
      covariates, history of treatment with statins and the month/year eligibility 
      date. Competing risk models on weighted cohorts were used to derive the Average 
      Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) in 
      subgroups of interest. Out of 1976 eligible subjects, 161 (8%) received treatment 
      with PCSK9-i. Treated individuals were slightly younger, predominantly male, had 
      more severe CV conditions, and were more often treated with statin compared to 
      the untreated subjects. The latter exhibited a higher prevalence of non-CV 
      comorbidities. A significant absolute and relative risk reduction of death and a 
      lower relative risk for the first hospitalization was observed. The risk 
      reduction for death was confirmed in CATE analysis. PCSk9-i were prescribed to a 
      minority of eligible subjects. Within the TTE framework, the analysis confirmed 
      the association between PCSK9-i and lower risk of events, aligning with findings 
      from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). In our study, PCSK9-i provided protection 
      specifically against all-cause death, expanding upon the evidence from RCTs that 
      had primarily focused on composite CV outcomes.

PG  - 453-461
LID - 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvad018 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To examine the dose dependency of diclofenac's cardiovascular risks. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish health registries and the target trial 
      emulation design, we conducted a series of 300 nationwide cohort studies during 
      1996-2020, each mimicking the strict design criteria of a clinical trial. Adults 
      eligible for inclusion had no recent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
      prescriptions, contraindications (gastrointestinal diseases, thrombocytopenia, or 
      heart failure), or conditions with low adherence (dementia or psychiatric 
      disease). Diclofenac initiators were compared to healthcare-seeking 
      non-initiators and head-to-head using an approximated high dose of ≥150 mg/day 
      vs. low dose of <150 mg/day. Cox regression was used to compute the incidence 
      rate ratio (IRR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 30 days 
      following initiation. We adjusted for age, sex, calendar period, comorbidity, 
      comedication, and socioeconomic position. Compared with non-initiators 
      (n = 3 789 617), diclofenac initiators (n = 1 894 834) had an approximately 50% 
      increased rate of MACE (IRR 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-1.63), 
      reflecting IRRs of 1.54 (95% CI: 1.40-1.69) for myocardial infarction, 1.29 
      (1.14-1.45) for ischaemic stroke, and 1.92 (1.71-2.16) for cardiac death. The 
      risk increase was observed for most conditions with chronic pain, in particular 
      headache (IRR 5.10, 95% CI: 1.46-17.85). The risk increase was similar for 
      initiators of high- (IRR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.40-1.71) and low-dose diclofenac (IRR 
      1.52, 1.41-1.63), which was confirmed in a head-to-head analysis (IRR 1.01, 95% 
      CI: 0.90-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Initiators of high- and low-dose diclofenac had 
      comparably increased cardiovascular risks. This finding provides evidence against 
      the assumption that low-dose diclofenac is risk-neutral.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of immunotherapy versus lenvatinib in advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: A real-world analysis using target trial emulation.
LID - 10.1097/HEP.0000000000001328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immunotherapy has emerged as an effective treatment for 
      advanced HCC. We aimed to investigate the real-world effectiveness of 
      immunotherapy compared to lenvatinib in HCC. APPROACH AND RESULTS: From the 
      TriNetX database, we used a target trial emulation framework and identified 
      patients with HCC who received first-line treatment with immunotherapy 
      (atezolizumab/bevacizumab or tremelimumab/durvalumab) or lenvatinib between or 
      between August 2018 and December 2023. OS was compared using Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression. After propensity score 
      matching, 1203 patients were included in each group. Immunotherapy was associated 
      with improved OS versus lenvatinib (median survival: 545 vs. 425 d; HR: 0.86, 95% 
      CI: 0.76-0.97). Regarding treatment type, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed 
      improved survival compared to lenvatinib (n=1070 in each group; HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 
      0.77-0.99), while the point estimate favored durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus 
      lenvatinib (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.59-1.12), though this difference was not 
      statistically significant, likely due to small sample size. Regarding etiology, 
      immunotherapy had improved OS compared to lenvatinib in viral hepatitis (n=510 in 
      each group; HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61-0.89) and alcohol-associated liver disease 
      (n=190 in each group; HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87), but not in metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases (n=156 in each group; HR: 0.96, 
      95% CI: 0.70-1.31). CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world analysis, immunotherapy was 
      associated with improved OS compared to lenvatinib in advanced HCC, with 
      consistent benefit across most subgroups. These findings support the use of 
      immunotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC.

AB  - The number of operations that surgeons have previously performed is associated 
      with their patients' outcomes. However, this association may not be causal, 
      because previous studies have often been cross-sectional and their analyses have 
      not considered time-varying confounding or positivity violations. In this paper, 
      using the example of surgeons who perform coronary artery bypass grafting, we 
      describe (hypothetical) target trials for estimation of the causal effect of the 
      surgeons' operative volumes on patient mortality. We then demonstrate how to 
      emulate these target trials using data from US Medicare claims and provide effect 
      estimates. Our target trial emulations suggest that interventions on physicians' 
      volume of coronary artery bypass grafting operations have little effect on 
      patient mortality. The target trial framework highlights key assumptions and 
      draws attention to areas of bias in previous observational analyses that deviated 
      from their implicit target trials. The principles of the presented methodology 
      may be adapted to other scenarios of substantive interest in health services 
      research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Demonstration of trial emulation ability to benchmark randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) from real-world data (RWD) is required to increase 
      confidence in the use of routinely collected data for decision making in 
      oncology. METHODS: To assess the frequency with which emulation findings align 
      with RCTs regarding effect size on overall survival (OS) in metastatic breast 
      cancer (MBC), 8 of 13 pre-selected pivotal RCTs in MBC were emulated using data 
      from 32,598 patients enrolled in the French ESME-MBC cohort between January 1, 
      2008 and December 31, 2021. Adjustment methods and confounders were selected a 
      priori for each emulation; stabilized weight was the reference method to mitigate 
      confounding. Concordance in OS hazard ratios with associated 95 % confidence 
      intervals between RCTs and emulations were assessed used predefined metrics based 
      on statistical significance, estimates, and standardized differences. RESULTS: 
      The effect sizes were consistent with RCT results in 7 out of the 8 emulations; 4 
      emulations achieved full statistical significance agreement; 5 emulations had a 
      point estimate included in the RCT CI (estimate agreement); 6 emulations reported 
      no significant differences between RCT and emulation (standardized difference 
      agreement). Discrepancies related to residual confounders and significant shifts 
      in prescription practices post-drug approval may arise in some cases. CONCLUSION: 
      Target trial emulation from RWD combined with appropriate adjustment can provide 
      conclusions similar to RCTs in MBC. In oncology, this methodology offers 
      opportunities for confirming the impact on long-term survival, for expanding 
      indications in patients excluded from RCTs and for comparative effectiveness in 
      single-arm trials using external control arms.

TI  - The risk associated with ultra-processed food intake on depressive symptoms and 
      mental health in older adults: a target trial emulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Longitudinal cohort studies across the lifespan suggest an 
      association between ultra-processed food (UPF) and depression. However, the 
      effect of UPF on depression and mental health in older adults has not been 
      determined. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of UPF on depressive 
      symptoms and mental health in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: A 
      pragmatic target trial was designed and emulated using the ASPirin in Reducing 
      Events in the Elderly longitudinal data. Participants were community-dwelling 
      older adults (≥ 70 years) in Australia. We specified and emulated the protocol of 
      a two-arm randomised pragmatic clinical trial using the level of UPF consumption 
      as the intervention. Greater than or equal to 4 servings of UPF per day was 
      considered the intervention, with less than 4 servings per day the control. 
      Dietary consumption was assessed using a mail-based diet screening questionnaire, 
      and the level of food processing was classified based on the NOVA classification. 
      The study outcomes were depressive symptoms, defined as a score of ≥ 8 on the 
      Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 10-item scale, and general mental 
      health, defined by the mental component summary score of the Short Form-12. We 
      applied inverse probability treatment weighting to balance confounders. Marginal 
      structural models were employed to estimate the population-level average effect 
      of intervention using generalised estimated equations. RESULTS: A total of 11,192 
      participants (3415 intervention and 7777 control) were eligible for the 
      emulation. High UPF consumption at time zero was associated with an increased 
      risk of depressive symptoms at follow-ups (RR: 1.10; CI: 1.04-1.18). The finding 
      was consistent with sensitivity analyses; after excluding participants on 
      antidepressants at time zero, the risk of depressive symptoms in the intervention 
      group was increased by 11% compared to the control (RR: 1.11; 95% CI: 
      (1.04-1.20)). Consumption of UPF adversely affected the mental component quality 
      of life (β: - 0.40; CI: - 0.65 to - 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: A higher level of UPF 
      consumption was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms and 
      adversely affected mental health among older adults.

TI  - Risks for Anaphylaxis With Intravenous Iron Formulations : A Retrospective Cohort 
      Study.
PG  - 656-664
LID - 10.7326/M21-4009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risks for anaphylaxis among intravenous (IV) iron products 
      currently in use have not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: To compare risks for 
      anaphylaxis among 5 IV iron products that are used frequently. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study using a target trial emulation framework. SETTING: 
      Medicare fee-for-service data with Part D coverage between July 2013 and December 
      2018. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults receiving their first administration of IV iron. 
      MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the occurrence of anaphylaxis within 1 day 
      of IV iron administration, ascertained using a validated case definition. 
      Analysis was adjusted for 40 baseline covariates using inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting. The adjusted incidence rates (IRs) for anaphylaxis per 
      10 000 first administrations and odds ratios (ORs) were computed. RESULTS: The 
      adjusted IRs for anaphylaxis per 10 000 first administrations were 9.8 cases (95% 
      CI, 6.2 to 15.3 cases) for iron dextran, 4.0 cases (CI, 2.5 to 6.6 cases) for 
      ferumoxytol, 1.5 cases (CI, 0.3 to 6.6 cases) for ferric gluconate, 1.2 cases 
      (CI, 0.6 to 2.5 cases) for iron sucrose, and 0.8 cases (CI, 0.3 to 2.6 cases) for 
      ferric carboxymaltose. Using iron sucrose as the referent category, the adjusted 
      ORs for anaphylaxis were 8.3 (CI, 3.5 to 19.8) for iron dextran and 3.4 (CI, 1.4 
      to 8.3) for ferumoxytol. When cohort entry was restricted to the period after 
      withdrawal of high-molecular-weight iron dextran from the U.S. market in 2014, 
      the risk for anaphylaxis associated with low-molecular-weight iron dextran (OR, 
      8.4 [CI, 2.8 to 24.7]) did not change appreciably. Anaphylactic reactions 
      requiring hospitalizations were observed only among patients using iron dextran 
      or ferumoxytol. LIMITATION: Generalizability to non-Medicare populations. 
      CONCLUSION: The rates of anaphylaxis were very low with all IV iron products but 
      were 3- to 8-fold greater for iron dextran and ferumoxytol than for iron sucrose.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation of the Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic Vaccine 
      for Pre-Exposure Mpox Prevention in At-Risk Populations.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060594 [doi]
LID - 594
AB  - Background: The MVA-BN vaccine is considered effective for preventing mpox in key 
      populations, based on observational studies, though no randomized trials have yet 
      confirmed its effectiveness. Observational studies published to date rely on 
      retrospective analyses of routine data, often missing information on relevant 
      risk factors for mpox. Methods: Multi-country target trial emulation study with 
      prospective data collection. Between 1 September 2022 and 15 June 2023, we 
      recruited individuals eligible for mpox vaccination based on clinical history and 
      exposure behaviors via healthcare centers and social venues in Spain, Peru, 
      Panama, and Chile. Vaccinated individuals were paired with unvaccinated 
      counterparts matched by mpox risk factors, country, recruitment date, and age. 
      Follow-up continued via periodic surveys until 31 March 2024. The primary 
      endpoint was symptomatic mpox occurrence ≥14 days post-vaccination. Results: The 
      primary analysis included 1028 individuals (514 vaccinated, 514 unvaccinated) 
      with a median follow-up time of 9.3 months (IQR 4.7-13.7). Mpox occurred in eight 
      participants (0.8%): three vaccinated and five unvaccinated (HR 0.6; 95% CI 
      0.21-1.70). Adverse reactions were reported by 731 (49.6%) participants, 
      predominantly skin reactions (703/1475; 47.7%), while systemic reactions occurred 
      in 107 (7.3%). Long-lasting erythema at the injection site was reported in 
      450/1058 (42.5%) participants, persisting >6 months in 107 of them (23.8%). 
      Conclusions: The low incidence of mpox during the study period resulted in a 
      limited number of endpoint events, precluding robust conclusions on the efficacy 
      of the MVA-BN vaccine as pre-exposure prevention for mpox. However, our analysis, 
      which accounted for key confounders such as exposure behaviors, yielded results 
      consistent with previous studies suggesting the effectiveness of the vaccine in 
      the mpox setting.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Agitation is a major problem in the intensive care unit. However, no 
      treatment has clearly emerged as effective and safe. Using target trial 
      emulation, we aimed to test the hypothesis that early intervention with 
      dexmedetomidine would accelerate agitation resolution. METHODS: We read clinical 
      notes in an electronic medical records system with natural language processing to 
      identify patients with agitation. We obtained their demographics, trajectories, 
      associations, and outcomes. We used g-formulas to study the possible effects of 
      dexmedetomidine on agitation resolution and key outcomes. RESULTS: We screened 
      7525 patients. Overall, 2242 patients (29.8%) developed within-intensive care 
      unit agitation, and 2052 (27.3%) were eligible for inclusion in the target trial 
      emulation, with 314 treated with dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine-treated 
      patients had more severe illness and were more likely to have unplanned emergency 
      admissions with medical diagnoses. However, they achieved higher rates of 
      resolution of within-intensive care unit agitation (94% versus 72%; p < 0.001) 
      and lower 30-day mortality (5% versus 9%; p = 0.033). Early initiation of 
      dexmedetomidine accelerated the resolution of agitation (risk ratio [RR] 1.13 
      [95%CI 1.03 - 1.21]; risk difference [RD] 9.8% [95%CI 2.6% - 15.4%]); extubation 
      by Day 30 (RR 1.03 [95%CI 1.02 - 1.04]; RD 3.1% [95%CI 2.2% - 4.2%]); and reduced 
      the chance of having a tracheostomy by Day 30 (RR 0.67 [95%CI 0.34 - 0.99]; RD 
      -3.5% [95%CI -7.0% - -0.0%]). CONCLUSION: Through target trial emulation 
      analysis, early dexmedetomidine was associated with an increased rate of 
      resolution of agitation and extubation and decreased tracheostomy risk.

TI  - Hormone therapy and venous thromboembolism risk in women of menopausal age: a 
      target trial emulation.
PG  - 1341-1351
LID - 10.1007/s10654-024-01181-x [doi]
AB  - Contemporary data from randomized clinical trials focusing on the effect of oral 
      hormone therapy (HT) on venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women aged 50-60 years 
      are scarce despite evolving HT regimens. Here, we evaluated the association 
      between HT and the risk of developing VTE using a target trial emulation among 
      women of menopausal age. This retrospective cohort study applied a target trial 
      emulation framework using claims data from a universal health insurance program 
      in Taiwan. We emulated a sequence of trials in which women aged 50-60 years with 
      no previous history of HT, hysterectomy, gynecologic disorders, or cardiovascular 
      events were enrolled. Eligibility and HT use were evaluated monthly from 2011 to 
      2019. Eligible women were classified as either HT initiators or non-initiators 
      for each consecutive month. Observational analogs of the intention-to-treat and 
      per-protocol effects were estimated using pooled logistic regression models. Of 
      the 150,686,148 eligible person-trials (3,001,112 women), 192,215 initiators and 
      768,860 propensity score-matched non-initiators were included in the analysis. 
      The average duration of the HT was 1.25 years. Over a median follow-up of 5.83 
      years, 3,334 women developed VTE. The estimated hazard ratio (95% confidence 
      interval) was 0.96 (0.88, 1.04) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.66 
      (0.41, 1.05) in per-protocol analysis. The estimated intention-to-treat and 
      per-protocol 5-year VTE-free survival differences (95% confidence interval) were 
      0.1‰ (- 0.3‰, 0.7‰) and 0.3‰ (- 2.8‰, 4.0‰), respectively. In the contemporary 
      clinical setting, we did not observe an increased VTE risk associated with HT in 
      women aged 50-60 years.

TI  - Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists and Risk for Depression in Older Adults 
      With Type 2 Diabetes : A Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 315-326
LID - 10.7326/ANNALS-24-01347 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have 
      shown potential antidepressant effects, population studies yield inconsistent 
      results. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk for depression in older adults with type 
      2 diabetes (T2D) initiating treatment with GLP-1RAs versus sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors 
      (DPP4is). DESIGN: Target trial emulation study. SETTING: U.S. National Medicare 
      administrative data from January 2014 to December 2020. PATIENTS: Adults aged 66 
      years or older with T2D initiating treatment with a GLP-1RA were matched 1:1 on 
      propensity score with those initiating treatment with either an SGLT2i or a 
      DPP4i. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was incident depression. Cox 
      proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio 
      (HR) with 95% CI within matched groups. RESULTS: A total of 14 665 matched pairs 
      of older adults were included in the cohort for GLP-1RAs versus SGLT2is; the rate 
      difference of depression between GLP-1RA users and SGLT2i users was 3.48 (95% CI, 
      -0.81 to 7.78) per 1000 person-years, with an HR of 1.07 (CI, 0.98 to 1.18). In 
      the cohort for GLP-1RAs versus DPP4is (13 711 matched pairs), the rate difference 
      was -5.78 (CI, -10.49 to -1.07) per 1000 person-years, with an HR of 0.90 (CI, 
      0.82 to 0.98). LIMITATION: Unmeasured confounders (such as hemoglobin A(1c) 
      levels and body mass index), outcome misclassification, and limited 
      generalizability to all GLP-1RA users (for example, younger populations or those 
      without T2D receiving the drug for obesity treatment). CONCLUSION: Among older 
      adults with T2D, the incidence of depression was relatively low. Use of GLP-1RAs 
      was associated with a modestly lower risk for depression compared with use of 
      DPP4is, but not SGLT2is. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institute of Diabetes

TI  - Evaluating recommendation-based dietary and physical activity strategies for 
      prostate cancer prevention: a target trial emulation in the Health Professionals 
      Follow-up Study.
PG  - 449-459

AB  - The 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research 
      recommends sustained strategies of physical activity and diet for cancer 
      prevention, but evidence for long-term prostate cancer risk is limited. Using 
      observational data from 27 859 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 
      we emulated a target trial of recommendation-based physical activity and dietary 
      strategies and 26-year risks of prostate cancer, adjusting for risk factors via 
      the parametric g-formula. Compared with no intervention, limiting sugar-sweetened 
      beverages showed a 0.4% (0.0%-0.9%) lower risk of lethal (metastatic or fatal) 
      disease and 0.5% (0.1%-0.9%) lower risk of fatal disease. Restricting consumption 
      of processed foods showed a 0.4% to 0.9% higher risk of all prostate cancer 
      outcomes. Estimated risk differences for clinically significant disease were 
      close to null for strategies involving fruits and nonstarchy vegetables, whole 
      grains and legumes, red meat, and processed meat, as well as under a joint 
      strategy of physical activity and diet. Compared with a "low-adherence" strategy, 
      maintaining recommended physical activity levels showed a 0.4% (0.1%-0.8%) lower 
      risk of lethal and 0.5% (0.2%-0.8%) lower risk of fatal disease. Adhering to 
      specific components of current physical activity and dietary recommendations may 
      help to prevent lethal and fatal prostate cancer over 26 years.

LID - e070963
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Observational studies represent an alternative to estimate 
      real-world causal effects in the absence of available randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs). Target trial emulation is a framework for the application of RCT 
      design principles to emulate a hypothetical open-label RCT (the hypothetical 
      target trial) using existing observational data as the primary data source as 
      opposed to the prospective recruitment and measurement of randomised units. The 
      aim of this systematic review is to investigate the practices of studies applying 
      the target trial emulation framework to evaluate the effectiveness of 
      interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will systematically search in Medline 
      (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid, entries from medRxiv are included), PsycINFO (via 
      Ovid), SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, the ISRCTN registry and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov for all study reports and protocols which used the trial 
      emulation framework (without time restriction). We will extract information 
      concerning study design, data source, analysis, results, interpretation and 
      dissemination. Two reviewers will perform study selection, data extraction and 
      quality assessment. Disagreements between reviewers will be resolved by a third 
      reviewer. A narrative approach will be used to synthesise and report qualitative 
      and quantitative data. Reporting of the review will be informed by Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidance (PRISMA). ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as it is a protocol for a 
      systematic review. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed 
      publications and conference presentations.

TI  - Reduced risks of influenza-associated hospitalization and complications following 
      vaccination among over 2 million older individuals: a nationwide study using 
      target trial emulation framework.
PG  - 157
LID - 10.1186/s12916-025-03955-w [doi]
LID - 157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), which is 
      predominately derived from small high-risk older populations and focuses on 
      specific influenza-related complications, might not be generalizable to 
      real-world older populations with diverse characteristics in Taiwan. Therefore, 
      this observational study with a target trial emulation framework aimed to 
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of an influenza vaccine on influenza 
      infection, complications, and associated healthcare utilization and costs. 
      METHODS: 1,214,392 propensity-score-matched pairs of vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      older populations from the influenza season of 2018/2019 were identified from 
      Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. VE (estimated as 1 minus 
      hazard ratio [HR]*100%) and the HRs were used for influenza events and associated 
      complications, respectively. RESULTS: Primary analyses show 14% (10-18%) of VE 
      against influenza-associated hospitalization, irrespective of age, frailty 
      status, and underlying influenza risk. Notably, a decline in VE for 
      influenza-associated hospitalization was observed when the observational period 
      following vaccination was extended (25% [19-30%], 23% [18-28%], and 14% [10-18%] 
      for the intervals October 2018-March 2019, October 2018-May 2019, and October 
      2018-September 2019, respectively). Compared with non-vaccination, having an 
      influenza vaccination significantly reduced risks of influenza-associated death 
      by 30%, various respiratory by 12-26%, cardiovascular complications by 39-47%, 
      and acute kidney injury by 23%. Approximately savings of USD 3,000,000 in total 
      from averting influenza-associated hospitalization following vaccination were 
      found. The non-significant effects of the influenza vaccine on negative control 
      outcomes support the validity of the study procedures. CONCLUSIONS: VE for severe 
      influenza events (i.e., those requiring hospitalization) and related 
      complications among the real-world older population was corroborated. To avoid 
      severe influenza episodes and complications and minimize associated economic 
      consequences, continuous influenza vaccine uptake over different influenza 
      seasons is recommended for this population.

TI  - Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection: a 
      target trial emulation.
PG  - 112-116
LID - 10.1038/s41591-023-02674-0 [doi]
AB  - To date, there is a lack of randomized trial data examining the use of the 
      antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pregnant persons. This target trial emulation study aimed 
      to address this gap by evaluating the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in 
      nonhospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant 
      infection. Among patients diagnosed between 16 March 2022 and 5 February 2023, 
      exposure was defined as outpatient nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment within 5 days 
      of symptom onset or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. Primary 
      outcomes were maternal morbidity and mortality index (MMMI), all-cause maternal 
      death and COVID-19-related hospitalization, while secondary outcomes were 
      individual components of MMMI, preterm birth, stillbirth, neonatal death and 
      cesarean section. One-to-ten propensity-score matching was conducted between 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir users and nonusers, followed by cloning, censoring and 
      weighting. Overall, 211 pregnant women on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 1,998 
      nonusers were included. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was associated with 
      reduced 28-day MMMI risk (absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 1.47%, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) = 0.21-2.34%) but not 28-days COVID-19-related hospitalization 
      (ARR = -0.09%, 95% CI = -1.08% to 0.71%). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was 
      also associated with reduced risks of cesarean section (ARR = 1.58%, 95% 
      CI = 0.85-2.39%) and preterm birth (ARR = 2.70%, 95% CI = 0.98-5.31%). No events 
      of maternal or neonatal death or stillbirth were recorded. The findings suggest 
      that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is an effective treatment in symptomatic pregnant 
      women with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection.

TI  - Target Serum Urate Achievement and Chronic Kidney Disease Progression in Patients 
      With Gout and Kidney Disease.
PG  - 74-82
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.6212 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Clinicians often approach urate-lowering therapy (ULT) cautiously in 
      patients with gout and impaired kidney function because they are concerned about 
      the risk of progression to severe or end-stage kidney disease. However, evidence 
      from randomized clinical trials of this association remains inconclusive. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between achieving target serum urate level 
      with ULT and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to severe or end-stage 
      in patients with gout and impaired kidney function. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This was a cohort study using the target trial emulation approach 
      using data from a general practice database (IQVIA Medical Research Database) for 
      2000 to 2023. Eligible patients were 40 to 89 years old and had gout and CKD 
      stage 3. Data analyses were performed from November 2023 to September 2024. 
      EXPOSURES: Lowering serum urate level to target level (<6 mg/dL) using ULT. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Severe or end-stage kidney disease, determined by an 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 on at least 2 
      occasions more than 90 days apart within 1 year, or at least 1 Read code (per the 
      Refined Etiology, Anatomical Site, and Diagnosis classification) for CKD stages 4 
      or 5, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplant. The prespecified 
      noninferiority margin of the hazard ratio (HR) was set at 1.2, comparing those 
      who achieved the target serum urate level with those who did not. RESULTS: Among 
      the 14 792 participants (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [9.5] years; 9215 men [62.3%] and 
      5577 women [37.7%]) with gout and with CKD stage 3, the 5-year risk of severe or 
      end-stage kidney disease was 10.32% for those who achieved the target serum urate 
      level and 12.73% for those who did not. Compared with those not achieving the 
      target level, the adjusted 5-year risk difference and HR of severe or end-stage 
      kidney disease for patients achieving the target serum urate level was -2.41% 
      (95% CI, -4.61% to -0.21%) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study indicate that in 
      patients with gout and CKD stage 3, lowering serum urate level to less than 6 
      mg/dL vs 6 mg/dL or greater using ULT was not associated with an increased risk 
      of severe or end-stage kidney disease. These findings support optimizing ULT to 
      achieve target serum urate levels when treating patients with gout and impaired 
      kidney function.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation of Empiric Antibiotics on Clinical Outcomes in Moderately 
      Immunocompromised Patients Hospitalized with Pneumonia.
LID - ciaf344 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaf344 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients are often excluded from pneumonia trials, 
      guidelines, and stewardship interventions.The objective of this study was to 
      evaluate whether empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment impacts mortality 
      and other clinical outcomes in moderately immunocompromised patients without risk 
      factors for multidrug-resistant organisms hospitalized with community-acquired 
      pneumonia. METHODS: This was a target trial emulation including moderately 
      immunocompromised (asplenia, hematologic malignancies, solid organ malignancy 
      receiving chemotherapy, kidney transplant >1 year prior, congenital/acquired 
      immunodeficiency and receiving immunosuppressive medications) patients with 
      pneumonia without risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms at 69 hospitals 
      in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety ConsortiumThis study compared the 
      receipt of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics against antibiotics targeting 
      typical respiratory pathogens on hospital day 1 or 2.The primary outcome was 
      mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, transfer to the intensive 
      care unit and 30-day readmission, emergency department visit, Clostridioides 
      difficile infection and antibiotic-associated adverse events. RESULTS: Of 2706 
      moderately immunocompromised patients with pneumonia, 59% (N=1596) received 
      empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. MRSA and resistant gram-negative bacteria 
      were rare (94/2706, 3.5%). After adjustment, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic 
      treatment was not associated with mortality, but was associated with readmission 
      (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.32 [1.05-1.66]), transfer to ICU (aHR, 2.65 
      [1.32-5.30]) and longer hospitalization (adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 1.14 
      [1.10-1.19]). CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised patients hospitalized with pneumonia 
      often receive empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics despite low rates of 
      multidrug-resistant organisms. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use was not 
      associated with mortality, but was associated with harm, including 30-day 
      readmission, transfer to ICU and longer duration of hospitalization.

TI  - Improving Sarcoma Outcomes: Target Trial Emulation to Compare the Impact of 
      Unplanned and Planned Resections on the Outcome.
LID - 10.3390/cancers16132443 [doi]
LID - 2443
AB  - This study follows the Target Trial Emulation (TTE) framework to assess the 
      impact of unplanned resections (UEs) and planned resections (PEs) of sarcomas on 
      local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), 
      cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Sarcomas, malignant 
      tumors with mesenchymal differentiation, present a significant clinical challenge 
      due to their rarity, complexity, and the frequent occurrence of UEs, which 
      complicates effective management. Our analysis utilized real-world-time data from 
      the Swiss Sarcoma Network, encompassing 429 patients, to compare the impact of 
      UEs and PEs, adjusting for known prognostic factors through a multivariable Cox 
      regression model and propensity score weighting. Our findings reveal a 
      significantly higher risk of local recurrence for UEs and a short-term follow-up 
      period that showed no marked differences in MFS, CSS, and OS between the UE and 
      PE groups, underlining the importance of optimal initial surgical management. 
      Furthermore, tumor grade was validated as a critical prognostic factor, 
      influencing outcomes irrespective of surgical strategy. This study illuminates 
      the need for improved referral systems to specialized sarcoma networks to prevent 
      UEs and advocates for the integration of TTE in sarcoma research to enhance 
      clinical guidelines and decision-making in sarcoma care. Future research should 
      focus on the prospective validations of these findings and the exploration of 
      integrated care models to reduce the incidence of UEs and improve patient 
      outcomes.

      post-resuscitation epinephrine to norepinephrine.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Epinephrine and norepinephrine are the two most commonly used 
      prehospital vasopressors in the United States. Prior studies have suggested that 
      use of a post-ROSC epinephrine infusion may be associated with increased rearrest 
      and mortality in comparison to use of norepinephrine. We used target trial 
      emulation methodology to compare the rates of rearrest and mortality between the 
      groups of OHCA patients receiving these vasopressors in the prehospital setting. 
      METHODS: Adult (18-80 years of age) non-traumatic OHCA patients in the 2018-2022 
      ESO Data Collaborative datasets with a documented post-ROSC norepinephrine or 
      epinephrine infusion were included in this study. Logistic regression modeling 
      was used to evaluate the association between vasopressor agent and outcome using 
      two sets of covariables. The first set of covariables included standard Utstein 
      factors, the dispatch to ROSC interval, the ROSC to vasopressor interval, and the 
      follow-up interval. The second set added prehospital systolic blood pressure and 
      SpO(2) values. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis was also conducted and the 
      vasopressor groups were compared using a multivariable Cox regression model. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 1,893 patients treated by 309 EMS agencies were eligible for 
      analysis. 1,010 (53.4%) received an epinephrine infusion and 883 (46.7%) received 
      a norepinephrine infusion as their initial vasopressor. Adjusted analyses did not 
      discover an association between vasopressor agent and rearrest (aOR: 0.93 [0.72, 
      1.21]) or mortality (aOR: 1.00 [0.59, 1.69]). CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-agency 
      target trial emulation, the use of a post-resuscitation epinephrine infusion was 
      not associated with increased odds of rearrest in comparison to the use of a 
      norepinephrine infusion.

TI  - Effect of surgery versus chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer patients: a target 
      trial emulation.
PG  - 1072-1079
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djae024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To estimate the causal effect of surgery vs chemotherapy on survival 
      in patients with T1-3NxM0 pancreatic cancer in a rigorous framework addressing 
      selection bias and immortal time bias. METHODS: We used population-based Danish 
      health-care registries to conduct a cohort study emulating a hypothetical 
      randomized trial to estimate the absolute difference in survival, comparing 
      surgery with chemotherapy. We included pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed 
      during 2008-2021. Exposure was surgery or chemotherapy initiated within a 16-week 
      grace period after diagnosis. At the time of diagnosis, data of each patient were 
      duplicated; one copy was assigned to the surgery protocol, and one copy to the 
      chemotherapy protocol of the hypothetical trial. Copies were censored when the 
      assigned treatment deviated from the observed treatment. To account for 
      informative censoring, uncensored patients were weighted according to 
      confounders. For comparison, we also applied a more conventional analysis using 
      propensity score-based inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: We included 1744 
      patients with a median age of 68 years: 73.6% underwent surgery, and 18.6% had 
      chemotherapy without surgery; 7.8% received no treatment. The 3-year survival was 
      39.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 36.7% to 42.6%) after surgery and 22.7% 
      (95% CI = 17.7% to 28.4%) after chemotherapy, corresponding to an absolute 
      difference of 17.0% (95% CI = 10.8% to 23.1%). In the conventional survival 
      analysis, this difference was 23.0% (95% CI = 17.0% to 29.0%). CONCLUSION: 
      Surgery was superior to chemotherapy in achieving long-term survival for 
      pancreatic cancer. The difference comparing surgery and chemotherapy was 
      substantially smaller when using the clone-censor-weight approach than 
      conventional survival analysis.

TI  - Safety outcomes of tocilizumab and tofacitinib treatment for rheumatoid 
      arthritis: Target trial emulation.
PG  - e15406
LID - 10.1111/1756-185X.15406 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have been the 
      primary treatment option for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 
      Taiwan since 2010. Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, whereas 
      tofacitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor. The two medications were indicated to 
      treat RA by direct and indirect inhibition of interleukin-6 cytokine. We compared 
      the safety outcomes of tocilizumab and tofacitinib in patients with RA in 
      real-world clinical settings, following the 7 key components of target trial 
      emulation (TTE). METHODS: The data source was the Taiwan National Health 
      Insurance Research Database. Patients with RA between 2010 and 2018 were eligible 
      and assigned to either tocilizumab or tofacitinib based on their first 
      prescription of these two medications. The index date was set as the first 
      prescription date of either study medication. Propensity score stabilized 
      weighting (PSSW) was used to balance the characteristics between the two 
      medication groups. The incidences of safety outcomes were all-cause mortality, 
      cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thrombosis events, tuberculosis, 
      joint replacement events, and herpes zoster infection. The intention-to-treat 
      (ITT) effect was commenced from the index date until the study outcomes, 
      independently, 3 years, withdrawal, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred 
      first. For the per-protocol (PP) effect, patients were required to maintain the 
      same medical group during the entire follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 2125 
      patients with RA who were prescribed tocilizumab (n = 844) or tofacitinib 
      (n = 1281) were included in this study. The mean follow-up duration was 
      2.78 years in the tocilizumab group and 2.83 years in the tofacitinib group. For 
      ITT, the sample sizes were 721 and 1196 for the tocilizumab and tofacitinib, 
      respectively, after PSSW. A substantially lower incidence rate of herpes zoster 
      infection (per 100 patient-years) was observed in the tocilizumab group (3.67) 
      than in the tofacitinib group (7.61), with a hazard ratio of 0.48 (95%CI 
      =0.37-0.63; p < .0001). All-cause mortality, cancer, coronary heart disease, 
      stroke, total hip replacement, and tuberculosis were similar between the two 
      medication groups. For PP, the sample sizes were 619 and 1085 for the tocilizumab 
      and tofacitinib, respectively, after PSSW. The results of the PP analysis were 
      similar to those of the ITT analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab and tofacitinib 
      act along the same inflammatory pathway. A lower herpes zoster incident rate was 
      observed in the tocilizumab group than in the tofacitinib group. The incidence 
      rates of other safety concerns and mortality rates were comparable in both groups 
      of patients with RA treated in real-world settings.

AB  - Target trial emulation (TTE) aims to estimate treatment effects by simulating 
      randomized controlled trials using real-world observational data. Applying TTE 
      across distributed datasets shows great promise in improving generalizability and 
      power but is always infeasible due to privacy and data-sharing constraints. Here 
      we propose a Federated Learning-based TTE framework, FL-TTE, that enables TTE 
      across multiple sites without sharing patient-level data. FL-TTE incorporates 
      federated protocol design, federated inverse probability of treatment weighting, 
      and a federated Cox proportional hazards model to estimate time-to-event outcomes 
      across heterogeneous data. We validated FL-TTE by emulating Sepsis trials using 
      eICU and MIMIC-IV data from 192 hospitals, and Alzheimer's trials using INSIGHT 
      Network across five New York City health systems. FL-TTE produced less biased 
      estimates than traditional meta-analysis methods when compared to pooled results 
      and is theoretically supported. Our FL-TTE enables federated treatment effect 
      estimation across distributed and heterogeneous data in a privacy-preserved way.

TI  - Association Between Use of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors and 
      Epilepsy: A Population-Based Study Using Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 827-836
LID - 10.2337/dc24-2532 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preclinical studies in animals have suggested potential 
      neuroprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), 
      but no epidemiological study has investigated the potential effects of SGLT-2is 
      on epilepsy risk. We aimed to assess the association between use of SGLT-2is and 
      epilepsy incidence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We emulated a target trial 
      comparing SGLT-2is and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) based on the 
      Yinzhou Regional Health Care Database. Cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus who were new users of an SGLT-2i or a DPP-4i were assembled. Inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and Cox proportional hazards regression 
      modeling were applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of the 
      association between use of SGLT-2is and incidence of epilepsy. RESULTS: The final 
      cohort included 24,930 new users of SGLT-2is and 28,924 initiators of DPP-4is. A 
      total of 243 patients with incident epilepsy were found during a median follow-up 
      of 2.0 (interquartile range 0.8-3.3) years, with the incidence of epilepsy being 
      174.2 and 231.5 per 100,000 person-years in users of SGLT-2is and DPP-4is, 
      respectively. After controlling for potential confounding using IPTW, SGLT-2i use 
      was associated with a lower incidence of epilepsy, with an HR of 0.71 (95% CI 
      0.52-0.97). Various subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses supported the 
      results in primary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT-2is were associated with a reduced 
      incidence of epilepsy in the study population. More studies are needed to confirm 
      and replicate the study results.

TI  - Generating real-world evidence in early Alzheimer's disease: Considerations for 
      applying the target trial emulation framework to study the safety of anti-amyloid 
      therapies.
PG  - e70080
LID - 10.1002/trc2.70080 [doi]
LID - e70080
AB  - Anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies (anti-Aβ mAbs) have received approval 
      from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with mild 
      cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (collectively 
      known as early AD) based on evidence from clinical trials. However, whether 
      findings from these trials are generalizable to the real world is uncertain. We 
      need reliable evidence on the real-world safety of these treatments to inform 
      decision making for clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Using lecanemab as an 
      exemplar, we outline the key considerations in designing and implementing an 
      observational study on safety and utilization outcomes using established 
      administrative healthcare claims data sources with the target trial emulation 
      framework. The target trial emulation framework is a rigorous causal inference 
      framework that minimizes common biases in observational studies. The approach 
      proposed here can be applied to evaluation of additional mAbs as they become 
      available. HIGHLIGHTS: Little is known about real-world safety of anti-amyloid 
      beta monoclonal antibodies for early Alzheimer's disease.Existing real-world data 
      can support studies of their safety and utilization outcomes.Target trial 
      emulation can guide the design of these studies while minimizing bias.We provide 
      key design and analytical considerations for future studies.

TI  - Long-Term Benefits and Safety of Statins in Patients with Kidney Failure: A 
      Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 882-889
LID - 10.1681/ASN.0000000554 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Patients with kidney failure are at a higher risk of cardiovascular 
      diseases, but the evidence for statin therapy remains inconclusive. The long-term 
      benefits and risks of statin therapy in patients with kidney failure were 
      analyzed using public electronic health records in Hong Kong. Statin therapy was 
      associated with a lower risk of major cardiovascular diseases and all-cause 
      mortality without a higher risk of major adverse events. BACKGROUND: Patients 
      with kidney failure are at elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases. Although 
      statins are commonly used to mitigate cardiovascular risk among the population 
      with high risk, the evidence for initiating statin therapy among patients with 
      kidney failure remains inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the 
      long-term benefits and risks associated with statin therapy in patients with 
      kidney failure. METHODS: Using territory-wide public electronic health records in 
      Hong Kong, 3019 statin-eligible individuals with kidney failure and elevated LDL 
      cholesterol ≥100 mg/dl from January 2008 to December 2015 were included for 
      analysis. The framework of target trial emulation was adopted to investigate the 
      risk of the major cardiovascular diseases (i.e., a composite of myocardial 
      infarction, heart failure, and stroke), all-cause mortality, and major adverse 
      events (i.e., myopathies and liver dysfunction) between statin initiators and 
      statin noninitiators. The pooled logistic model was used to obtain the hazard 
      ratio for the outcomes of interest in both intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 
      per-protocol (PP) analysis. RESULTS: Significant risk reduction associated with 
      statin therapy (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) was observed for major 
      cardiovascular diseases (ITT: 0.78 [0.62 to 0.98]; PP: 0.66 [0.50 to 0.87]) and 
      all-cause mortality (ITT: 0.80 [0.68 to 0.95]; PP: 0.60 [0.48 to 0.76]). The 
      standardized 5- and 10-year absolute risk reduction in PP analysis was 7% (3% to 
      11%) and 11% (4% to 18%), respectively. No significant risks for the major 
      adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy was associated with 
      lower risks of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in patients with 
      kidney failure without a higher risk of major adverse events.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients under two 
      low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis strategies: standard dose 
      and variable dose (standard dose increased to intermediate dose in the presence 
      of laboratory abnormalities indicating an increased thrombosis risk). STUDY 
      DESIGN AND SETTING: Target trial emulation using observational data from 2,613 
      adults admitted with a COVID-19 diagnosis in Madrid, Spain between March 16 and 
      April 15, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,284 patients were eligible. Among 503 
      patients without increased baseline thrombotic risk, 28-day mortality risk (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]) was 9.0% (6.6, 11.7) under the standard dose strategy 
      and 5.6% (3.3, 8.3) under the variable dose strategy; risk difference 3.4% (95% 
      CI: -0.24, 6.9); mortality hazard ratio 1.61 (95% CI: 0.97, 2.89). Among 781 
      patients with increased baseline thrombotic risk, the 28-day mortality risk was 
      25.8% (22.7, 29.0) under the standard dose strategy and 18.1% (9.3, 28.9) under 
      the intermediate dose strategy; risk difference 7.7% (95% CI: -3.5, 17.2); 
      mortality hazard ratio 1.45 (95% CI: 0.81, 3.17). Major bleeding and LMWH-induced 
      coagulopathy were rare under all strategies. CONCLUSION: Escalating 
      anticoagulation intensity after signs of thrombosis risk may increase the 
      survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, effect estimates were 
      imprecise and additional studies are warranted.

TI  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist and reduced liver and non-liver 
      complications in adults with type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated 
      steatotic liver disease: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 1084-1099
LID - 10.3350/cmh.2024.1096 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Information about the association of glucagon-like peptide-1 
      receptor (GLP-1RA) with liver and non-liver complications is insufficient in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic dysfunction-associated 
      steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We conducted a target trial emulation study to 
      evaluate whether GLP-1RA decreases the risk of liver and non-liver outcomes. 
      METHODS: Patients with T2D and MASLD initiating GLP-1RA or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
      inhibitor (DPP-4i) were included from 2013 to 2022 in Merative™ Marketscan® 
      Research Databases. Primary outcomes included incidences of (1) hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis, and (2) cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), and non-liver cancer. Inverse probability of treatment 
      weighting was applied to balance baseline characteristics and Cox regression 
      models were conducted to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval 
      (CI). RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat design, GLP-1RA, compared with DPP-4i, 
      had a significantly lower incidence (per 1,000 person-years) of HCC (0.8 vs. 1.7; 
      HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39-0.71), of cirrhosis (29.3 vs. 32.9; HR 0.91, 95% CI 
      0.86-0.96), of CVD (57.2 vs. 73.9; HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86-0.95), of CKD (4.5 vs. 
      6.8; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64-0.84), and of non-liver cancer (16.9 vs. 22.9; HR 0.82, 
      95% CI 0.77-0.89). In the per-protocol design, significant inverse associations 
      for these study outcomes still were observed, with HR 0.60-0.77. CONCLUSION: In 
      this emulated target trial of nationwide patients with T2D and MASLD, GLP-1RA 
      use, when compared with DPP-4i, was associated with a significantly lower risk of 
      liver and non-liver complications.

TI  - Heterogeneous treatment effects of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is on risk of Alzheimer's 
      disease and related dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: Insights from a 
      real-world target trial emulation.
PG  - e70313

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) of 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) on the risk of Alzheimer's disease and 
      related dementias (ADRD). METHODS: This target trial emulation study included 
      adults (≥ 50 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and newly prescribed a GLP-1RA, 
      SGLT2i, or other second-line glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs). A doubly robust 
      learning approach was deployed to estimate the risk difference (RD) of ADRD and 
      identify key subgroups. RESULTS: Both GLP-1RAs (RD, -1.5%) and SGLT2is (-1.7%) 
      were associated with a reduced ADRD risk compared to other GLDs. Key subgroups 
      were determined based on cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular disease 
      (CeVD), chronic kidney disease, and Hispanic ethnicity. Patients with CVD and 
      CeVD had the greatest benefits from GLP-1RAs (-4.8%) and SGLT2is (-4.6%). No 
      overall difference was observed between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2i. DISCUSSION: These 
      findings suggest the importance of personalized treatment in diabetes management 
      regarding ADRD risk. HIGHLIGHTS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RAs) were associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease and 
      related dementias (ADRD), while the protective association varied across 
      subgroups defined by cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular disease 
      (CeVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Similarly, sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) were associated with a decreased risk of 
      ADRD, with the protective association varying among subgroups defined by CVD, 
      CeVD, and Hispanic ethnicity. There was no difference between GLP-1RAs and 
      SGLT2is in the risk of ADRD.

      inhibitors (SGLT2i) due to vascular remodeling effects have been demonstrated in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is unclear whether a similar benefit 
      may be seen for glaucoma. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 
      SGLT2i on the risk of glaucoma in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Target 
      trial emulation using observational data from multiple healthcare organizations. 
      METHODS: This population-based cohort study included adults with type 2 diabetes 
      in the United States who newly initiated treatment with SGLT2i, dipeptidyl 
      peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP1RA) between 2013 and 2023. Propensity score matching was conducted to 
      control for sociodemographic characteristics comorbidities, and concomitant use 
      of medications. The exposure considered was treatment with SGLT2i for type 2 
      diabetes, and the outcomes were new-onset glaucoma and its subtypes after 
      initiation of antidiabetic treatments. Subgroup analyses were performed to 
      evaluate the effect of individual SGLT2i on incident glaucoma. RESULTS: After 
      propensity score matching, 722,446 patients were included in the SGLT2i arm and 
      the DPP4i arm, respectively. Patients on SGLT2i, compared with those on DPP4i, 
      had a lower risk of glaucoma (hazard ratio [HR] 0.815, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 0.794, 0.837), including open-angle glaucoma (HR 0.755, 95% CI 0.729, 0.781) 
      and primary angle-closure glaucoma (HR 0.702, 95% CI 0.636, 0.781). Among all 
      SGLT2i, ertugliflozin (HR 0.668, 95% CI 0.512, 0.871) was associated with the 
      lowest risk of glaucoma, followed by empagliflozin (HR 0.727, 95% CI 0.696, 
      0.759), dapagliflozin (HR 0.814, 95% CI 0.774, 0.855), and canagliflozin (HR 
      0.893, 95% CI 0.862, 0.926). The protective effect of SGLT2i on glaucoma was 
      validated when compared with GLP1RA (HR 0.932, 95% CI 0.906, 0.959). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients on SGLT2i, including canagliflozin, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and 
      ertugliflozin, had a significantly lower risk of incident glaucoma compared to 
      those on DPP4i. SGLT2i demonstrated a protective effect for both open-angle 
      glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the difference between BNT162b2 and CoronaVac in vaccine 
      effectiveness and safety. METHODS: This target trial emulation study included 
      individuals aged ≥12 during 2022. Propensity score matching was applied to ensure 
      group balance. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare the 
      effectiveness outcomes including COVID-19 infection, severity, 28-day 
      hospitalization, and 28-day mortality after infection. Poisson regression was 
      used for safety outcomes including 32 adverse events of special interests between 
      groups. RESULTS: A total of 639,818 and 1804,388 individuals were identified for 
      the 2-dose and 3-dose comparison, respectively. In 2-dose and 3-dose comparison, 
      the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were 0.844 [0.833-0.856] and 
      0.749 [0.743-0.755] for COVID-19 infection, 0.692 [0.656-0.731] and 0.582 
      [0.559-0.605] for hospitalization, 0.566 [0.417-0.769] and 0.590 [0.458-0.76] for 
      severe COVID-19, and 0.563 [0.456-0.697] and 0.457 [0.372-0.561] for mortality 
      for BNT162b2 recipients versus CoronaVac recipients, respectively. Regarding 
      safety, 2-dose BNT162b2 recipients had a significantly higher incidence of 
      myocarditis (incidence rate ratio [IRR] [95% CI]: 8.999 [1.14-71.017]) versus 
      CoronaVac recipients, but the difference was insignificant in 3-dose comparison 
      (IRR [95% CI]: 2.000 [0.500-7.996]). CONCLUSION: BNT162b2 has higher 
      effectiveness among individuals aged ≥12 against COVID-19-related outcomes for 
      SARS-CoV-2 omicron compared to CoronaVac, with almost 50% lower mortality risk.

TI  - Fusion versus decompression alone for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis and 
      spinal stenosis: a target trial emulation with index trial benchmarking.
PG  - 4281-4291
LID - 10.1007/s00586-024-08495-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The value of adding fusion to decompression surgery for lumbar 
      degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal canal stenosis remains debated. 
      Therefore, the comparative effectiveness and selected healthcare resource 
      utilization of patients undergoing decompression with or without fusion surgery 
      at 3 years follow-up was assessed. METHODS: Using observational data from the 
      Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study and a target trial emulation with index trial 
      benchmarking approach, our study assessed the comparative effectiveness of the 
      two main surgical interventions for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis-fusion 
      and decompression alone in patients with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis 
      and spinal canal stenosis. The primary outcome-measure was change in 
      health-related quality of life (EuroQol Health Related Quality of Life 
      5-Dimension 3-Level questionnaire [EQ-5D-3L]); secondary outcome measures were 
      change in back/leg pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale), change in satisfaction 
      (Spinal Stenosis Measure satisfaction subscale), physical therapy and oral 
      analgesic use (healthcare utilization). RESULTS: 153 patients underwent 
      decompression alone and 62 had decompression plus fusion. After inverse 
      probability weighting, 137 patients were included in the decompression alone 
      group (mean age, 73.9 [7.5] years; 77 female [56%]) and 36 in the decompression 
      plus fusion group (mean age, 70.1 [6.7] years; 18 female [50%]). Our findings 
      were compatible with no standardized mean differences in EQ-5D-3L summary index 
      change score at 3 years (EQ-5D-3L German: 0.07 [95% confidence interval (CI), 
      - 0.25 to 0.39]; EQ-5D-3L French: 0.18 [95% CI, - 0.14 to 0.50]). No 
      between-group differences in change in back/leg pain intensity or satisfaction 
      were found. Decompression plus fusion was associated with greater physical 
      therapy utilization at 3 years follow-up. CONCLUSION: Decompression alone should 
      be considered the primary option for patients with lumbar degenerative 
      spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis.

TI  - Efficacy, Safety, and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Ceftazidime-Avibactam versus 
      Polymyxin B in the Treatment of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
      Infections: A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 1419-1437
LID - 10.1007/s40121-025-01164-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) 
      infections are limited, with polymyxin B (PMB) and ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) 
      being among the available choices. However, research on these options is scarce 
      and significantly heterogeneous. This study aims to analyze the efficacy, safety, 
      and cost-effectiveness of PMB and CZA within a standardized target trial 
      emulation (TTE) framework. METHODS: This retrospective study emulated a target 
      trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of CZA versus PMB 
      for treating CRE infections. Conducted at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, this study 
      included adult patients treated with CZA or PMB from July 2020 to December 2022. 
      Data on demographics, treatment outcomes, and costs were collected. The primary 
      outcomes included clinical cure, incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and 
      cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes assessed 28-day all-cause mortality, 
      microbiological eradication rates, incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and 
      gastrointestinal events. The outcomes were assessed using the modified 
      intention-to-treat (mITT) effects, per-protocol effects, and propensity score 
      overlap weighting (PSOW) methods. RESULTS: Between July 1, 2020, and December 31, 
      2022, 492 hospitalized patients treated with CZA or PMB were screened at Nanjing 
      Drum Tower Hospital. Following inclusion and exclusion criteria, 176 patients 
      were included in the mITT analysis, and 153 in the per-protocol analysis. The 
      clinical cure rate was significantly higher in the CZA group compared to the PMB 
      group across all analyses. The 28-day mortality was similar between groups, while 
      the microbial eradication rate was significantly higher in the CZA group compared 
      to the PMB group across all analyses. The incidence of ADRs was consistent 
      between groups, but AKI occurred more frequently in PMB patients, while 
      gastrointestinal events were more common in the CZA group. The CZA strategy 
      demonstrated a 28.1% increase in efficacy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratio of 71,651.76 yuan. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these 
      findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that CZA has a higher clinical 
      cure rate compared to PMB within a standard TTE framework. However, the overall 
      incidence of ADRs was similar between the two treatments. Pharmacoeconomic 
      analysis also indicated that CZA is cost-effective. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Impact of early versus conventional kidney replacement therapy initiation in 
      tumor lysis syndrome: a target trial emulation.
PG  - 49
LID - 10.1186/s13613-025-01439-x [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), the optimal timing and 
      criteria for initiating kidney replacement therapy (KRT) remain unclear. This 
      study aims to assess the effect of initiating KRT at various phosphatemia 
      thresholds on Major Adverse Kidney Events at day 30 (MAKE30). METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We retrospectively emulated a pragmatic clinical trial comparing the 
      effect of KRT initiation at various phosphatemia thresholds versus a conventional 
      approach during TLS on MAKE30. All consecutive patients admitted to the ICU at 
      Saint-Louis University hospital in Paris and Angers University hospital between 
      January 2007 and June 2020, presenting with laboratory TLS were included. The 
      design criteria of a clinical trial were mimicked by using the cloning, censoring 
      and weighting method. The primary outcome was the MAKE30 composite outcome, 
      considering only KRT requirement between day 7 and day 30 for the dialysis 
      criteria. We evaluated multiple phosphatemia thresholds to guide KRT initiation, 
      ranging from 6.20 mg.dL(-1) to 9.30 mg.dL(-1). Among the initial population of 
      220 patients, 192 were included in the emulated trial (median age 60 years old, 
      with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Acute Leukemia being the most frequent 
      hematological malignancies). TLS-related AKI occurred in 140 patients, and 75 
      patients met the criteria for MAKE30. Regardless of the phosphate threshold 
      considered, KRT initiation based on phosphate level was not associated with a 
      significant difference in the MAKE30 rate. KRT requirement during the first 7 
      days (Odd Ratio [OR] 4.01 [1.65-4.86], p = 0.003) and non-renal SOFA (OR 1.39 per 
      1 point increment [1.25-1.57], p < 0.001) were identified as factors associated 
      with MAKE30 (multivariable analysis). CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the 
      strategy of KRT initiation based on a sole critical phosphatemia level in TLS 
      patients.

TI  - Long-term Cardiovascular, Renal, and Safety Outcomes of Teprotumumab versus 
      Systemic Glucocorticoids in Thyroid Eye Disease: A Target Trial Emulation.
LID - S0161-6420(25)00310-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ophtha.2025.05.012 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibitor teprotumumab is 
      effective for thyroid eye disease (TED), but there is limited evidence on its 
      long-term safety. We studied the long-term cardiovascular, renal, infectious, and 
      safety outcomes of teprotumumab compared with intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids 
      (GCs), oral GCs, and conservative treatment in patients with TED. DESIGN: 
      Population-based cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with TED who initiated 
      teprotumumab, GCs, or conservative treatment between January 1, 2020, and 
      December 1, 2024, from 80 health care organizations in the United States. 
      METHODS: Propensity scores were used to match baseline covariates including 
      demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data, and medications. Cox proportional 
      hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Outcomes included all-cause mortality and the risks of new-onset cardiovascular 
      diseases, renal diseases, infectious outcomes, and safety outcomes, including 
      hearing loss, within 5 years after initiating treatments. RESULTS: Teprotumumab 
      was associated with markedly lower all-cause mortality (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: 
      HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.65; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10-0.39) 
      and reduced risks of acute myocardial infarction (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 
      0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.95; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.91), 
      acute kidney failure (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.94; 
      teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.63), emergency department visits 
      (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38-0.60; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 
      0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.75), hospitalizations (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.31, 95% 
      CI 0.23-0.40; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26-0.45), urinary tract 
      infection (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.89; teprotumumab vs 
      oral GCs: HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.86), pneumonia (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.37, 
      95% CI 0.22-0.61; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20-0.53), and 
      severe sepsis (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.64; teprotumumab vs 
      oral GCs: HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.84). There was no difference in the risks of 
      diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or inflammatory bowel disease, or complications 
      requiring a hearing device, whereas there was a higher risk of hearing loss after 
      starting teprotumumab compared with GCs (teprotumumab vs IV GCs: HR 2.43, 95% CI 
      1.67-3.55; teprotumumab vs oral GCs: HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.65-3.44). All-cause 
      mortality was also markedly reduced in teprotumumab-treated patients when 
      compared with patients receiving conservative treatment (HR 0.24, 95% CI 
      0.13-0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with teprotumumab compared with IV or oral GCs 
      was associated with reduced risks of death and cardiovascular, renal, and 
      infectious outcomes in patients with TED. Teprotumumab may result in fewer 
      adverse outcomes than systemic GCs for treating TED. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S):

TI  - Comparison of Semaglutide or Dulaglutide Versus Empagliflozin for Risk for Death 
      and Cardiovascular Outcomes Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes : Two Target 
      Trial Emulation Studies.
PG  - 930-939
LID - 10.7326/ANNALS-24-00775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduction of premature death and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is a 
      key goal in type 2 diabetes management. OBJECTIVE: To compare mortality and 
      cardiovascular event risks in patients treated with semaglutide versus 
      empagliflozin and, secondarily, dulaglutide versus empagliflozin. DESIGN: Target 
      trial emulation studies from observational data comparing semaglutide- or 
      dulaglutide-treated patients with propensity score-matched patients treated with 
      empagliflozin. SETTING: Health care system of 703 academic and community clinical 
      practices. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 45 years or older with type 2 diabetes 
      treated from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2024 with semaglutide, dulaglutide, or 
      empagliflozin. INTERVENTION: Initial treatment with semaglutide, dulaglutide, or 
      empagliflozin. At baseline, concomitant treatment with other diabetes medication 
      was permitted, excluding other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. MEASUREMENTS: A composite of death, 
      myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke was the primary outcome, and secondary 
      composite outcomes included death or MI, MI or stroke, and individual cardiac 
      events. RESULTS: Patients treated with semaglutide (n = 7899) versus 
      empagliflozin (n = 7899) were followed for a median of 2.2 years; the respective 
      rates of the composite of death, MI, or stroke were 3.7% versus 4.5% at 2 years 
      and 5.9% versus 6.9% at 3 years. Corresponding incidence rates for the composite 
      outcome were 20.99 versus 23.56 per 1000 person-years, with a hazard ratio (HR) 
      of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.02). The HRs for the individual outcomes were 0.97 
      (CI, 0.81 to 1.15) for death, 0.85 (CI, 0.68 to 1.05) for MI, and 0.62 (CI, 0.43 
      to 0.89) for stroke. Risks for dulaglutide- and empagliflozin-treated patients 
      were similar for the composite outcome (HR, 1.03 [CI, 0.90 to 1.16]) and for 
      death, MI, and stroke separately. LIMITATION: Observational study design, lack of 
      data on cause-specific mortality, and residual confounding. CONCLUSION: 
      Semaglutide treatment seems to confer some advantage over empagliflozin. This 
      advantage was not observed for dulaglutide. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: American 
      Heart Association.

TI  - Risk of Nephrolithiasis Associated With SGLT2 Inhibitors Versus DPP4 Inhibitors 
      Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 193-201
LID - 10.2337/dc24-1652 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare the risk of nephrolithiasis among type 2 diabetes 
      patients who initiated sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) versus 
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4is), individually within stone never- and 
      ever-formers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the 2010-2021 Korea National 
      Health Insurance Service database, we conducted a population-based cohort study, 
      comparing initiators of SGLT2is versus DPP4is. The primary outcome was incident 
      nephrolithiasis. Osteoarthritis encounters served as a negative control outcome. 
      After 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching in stone never- and ever-formers, pooled 
      and individual hazard ratios (HRs), incidence rate difference (IRD), and 95% CIs 
      were reported. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, thiazide co-use, and baseline 
      cardiovascular risk were done. RESULTS: The 17,006 PS-matched pairs of SGLT2i and 
      DPP4i initiators were pooled from stone never-formers (105,378 pairs) and 
      ever-formers (11,628 pairs). Over a mean of 654 days, the risk of nephrolithiasis 
      was lower in SGLT2i initiators than in DPP4i initiators: 0.65 vs. 1.12 events per 
      100 person-years, HR 0.54 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57), IRD -0.46 (95% CI, -0.21 to 
      -0.52). Among never-formers, the HR was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.39-0.48) and IRD was 
      -0.32 (95% CI, -0.27 to -0.36). Among ever-formers, the HR was 0.64 (95% CI, 
      0.59-0.69) and IRD was -2.26 (95% CI, -1.77 to -2.76). Near-null associations 
      were found for osteoarthritis encounters. Results were consistent across 
      subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: We found a lower risk of nephrolithiasis associated with 
      SGLT2is versus DPP4is in stone never- and ever-formers. Despite a greater 
      relative risk reduction in the former, the absolute risk reduction was greater in 
      the latter.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 
      angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiovascular outcomes in older adults with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 194
LID - 10.1186/s12933-025-02753-1 [doi]
LID - 194
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II 
      receptor blockers (ARBs) are both recommended as first-line antihypertensive 
      agents for patients with diabetes. While pharmacological mechanisms suggest that 
      ACEIs may provide better cardiovascular protection than ARBs, this potential 
      benefit has not been fully established in previous observational studies of 
      patients with diabetes. METHODS: An active-comparator new-user design within 
      target trial emulation framework was implemented using Yinzhou Regional Health 
      Care Database (YRHCD). We compared risks of major cardiovascular events (MACE) 
      between older patients (age ≥ 65 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      newly exposed to ACEIs and ARBs from January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2023. The primary 
      outcomes were 3-point MACE, including hospitalized myocardial infarction, 
      hospitalized stroke, and all-cause mortality (a proxy for cardiovascular 
      mortality). We also assessed 4-point MACE, which further included hospitalized 
      heart failure. Propensity scores were calculated to balance 44 identified 
      confounders. Marginal structure models were applied to estimate per-protocol 
      hazard ratios. RESULTS: A total of 18,558 individuals were included, with 1,641 
      initiating ACEIs and 16,917 initiating ARBs. Their median age was 72 years and 
      45% were male. The adjusted hazard ratio for ACEIs vs. ARBs was 0.86 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.10) for 3-point MACE and 0.83 (95% CI 0.69-0.99) 
      for 4-point MACE. The 1-year absolute risk differences were - 0.30% (95% CI 
      - 1.80-1.21%) for 3-point MACE and - 1.16% (95% CI - 2.97-0.66%) for 4-point 
      MACE. Results were consistent across subgroup analyses (stratified by age, sex, 
      as well as baseline major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, 
      other antihypertensive therapy, insulin therapy, and calendar year) and 
      sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with T2DM, the initiation 
      of ACEIs was associated with a trend toward lower risk of MACE compared to ARBs, 
      implying the potential cardiovascular benefits of ACEIs in this population.

TI  - Using Trial and Observational Data to Assess Effectiveness: Trial Emulation, 
      Transportability, Benchmarking, and Joint Analysis.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1093/epirev/mxac011 [doi]
AB  - Comparisons between randomized trial analyses and observational analyses that 
      attempt to address similar research questions have generated many controversies 
      in epidemiology and the social sciences. There has been little consensus on when 
      such comparisons are reasonable, what their implications are for the validity of 
      observational analyses, or whether trial and observational analyses can be 
      integrated to address effectiveness questions. Here, we consider methods for 
      using observational analyses to complement trial analyses when assessing 
      treatment effectiveness. First, we review the framework for designing 
      observational analyses that emulate target trials and present an evidence map of 
      its recent applications. We then review approaches for estimating the average 
      treatment effect in the target population underlying the emulation, using 
      observational analyses of the emulation data alone and using transportability 
      analyses to extend inferences from a trial to the target population. We explain 
      how comparing treatment effect estimates from the emulation against those from 
      the trial can provide evidence on whether observational analyses can be trusted 
      to deliver valid estimates of effectiveness-a process we refer to as 
      benchmarking-and, in some cases, allow the joint analysis of the trial and 
      observational data. We illustrate different approaches using a simplified example 
      of a pragmatic trial and its emulation in registry data. We conclude that 
      synthesizing trial and observational data-in transportability, benchmarking, or 
      joint analyses-can leverage their complementary strengths to enhance learning 
      about comparative effectiveness, through a process combining quantitative methods 
      and epidemiologic judgments.

TI  - Comparative cardiometabolic safety and effectiveness of aripiprazole in people 
      with severe mental illness: A target trial emulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited and conflicting evidence on the comparative 
      cardiometabolic safety and effectiveness of aripiprazole in the management of 
      severe mental illness. We investigated the hypothesis that aripiprazole has a 
      favourable cardiometabolic profile, but similar effectiveness when compared to 
      olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted an 
      observational emulation of a head-to-head trial of aripiprazole versus 
      olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in UK primary care using data from the 
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We included adults diagnosed with severe 
      mental illness (i.e., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other non-organic 
      psychoses) who were prescribed a new antipsychotic between 2005 and 2017, with a 
      2-year follow-up to 2019. The primary outcome was total cholesterol at 1 year 
      (cardiometabolic safety). The main secondary outcome was psychiatric 
      hospitalisation (effectiveness). Other outcomes included body weight, blood 
      pressure, all-cause discontinuation, and mortality. Analyses adjusted for 
      baseline confounders, including sociodemographics, diagnoses, concomitant 
      medications, and cardiometabolic parameters. We included 26,537 patients 
      (aripiprazole, n = 3,573, olanzapine, n = 8,554, quetiapine, n = 8,289, 
      risperidone, n = 6,121). Median (IQR) age was 53 (42-67) years, 55.4% were 
      female, 82.3% White, and 18.0% were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Patients 
      prescribed aripiprazole had similar total cholesterol levels after 1 year to 
      those prescribed olanzapine (adjusted mean difference [aMD], -0.03, 95% CI, -0.09 
      to 0.02, p = 0.261), quetiapine (aMD, -0.03, 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.03, p = 0.324), 
      and risperidone (aMD, -0.01, 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.05, p = 0.707). However, there 
      was evidence that patients prescribed aripiprazole had better outcomes on other 
      cardiometabolic parameters, such as body weight and blood pressure, especially 
      compared to olanzapine. After additional adjustment for prior hospitalisation, 
      patients prescribed aripiprazole had similar rates of psychiatric hospitalisation 
      as those prescribed olanzapine (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.91, 95% CI, 0.82 
      to 1.01, p = 0.078), quetiapine (aHR, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.04, p = 0.230), or 
      risperidone (aHR, 1.01, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.12, p = 0.854). CONCLUSIONS: Data from 
      our large, powered, diverse, real-world target trial emulation sample, followed 
      over 2 years, suggest that adults diagnosed with severe mental illness prescribed 
      aripiprazole have similar total cholesterol 1 year after first prescription 
      compared to those prescribed olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. However, 
      patients prescribed aripiprazole had better outcomes on some other 
      cardiometabolic parameters, and there was little evidence of differences in 
      effectiveness. Our findings inform a common clinical dilemma and contribute to 
      the evidence base for real-world clinical decision-making on antipsychotic choice 
      for patients diagnosed with severe mental illness.

TI  - Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use improves clinical outcomes in 
      patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases: Target 
      trial emulation using real-world data.
LID - 10.1097/HEP.0000000000001333 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and 
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) prevent fibrosis progression in a preclinical 
      model of steatotic liver disease. Our objective was to assess the impact of 
      ACEi/ARB use on clinical outcomes in patients with metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using 
      TriNetX, a nationwide database, we identified all patients with metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases from January 1, 2011, to December 
      31, 2019. Using a target trial emulation framework, ACEi/ARB users were matched 
      with calcium channel blocker (CCB) users using propensity score matching (PSM). 
      Patients were followed up to 10 years after the index date. Cox proportional 
      hazards ﻿regression was used to determine the risk of mortality, major adverse 
      liver outcomes, major adverse cardiac events, and incident cancers. Of the 35,988 
      eligible patients, 28,423 were ACEi/ARB users, and 7565 were CCB users. After 
      PSM, 7238 pairs were well-balanced. ACEi/ARB use was associated with a 
      significantly decreased mortality risk (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.51-0.68). ACEi/ARB 
      was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing major adverse 
      liver outcomes (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61-0.80), including ascites (HR: 0.78, 95% 
      CI: 0.63-0.98) and HE (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57-0.78). ACEi/ARB use was also 
      associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 
      0.76-0.90) but not incident cancer (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.86-1.10) compared with 
      CCB. CONCLUSIONS: ACEi/ARB use in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated 
      steatotic liver diseases was associated with a reduced risk of mortality, major 
      adverse liver outcomes, and major adverse cardiac events compared with CCB use. A 
      large prospective study is needed for external validation.

TI  - Glucocorticoids versus glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide in eosinophilic 
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis without poor-prognosis factors: a target trial 
      emulation study.
LID - keaf256 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keaf256 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Current recommendations suggest treating eosinophilic granulomatosis 
      with polyangiitis (EGPA) without severe manifestations with glucocorticoids (GCs) 
      and EGPA with severe manifestations with GCs plus cyclophosphamide (CYC) 
      regardless of poor-prognostic factors. However, GCs plus CYC and GCs alone have 
      never been compared in EGPA without poor-prognosis factors assessed by the 1996 
      Five Factor Score (FFS). We aimed to compare the efficacy of GCs plus CYC vs GCs 
      alone for the treatment of EGPA without poor-prognosis, including among patients 
      with severe manifestations. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using 
      observational data from a European multicentre retrospective study. We included 
      patients with i) newly diagnosed EGPA, ii) a FFS =0 at diagnosis iii) and treated 
      with GCs or GCs plus CYC. Primary outcome was overall relapse at 12 months. 
      Inverse probability of treatment weighting-based analysis was used to adjust for 
      potential confounding factors. In a subgroup analysis, we focused on patients 
      with severe manifestations not included in the FFS. RESULTS: A total of 250 
      patients were included: 177 treated with GCs alone and 73 with GCs plus CYC. 
      After adjustment, no reduction in the risk of overall relapse was observed 
      between the two treatment groups. Similar results were observed in the subgroup 
      of patients with severe manifestations. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the 
      adjunction of CYC to GCs does not reduce the risk of relapse in patients with 
      EGPA and no poor-prognosis factors. It supports current guidelines in patients 
      without severe manifestations but challenges the need of CYC adjunction in 
      patients with severe manifestations but no poor-prognosis factors.

TI  - Effectiveness and safety of using statin therapy for the primary prevention of 
      cardiovascular diseases in older patients with chronic kidney disease who are 
      hypercholesterolemic: a target trial emulation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There remains a scarcity of evidence on initiating statin therapy for 
      the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases among older adults with chronic 
      kidney disease due to the under-representation of this population in randomised 
      controlled trials. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 
      using statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in 
      older adults (aged 75-84 years) and very old adults (aged ≥85 years) with chronic 
      kidney disease. METHODS: Using territory-wide public electronic health records in 
      Hong Kong, patients older than 60 years with chronic kidney disease and with 
      hyperlipidaemia (defined as elevated LDL cholesterol of ≥2·6 mmol/L) were 
      identified for inclusion in the analyses and were included on a rolling basis in 
      each calendar month from January, 2008, to December, 2015. Patients were 
      categorised into different age groups (ie, 60-74 years, 75-84 years, and 
      ≥85 years) for analysis, and the 60-74 years age group was used as a benchmark 
      group to test the validity of our emulated trial since the effect of statin 
      therapy is well established in this age group. The framework of target trial 
      emulation was adopted to investigate the association between statin therapy and 
      the risk of overall cardiovascular disease incidence, specific cardiovascular 
      disease subtypes (ie, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke), and 
      all-cause mortality, as well as major adverse events (ie, myopathies and liver 
      dysfunction). The primary outcome was overall cardiovascular disease incidence. 
      The hazard ratios for the outcomes were estimated by pooled logistic models in 
      the intention-to-treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis. FINDINGS: 711 966 
      person-trials from 96 trials were eligible for inclusion in the study. 
      19 423 unique individuals with chronic kidney disease aged 60-74 years, 
      22 565 unique individuals with chronic kidney disease aged 75-84 years, and 
      8811 unique individuals with chronic kidney disease aged 85 years and older were 
      identified for inclusion in the analyses. In patients aged 75-84 years, a 
      significant risk reduction was observed for overall cardiovascular disease 
      incidence in both the intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0·94 [95% CI 
      0·89-0·99]) and in the per-protocol analysis (0·86 [0·80-0·92]) and for all-cause 
      mortality (0·87 [0·82-0·91] in the intention-to-treat analysis and 
      0·78 [0·72-0·84] in the per-protocol analysis). This risk reduction was also 
      observed among patients aged 85 years and older for cardiovascular diseases (HR 
      0·88 [0·79-0·99] in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0·81 [0·71-0·92] in the 
      per-protocol analysis), and for all-cause mortality (0·89 [0·81-0·98] in the 
      intention-to-treat analysis and 0·80 [0·71-0·91] in the per-protocol analysis). 
      Substantial risk reduction for myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke 
      were also observed across all age groups. No significantly increased risk of 
      myopathies or liver dysfunction was observed in any of the age groups. 
      INTERPRETATION: Statin therapy is beneficial for hypercholesterolemic older 
      patients with chronic kidney disease aged 75 years and older regarding the 
      primary prevention against cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality, 
      without posing an increased risk of major adverse events. The benefits and safety 
      persist in those aged 85 years and older. FUNDING: National Natural Science

TI  - Impact of Early Resumption of Oral Anticoagulation on Recurrence After Surgery 
      for Chronic Subdural Hematoma in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Target 
      Trial Emulation.
PG  - e70063
LID - 10.1002/pds.70063 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Clinicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on oral 
      anticoagulants who undergo surgery for chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) face a 
      dilemma: while early postoperative resumption of anticoagulation is necessary to 
      prevent embolism, it may increase the risk of CSDH recurrence. To date, however, 
      no study has evaluated this question while adequately addressing common biases in 
      observational studies. Here, we assessed this issue using target trial emulation 
      framework. METHODS: We identified patients undergoing initial CSDH surgery who 
      had received anticoagulation for AF preoperatively from two hospital-based 
      administrative databases (2014-2022). We compared two treatment strategies: 
      resumption of anticoagulation within 14 days postoperatively versus no resumption 
      during this period. Using a three-step method of cloning, censoring, and 
      weighting, we estimated the risk of CSDH recurrence, along with the risk ratio 
      and risk difference at postoperative day 90. RESULTS: 291 CSDH patients with AF 
      were eligible, of whom 29 (10.0%) underwent CSDH reoperation. The weighted 
      estimated 90-day reoperation risk was 11.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0 to 
      14.3) for resuming anticoagulation within 14 days postoperatively and 9.4% (95% 
      CI, 4.1 to 12.8) for not resuming within 14 days, corresponding to a risk ratio 
      of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.67 to 2.36) and risk difference of 1.9% (95% CI, -4.0 to 6.6). 
      CONCLUSIONS: 90-day risk of CSDH recurrence may not differ between early and 
      non-early resumption of anticoagulation, although early resumption could modestly 
      accelerate recurrence. Allowing for the imprecision of the estimates, these 
      findings provide important insights for clinical decision-making regarding 
      anticoagulation resumption.

TI  - Estimating the Effect of Adhering to the Recommendations of the 2019 Canada's 
      Food Guide on Health Outcomes in Older Adults: Protocol for a Target Trial 
      Emulation.
PG  - e65182
LID - 10.2196/65182 [doi]
LID - e65182
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2019 Canada's Food Guide provides universal recommendations to 
      individuals aged ≥2 years. However, the extent to which these recommendations are 
      appropriate for older adults is unknown. Although ideal, conducting a large 
      randomized controlled trial is unrealistic in the short term. An alternative is 
      the target trial emulation framework for causal inference, a novel approach to 
      improve the analysis of observational data. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to 
      describe the protocol for a target trial emulation in older adults, with an 
      emphasis on key aspects of a hypothetical sustained diet and physical activity 
      intervention. METHODS: To emulate the target trial, nonexperimental data from the 
      Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge; N=1753 adults 
      aged ≥67 years) will be used. NuAge includes 4 yearly measurements of dietary 
      intakes, covariates, and outcomes. The per-protocol causal contrast will be the 
      primary causal contrast of interest to account for nonadherence. The sustained 
      intervention strategy will be modeled using the parametric g-formula. In the 
      hypothetical trial, participants will be instructed to meet sex-specific minimal 
      intakes for vegetables and fruits, whole grains, animal- and plant-based protein 
      foods, milk and plant-based beverages, and unsaturated fats. The eligibility 
      criteria, follow-up, intervention, outcomes, and causal contrast in the emulation 
      will closely align with those of the target trial, with only minor modifications. 
      We will attempt to emulate the randomization of treatment by adjusting for 
      baseline covariates and prebaseline dietary habits. RESULTS: Data collection for 
      NuAge was completed in June 2008. For this study, the main analysis was started 
      in May 2024. Submission of the manuscript is expected by February 2025. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Emulating a target trial will provide the first evidence of the 
      adequacy of the 2019 Canada's Food Guide recommendations for older adults in 
      relation to health outcomes. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

      hemoglobinopathy, is characterized by painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) that 
      can require hospitalization. Patients admitted with VOEs are often initially 
      resuscitated with normal saline (NS) to improve concurrent hypovolemia, despite 
      preclinical evidence that NS may promote erythrocyte sickling. The comparative 
      effectiveness of alternative volume-expanding fluids (eg, lactated Ringer [LR]) 
      for resuscitation during VOEs is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness 
      of LR to NS fluid resuscitation in patients with SCD and VOEs. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study and target trial emulation 
      included inpatient adults with SCD VOEs who received either LR or NS on hospital 
      day 1. The Premier PINC AI database (2016-2022), a multicenter clinical database 
      including approximately 25% of US hospitalizations was used. The analysis took 
      place between October 6, 2023, and June 20, 2024. EXPOSURE: Receipt of LR 
      (intervention) or NS (control) on hospital day 1. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome was hospital-free days (HFDs) by day 30. Targeted maximum 
      likelihood estimation was used to calculate marginal effect estimates. 
      Heterogeneity of treatment effect was explored in subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 
      55 574 patient encounters where LR (n = 3495) or NS (n = 52 079) was administered 
      on hospital day 1 were included; the median (IQR) age was 30 (25-37) years. 
      Patients who received LR had more HFDs compared with those who received NS 
      (marginal mean difference, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6 days). Patients who received LR 
      also had shorter hospital lengths of stay (marginal mean difference, -0.4; 95% 
      CI, -0.7 to -0.1 days) and lower risk of 30-day readmission (marginal risk 
      difference, -5.8%; 95% CI, -9.8% to -1.8%). Differences in HFDs between LR and NS 
      were heterogenous based on fluid volume received: among patients who received 
      less than 2 L, there was no difference in LR vs NS; among those who received 2 or 
      more L, LR was superior to NS. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found 
      that, compared with NS, LR had a small but significant improvement in HFDs and 
      secondary outcomes including 30-day readmission. These results suggest that, 
      among patients with VOEs in whom clinicians plan to give volume resuscitation 
      fluids on hospital admission, LR should be preferred over NS.

AB  - Currently there is a lack of randomized trial data examining the use of the 
      antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in paediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. This target trial emulation study aims to address this gap by 
      evaluating the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in non-hospitalized paediatric 
      patients aged 12-17 years with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection. Among 
      paediatric patients diagnosed between 16th March 2022 and 5th February 2023, 
      exposure was defined as outpatient nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment within 5 days 
      of symptom onset or COVID-19 diagnosis. Primary outcome was 28 day all-cause 
      mortality or all-cause hospitalization, while secondary outcomes were 28 day 
      in-hospital disease progression, 28 day COVID-19-specific hospitalization, 
      multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), acute liver injury, acute 
      renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, 49,378 eligible 
      paediatric patients were included. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was 
      associated with reduced 28 day all-cause hospitalization (absolute risk 
      reduction = 0.23%, 95%CI = 0.19%-0.31%; relative risk = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.56-0.71). 
      No events of mortality, in-hospital disease progression, or adverse clinical 
      outcomes were observed among nirmatrelvir/ritonavir users. The findings confirmed 
      the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in reducing all-cause hospitalization 
      risk among non-hospitalized pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant 
      infection.

TI  - Extended versus Standard Proning Duration for COVID-19-associated Acute 
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 1449-1457
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.202404-380OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Prone positioning for ⩾16 hours in moderate-to-severe acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) improves survival. However, the optimal 
      duration of proning is unknown. Objectives: To estimate the effect of extended 
      versus standard proning duration on patients with moderate-to-severe coronavirus 
      disease (COVID-19) ARDS. Methods: Data were extracted from a five-hospital 
      electronic medical record registry. Patients who were proned within 72 hours of 
      mechanical ventilation were categorized as receiving extended (⩾24 h) versus 
      standard (16-24 h) proning based on the first proning session length. We used a 
      target trial emulation design to estimate the effect of extended versus standard 
      proning on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality and secondary outcomes of 
      ventilator liberation and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Analytically, we 
      used inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) Cox or Fine-Gray regression 
      models. Results: A total of 314 patients were included; 234 received extended 
      proning, and 80 received standard-duration proning. Patients who received 
      extended proning were older, had greater comorbidity, were more often at an 
      academic hospital, and had shorter time from admission to mechanical ventilation. 
      After IPTW, characteristics were well balanced. Unadjusted 90-day mortality in 
      the extended versus standard proning groups was 39% versus 58%. In doubly robust 
      IPTW analyses, we found no significant effects of extended versus standard 
      proning duration on mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.95 
      [0.51-1.77]), ventilator liberation (subdistribution hazard, 1.60 [0.97-2.64], or 
      ICU discharge (subdistribution hazard, 1.31 [0.82-2.10]). Conclusions: Using 
      target trial emulation, we found no significant effect of extended versus 
      standard proning duration on mortality, ventilator liberation, or ICU discharge. 
      However, given the imprecision of estimates, further study is justified.

TI  - Carfilzomib's Real-World Safety Outcomes in Korea: Target Trial Emulation Study 
      Using Electronic Health Records.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph192013560 [doi]
LID - 13560
AB  - Carfilzomib is a promising anticancer drug for relapsed/refractory multiple 
      myeloma (RRMM). However, real-world evidence has only investigated the 
      cardiovascular safety of carfilzomib, and there is a high demand for thorough 
      safety evaluations. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the risk of adverse 
      events associated with carfilzomib in Korean patients with RRMM. We followed up 
      with 138 matched patients with RRMM (69 KRd (carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and 
      dexamethasone) and 69 Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) users). A total of 12 
      adverse events were evaluated. More than 75% of adverse events occurred during 
      the early cycle (1-6 cycles), and the incidence rate showed a tendency to 
      decrease in the later cycle (7-12 and 13-18 cycles). Severities of most adverse 
      events were evaluated as grade 1-2. The KRd regimen were related with 
      significantly increased risks of dyspnea (adjusted HR (aHR) 2.27, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 1.24-4.16), muscle spasm (aHR 5.12, 95% CI 1.05-24.9) and 
      thrombocytopenia (aHR 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.06). Although the severities were low, 
      carfilzomib has many side effects in treating RRMM; hence, findings on the 
      patterns of its adverse events could lead to both effective and safe use of KRd 
      therapy in real-world settings.

TI  - Safety of beta-blocker discontinuation after acute coronary syndromes with 
      preserved or mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction: a target trial 
      emulation from a real-world cohort.
PG  - 622-632
LID - 10.1093/eurjpc/zwae346 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The benefit of long-term beta-blocker therapy after acute coronary 
      syndromes (ACS) without heart failure in the reperfusion era is uncertain. Two 
      recent randomized trials found conflicting results. The present study assessed 
      the safety of beta-blocker discontinuation within 12 months following ACS with 
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥40%. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a 
      multicentre prospective real-world cohort (n = 3762) of patients hospitalized for 
      ACS, patients with LVEF ≥40% and beta-blockers at discharge were included. 
      Patients who continued beta-blockers at 1 year were compared with those who 
      discontinued beta-blockers within 12 months post-ACS using target trial emulation 
      and inverse probability weighting over an additional 4-year follow-up. The 
      primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of 
      4-year cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischaemic 
      attack, unplanned coronary revascularization, or unstable angina hospitalization. 
      Of 2077 patients, 1758 (85%) continued beta-blockers and 319 (15%) had 
      discontinued beta-blockers at 1 year. The risk of the primary endpoint was 
      similar in both groups [14.1 vs. 14.3% with beta-blocker discontinuation vs. 
      continuation; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 
      0.72-1.34, P = 0.91]. Subgroup analysis suggested a higher risk of primary 
      endpoint with beta-blocker discontinuation after STEMI [aHR = 1.46 (0.99-2.16)] 
      compared with NSTEMI [aHR = 0.70 (0.40-1.22), Pinteraction = 0.033], whereas 
      there was no interaction with LVEF (Pinteraction = 0.68). CONCLUSION: 
      Beta-blocker discontinuation within 12 months following ACS with LVEF ≥40% was 
      not associated with an increased risk of MACE compared with long-term 
      beta-blocker therapy. Subgroup analysis suggested potential risk in STEMI 
      patients. Discontinuing beta-blockers 12 months after ACS appears safe in 
      patients with LVEF ≥40%, particularly after NSTEMI.

OAB - Beta-blockers are part of the standard drug therapy prescribed to prevent adverse 
      health events in patients who suffered from myocardial infarction. However, the 
      studies that established their benefit were conducted before the advent of modern 
      therapies, which have since then dramatically changed the prognosis. The benefit 
      of long-term beta-blockers in the contemporary era has therefore been questioned. 
      The present study assessed the safety of beta-blocker discontinuation within 12 
      months after myocardial infarction in patients who did not have severely impaired 
      heart function. Beta-blocker discontinuation within 12 months after myocardial 
      infarction was safe, as it was not associated with a higher risk of major adverse 
      cardiovascular events or death, compared with long-term beta-blocker 
      continuation. Patients who presented with acute occlusion of a coronary artery—a 
      severe type of myocardial infarction referred to as ‘ST-elevation myocardial 
      infarction’—may still benefit from long-term beta-blocker therapy based on 
      subgroup analysis.

TI  - Effectiveness of Remdesivir Treatment Protocols Among Patients Hospitalized with 
      COVID-19: A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 365-375
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001598 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is recommended for certain hospitalized patients with 
      COVID-19. However, these recommendations are based on evidence from small 
      randomized trials, early observational studies, or expert opinion. Further 
      investigation is needed to better inform treatment guidelines with regard to the 
      effectiveness of remdesivir among these patients. METHODS: We emulated a 
      randomized target trial using chargemaster data from 333 US hospitals from 1 May 
      2020 to 31 December 2021. We compared three treatment protocols: remdesivir 
      within 2 days of hospital admission, no remdesivir within the first 2 days of 
      admission, and no remdesivir ever. We used baseline comorbidities recorded from 
      encounters up to 12 months before admission and identified the use of in-hospital 
      medications, procedures, and oxygen supplementation from charges. We estimated 
      the cumulative incidence of mortality or mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation with an inverse probability of censoring weighted estimator. 
      We conducted analyses in the total population as well as in subgroups stratified 
      by level of oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: A total of 274,319 adult patients 
      met the eligibility criteria for the study. Thirty-day in-hospital mortality risk 
      differences for patients adhering to the early remdesivir protocol were -3.1% 
      (95% confidence interval = -3.5%, -2.7%) compared to no early remdesivir and 
      -3.7% (95% confidence interval -4.2%, -3.2%) compared to never remdesivir, with 
      the strongest effect in patients needing high-flow oxygen. For mechanical 
      ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, risk differences were minimal. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that, among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 
      remdesivir treatment within 2 days of admission reduced 30-day in-hospital 
      mortality, particularly for patients receiving supplemental oxygen on the day of 
      admission.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of rituximab and cladribine in relapsing-remitting 
      multiple sclerosis: A target trial emulation.
PG  - 975-984
LID - 10.1177/13524585251342727 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Head-to-head comparisons of high-efficacy therapies for 
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are lacking. We conducted a target 
      trial emulation to compare the long-term effectiveness of rituximab and 
      cladribine. METHODS: We estimated the effect of initiating treatment with 
      rituximab versus cladribine using observational data from the Norwegian MS 
      Registry and Biobank at two university hospitals with different treatment 
      strategies. Cumulative incidence and risk differences (RDs) were estimated using 
      weighted Kaplan-Meier estimators, adjusting for baseline covariates. The primary 
      outcome was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity, with secondary 
      outcomes including relapses and safety. RESULTS: The study included 285 patients, 
      159 receiving rituximab and 126 cladribine, with a median follow-up of 4.5 years 
      (interquartile range (IQR): 4.2-4.7). The 4-year risk of new MRI disease activity 
      was 17% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11-23) for rituximab-treated patients and 
      57% (95% CI: 44-66) for cladribine-treated patients, yielding an RD of 40 
      percentage-points (95% CI: 28-50). The 4-year RD for relapse was 12 
      percentage-points (95% CI: 4-19). The incidence of hospitalizations related to 
      potential adverse events was 6.0 per 100 person-years for rituximab and 4 per 100 
      person-years for cladribine. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that rituximab 
      has superior effectiveness compared to cladribine during a median follow-up of 
      4.5 years.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus 
      buprenorphine-naloxone on treatment interruption: Comparing findings from a 
      reanalysis of the X:BOT RCT and harmonized target trial emulation using 
      population-based observational data.
PG  - 1634-1645
LID - 10.1111/add.70040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is unclear if findings from randomized controlled trials 
      (RCT) of medications for opioid use disorder apply to real-world settings. We 
      estimated the effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) versus 
      extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) on treatment interruption in a RCT and an 
      observational study based on real-world data. DESIGN: Target trial emulation to 
      harmonize the protocol and statistical analyses of X:BOT (target trial) and the 
      observational study (observational emulation). Baseline was randomization in the 
      target trial and medically managed opioid withdrawal (MMOW) discharge in the 
      observational emulation. SETTINGS: X:BOT trial and Massachusetts Public Health 
      Data Warehouse observational data (United States). PARTICIPANTS: The target trial 
      included all X:BOT participants. The observational emulation trial included MMOW 
      discharges from January 2014 to May 2016. MEASUREMENTS: Treatment strategies were 
      BUP-NX versus XR-NTX initiation within 28 days of baseline. The outcome was 
      treatment interruption (earliest of treatment discontinuation, incarceration, 
      MMOW readmission, death). We estimated the 24-week risk and risk difference. 
      FINDINGS: In the target trial, 94% (269/287) and 66% (187/283) of participants 
      randomized to BUP-NX or XR-NTX initiated their assigned treatment within 28 days, 
      respectively. In the observational emulation, BUP-NX and XR-NTX were initiated 
      within 28 days in 9% (5209/59 076) and 3% (1813/59 076) of MMOW discharges, 
      respectively. The adjusted 24-week treatment interruption risks (95% confidence 
      interval) for BUP-NX and XR-NTX were 68% (60%,77%) and 72% (60%,83%) in the 
      target trial [risk difference, -4 percentage points (pp; -17 pp,11 pp)] and 82% 
      (81%,83%) and 93% (92%,95%) in the observational emulation [risk 
      difference,-11 pp (-13 pp,-10 pp)]. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine-naloxone might be 
      superior to extended-release naltrexone in real-world settings where the majority 
      of people struggle to remain on medications for opioid use disorder. 
      Buprenorphine-naloxone initiators had a lower risk of treatment interruption than 
      extended-release naltrexone initiators in an observational emulation, but similar 
      risks in a randomized controlled trial, although confidence intervals were wide. 
      Trial participation, study size and residual confounding may explain these 
      differences.

TI  - Exploring the Application of Target Trial Emulation in Vaccine Evaluation: 
      Scoping Review.
LID - kwaf053 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwaf053 [doi]
AB  - Target trial emulation (TTE) has gained popularity in evaluating treatments and 
      health interventions. Its application to infectious disease outcomes requires 
      careful consideration, as infectious disease transmission violates the assumption 
      of no interference. Thus, we conducted a scoping review to understand how TTE 
      approaches have been applied to vaccine evaluation. We searched literature 
      published in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science until May 2024, using keywords 
      related to TTE, infectious diseases, and vaccines. Full-text articles meeting 
      inclusion criteria were further assessed for eligibility. Our keyword-based 
      search and citation search identified a total of 241 studies. Of these, 35 
      original research studies used TTE approaches to evaluate vaccines, predominantly 
      published from 2022 to 2024. The majority (n=32, 91%) evaluated the effect of 
      COVID-19 vaccines, with one study each evaluating influenza, mpox, and rotavirus 
      vaccines. Most studies did not define which of the four effects of vaccination 
      they evaluated (direct, indirect, total, or overall effect), and none 
      incorporated interference in vaccine evaluation. Our review highlights the 
      increasing popularity of TTE in vaccine evaluation following the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Further discussions are needed to establish TTE approaches to 
      estimating four effects of vaccination, using large, routinely collected data.

TI  - Effectiveness of Specific Health Check-ups in Japan for the primary prevention of 
      obesity-related diseases: a protocol for a target trial emulation.
PG  - e070417
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-070417 [doi]
LID - e070417
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Concerns about public health threats have shifted towards 
      obesity-related, non-communicable diseases in both developed and developing 
      countries. Since 2008, Japan has adopted a nationwide universal screening 
      programme called Specific Health check-ups (SHC) for the primary prevention of 
      obesity-related, non-communicable diseases, namely, diabetes, hypertension and 
      hyperlipidaemia. The effectiveness of SHC has not been systemically evaluated to 
      date. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use the employment-based health insurance 
      database, which includes both records of receipt versus non-receipt of SHC and 
      healthcare claims. The study design adopts the target trial emulation framework 
      to minimise the bias inherent to the observational study (eg, time-related bias 
      and its consequences). The key components of trial emulation-eligibility 
      criteria, treatment strategy, assignment procedure, follow-up period, outcome, 
      causal contrast of interest and analysis plan-are detailed, along with the ideal 
      target trial protocol. Briefly, we will conduct the nested-trial emulation 
      approach that allows multiple trial entries. Persons aged 40-74 years will be 
      eligible if they do not have a documented diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes 
      and a history of receiving SHC at baseline. Participants will be classified 
      according to the receipt or non-receipt of SHC service and followed for a maximum 
      of 10 years until the withdrawal from the insurance plan, the outcome occurrence 
      or the administrative censoring (the end of the available data, expected to be 
      March 2022), whichever comes first. The 10-year incidence of 
      diabetes/hypertension will be compared between SHC recipients and non-recipients 
      using pooled logistic regression with adjustments for baseline confounders. Five 
      sensitivity analyses are employed, including per-protocol analysis, changing 
      eligibility criteria and negative outcome control analysis. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: This protocol obtained the approval from Kyoto University Graduate 
      School and Faculty of Medicine, Ethics Committee (R2448). The findings will be 
      disseminated to academic conferences, and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Eliminating Food Insecurity in the USA: a Target Trial Emulation Using 
      Observational Data to Estimate Effects on Health-Related Quality of Life.
PG  - 2308-2317
LID - 10.1007/s11606-023-08095-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food insecurity is associated with many aspects of poor health. 
      However, trials of food insecurity interventions typically focus on outcomes of 
      interest to funders, such as healthcare use, cost, or clinical performance 
      metrics, rather than quality of life outcomes that may be prioritized by 
      individuals who experience food insecurity. OBJECTIVE: To emulate a trial of a 
      food insecurity elimination intervention, and quantify its estimated effects on 
      health utility, health-related quality of life, and mental health. DESIGN: Target 
      trial emulation using longitudinal, nationally representative data, from the USA, 
      2016-2017. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2013 adults in the Medical Expenditure Panel 
      Survey screened positive for food insecurity, representing 32 million 
      individuals. MAIN MEASURES: Food insecurity was assessed using the Adult Food 
      Security Survey Module. The primary outcome was the SF-6D (Short-Form Six 
      Dimension) measure of health utility. Secondary outcomes were mental component 
      score (MCS) and physical component score (PCS) of the Veterans RAND 12-Item 
      Health Survey (a measure of health-related quality of life), Kessler 6 (K6) 
      psychological distress, and Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item (PHQ2) depressive 
      symptoms. KEY RESULTS: We estimated that food insecurity elimination would 
      improve health utility by 80 QALYs per 100,000 person-years, or 0.008 QALYs per 
      person per year (95% CI 0.002 to 0.014, p = 0.005), relative to the status quo. 
      We also estimated that food insecurity elimination would improve mental health 
      (difference in MCS [95% CI]: 0.55 [0.14 to 0.96]), physical health (difference in 
      PCS: 0.44 [0.06 to 0.82]), psychological distress (difference in K6: -0.30 [-0.51 
      to -0.09]), and depressive symptoms (difference in PHQ-2: -0.13 [-0.20 to 
       -0.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity elimination may improve important, but 
      understudied, aspects of health. Evaluations of food insecurity interventions 
      should holistically investigate their potential to improve many different aspects 
      of health.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for 
      depression in 43,061 older adults with chronic somatic diseases: A Danish target 
      trial emulation study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of commonly used 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for comorbid depression in older 
      adults with chronic somatic diseases by applying a target-trial-emulation 
      framework. METHODS: Danish target-trial-emulation study including 43,061 
      individuals aged ≥65 years (54.1% females, mean age 77.8 years) with a first 
      redeemed prescription for depression with sertraline (n = 6673), escitalopram 
      (n = 7104) or citalopram (n = 29,284) in 2006-2017. Individuals had cancer, 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease 
      (COPD)/asthma, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, or osteoporosis. Outcomes 
      were treatment switching, combination/augmentation, psychiatric hospital contact 
      for depression, and any psychiatric in-patient care. Follow-up was one year and 
      adjusted Cox regression analyses calculated hazard rate ratios (HRR) within each 
      somatic disease. RESULTS: Across all six disease groups and four outcomes, we 
      found that citalopram use, compared with sertraline, was associated with lower 
      risks in several analyses, with statistically significant results in cancer, CVD, 
      COPD/asthma, and diabetes (e.g., HRRs for psychiatric hospital contacts for 
      depression/any psychiatric in-patient care ranging between 0.47 and 0.61). For 
      escitalopram, compared with sertraline, some analyses indicated poorer outcomes 
      with significantly higher risks for combination/augmentation treatment (HRRs 
      ranging between 1.15 and 1.40). CONCLUSIONS: Although observational studies are 
      prone to confounding, these findings indicate clinically relevant differences 
      between the SSRIs, with better outcomes in citalopram users and poorer outcomes 
      in escitalopram users than sertraline, urging the need for clinical studies in 
      this vulnerable patient population.

TI  - Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in hematological patients who 
      received or not pre-exposure prophylaxis with tixagevimab/cilgavimab: a target 
      trial emulation.
PG  - 1474-1481
LID - 10.1080/10428194.2024.2361099 [doi]
AB  - We emulated a hypothetical target trial in which hematological subjects cared at 
      the University Hospital of Pisa (Italy) received or not SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis 
      with tixagevimab/cilgavimab. Subjects who received prophylaxis (cases) were 
      compared to those who did not (controls). The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 
      infection in the subsequent 6 months. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was 
      used to adjust for confounders. A multivariable analysis was performed to 
      identify variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We recruited 462 
      patients: 228 received prophylaxis, 234 were controls. COVID-19 was lower in 
      cases compared to controls (16.7% vs 24.8%, p = 0.03, after IPW 14.3% vs 24.6%, 
      p = 0.01). On multivariable analysis, B-cell depleting therapies (HR 2.09, 95%CI 
      1.05-4.18, p = 0.037) were associated with increased risk of COVID-19, while 
      tixagevimab/cilgavimab prophylaxis (HR 0.45, 95%CI 0.27-0.73, p = 0.001) and 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 0.27, 95%CI 0.14-0.51, p < 0.001) were 
      protective. In conclusion, prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies may reduce the 
      risk of COVID-19 in hematological patients.

TI  - Beta-blocker initiation under dobutamine infusion in acute advanced heart 
      failure: a target trial emulation with observational data.
PG  - oeae054
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeae054 [doi]
LID - oeae054
AB  - AIMS: In patients with advanced heart failure requiring dobutamine infusion, it 
      is usually recommended to initiate beta-blockers after weaning from dobutamine. 
      However, beta-blockers are sometimes initiated under dobutamine infusion in a 
      real-world scenario. The association between such early beta-blocker initiation 
      with clinical outcomes is unknown. Therefore, this study investigates the 
      association between initiating beta-blockers under dobutamine infusion and 
      survival outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: This observational study with a 
      multicentre inpatient-care database emulated a pragmatic randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT) of the beta-blocker initiation strategy. First, 1151 patients on 
      dobutamine and not on beta-blockers on the day of heart failure admission (Day 0) 
      were identified. Among 1095 who met eligibility criteria, patients who were 
      eventually initiated beta-blockers under dobutamine infusion by Day 7 (early 
      initiation strategy) were 1:1 matched to those who were not initiated 
      (conservative strategy). The methods of cloning, censoring, and weighting were 
      applied to emulate the target trial. Patients were followed up for up to 30 days. 
      The primary outcome was all-cause death. Among 780 matched patients (median age, 
      81 years), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.75-1.64, 
      P = 0.59) for the early initiation strategy. The estimated 30-day all-cause 
      mortalities in the early initiation strategy and the conservative strategy were 
      19.3% (10.6-30.7) and 16.2% (9.2-25.3), respectively. The results were consistent 
      when we used different days to determine strategies (i.e. 5 and 9) instead of 7 
      days. CONCLUSION: The present observational study emulating a pragmatic RCT found 
      no positive or negative association between beta-blocker initiation under 
      dobutamine infusion and overall survival.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and osteoporosis: a target trial 
      emulation using real-world data.
PG  - e48
LID - 10.1017/neu.2025.3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated 
      with increased risk of osteoporosis, and sertraline may be more potent than 
      citalopram in this regard. Here, target trial emulation was used to investigate 
      whether sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram (the S-enantiomer of citalopram) 
      differentially affect the risk of osteoporosis. Subsequently, it was examined 
      whether SSRIs increase the risk of osteoporosis in a dose-response-like manner. 
      METHODS: Danish nationwide registers were used to identify all individuals that 
      initiated treatment for depression with sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram 
      between January 1, 2007, and March 1, 2019. These individuals were followed until 
      development of osteoporosis, death, or end of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards 
      regression was used to adjust for relevant baseline covariates to emulate 
      randomised treatment allocation to compare the rate of osteoporosis for 
      individuals treated with sertraline, citalopram or escitalopram. Subsequently, 
      the cumulative dose of sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram was calculated, 
      and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess dose-response-like 
      relationships with osteoporosis. RESULTS: We identified 27,280, 65,529, and 
      17,703 individuals initiating treatment with sertraline, citalopram, and 
      escitalopram, respectively. There was no material or statistically significant 
      differential risk of osteoporosis between these groups (adjusted hazard rate 
      ratio, aHRR = 0.98 for citalopram versus sertraline and aHRR = 0.94 for 
      escitalopram versus sertraline). The results were not indicative of the SSRIs 
      having a dose-response-like effect on osteoporosis risk. CONCLUSIONS: Sertraline, 
      citalopram and escitalopram do not appear to differentially affect the risk of 
      osteoporosis. The lack of clear dose-response-like relationships suggest that 
      they do not have a causal effect on osteoporosis risk.

TI  - Outcomes of Reinitiating Direct Oral Anticoagulants After 
      Intracranial Hemorrhage: A Sequential Target Trial Emulation Study.

LID - S2772-3747(24)00488-5 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether or not to reinitiate direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in 
      atrial fibrillation patients who survived an antithrombotic agent-associated 
      intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) event remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: The primary 
      purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of DOACs 
      after ICH, with the secondary objective to explore the optimal timing of DOAC 
      reinitiation. METHODS: A sequential target trial emulation study was conducted 
      using the National Health Insurance claims data in Taiwan. We included AF 
      patients receiving antithrombotic therapy who later developed an ICH event 
      between June 2012 and December 2018. Post-ICH DOAC reinitiation status was 
      assessed at 6 consecutive 14-day intervals after discharge. We further stratified 
      our analysis using the stroke severity index to explore the optimal timing of 
      DOAC reinitiation. Study outcomes were all-cause mortality, ICH, and ischemic 
      stroke. Adjusted HRs (aHRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. 
      RESULTS: DOAC reinitiation was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality 
      (aHR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.61-0.88) without increased ICH risk (aHR: 1.21; 95% CI: 
      0.81-1.80) compared with no antithrombotic therapy after ICH. The ischemic stroke 
      risk after reinitiating DOAC was similar to that with no antithrombotic therapy 
      (aHR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.47-1.14). Reinitiating DOACs within 14 and 28 days after 
      discharge most benefited patients with low and high ICH severity, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: DOAC is associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality. The 
      optimal timing of DOAC reinitiation varies by ICH severity, with later 
      reinitiation recommended for patients with higher ICH severity.

TI  - [Comparing the effectiveness of multiple dynamic treatment strategies using 
      target trial emulation].
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1007/s11553-023-01033-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions that are dependent on if-then rules on disease 
      status or prior treatment information are dynamic treatment decisions. The 
      effectiveness of dynamic treatment strategies is often investigated with 
      real-world data (RWD). As many different therapy strategies can be observed in 
      routine practice, RWD offer great potential. However, RWD are always associated 
      with risks for several biases including immortal time and selection bias. 
      OBJECTIVES: This article shows how to adequately compare dynamic treatment 
      strategies and identify the optimal strategy. A case study is used to illustrate 
      the causal approach described above. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe how the 
      combination of three counterfactual approaches allows causal interpretation of 
      results. We describe causal diagrams, target trial emulation, and g-methods. The 
      described causal approach is illustrated by a case study examining when antiviral 
      therapy should be initiated in treatment-naïve patients with human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. RESULTS: Causal diagrams visualize 
      underlying causal processes. They help to identify parameters that need to be 
      considered in the analysis. Target trial emulation simulates a randomized 
      clinical trial by defining all possible dynamic strategies, copying ("cloning") 
      patient data, and assigning each patient to each treatment arm. In a causal per 
      protocol analysis, all patients violating the protocol of a given treatment 
      strategy are censored. Informative censoring is adjusted by g-methods. The 
      expected outcomes of each treatment strategy are simulated and compared. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic treatment strategies can be adequately compared using RWD 
      when three causal approaches are combined, and the necessary data are available. 
      These approaches are (1) causal diagrams, (2) target trial emulation, and 
      (3) statistical g-methods.

TI  - Comparing the effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in 
      non-hospitalized and hospitalized COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes: A 
      target trial emulation study.

AB  - AIMS: To compare the effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for 
      non-hospitalized and hospitalized COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Territory-wide electronic health records in Hong Kong were 
      used to perform target trial emulation using a sequential trial approach. 
      Patients (1) aged ≥18 years, (2) with T2DM, (3) with COVID-19 infection, and (4) 
      who received molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of infection 
      between 16 March 2022 and 31 December 2022 in non-hospital and hospital settings 
      were included. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiators were matched 
      using one-to-one propensity-score matching and followed for 28 days. Risk of 
      outcomes was compared between groups by Cox regression adjusted for baseline 
      characteristics. Subgroup analyses were performed on age (<70 years, ≥70 years), 
      sex, Charlson comorbidity index (<4, ≥4), and number of COVID-19 vaccine doses 
      (<2 doses, ≥2 doses). RESULTS: Totals of 17 974 non-hospitalized (8987 in each 
      group) and 3678 hospitalized (1839 in each group) patients were identified. 
      Non-hospitalized nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiators had lower risk of all-cause 
      mortality (absolute risk reduction [ARR] at 28 days 0.80%, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 0.56-1.04; hazard ratio [HR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.73) and 
      hospitalization (ARR at 28 days 4.01%, 95% CI 3.19-4.83; HR 0.73, 95% CI 
      0.66-0.82) as compared with molnupiravir initiators. Hospitalized 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiators had reduced risk of all-cause mortality (ARR at 
      28 days 2.94%, 95% CI 1.65-4.23; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.80) as compared with 
      molnupiravir initiators. Consistent findings were found across all subgroups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be preferred to molnupiravir 
      for COVID-19 patients with T2DM and without contraindication to either treatment.

TI  - On the estimation of the effect of weight change on a health outcome using 
      observational data, by utilising the target trial emulation framework.
PG  - 1309-1317
LID - 10.1038/s41366-023-01396-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: When studying the effect of weight change between two time 
      points on a health outcome using observational data, two main problems arise 
      initially (i) 'when is time zero?' and (ii) 'which confounders should we account 
      for?' From the baseline date or the 1st follow-up (when the weight change can be 
      measured)? Different methods have been previously used in the literature that 
      carry different sources of bias and hence produce different results. METHODS: We 
      utilised the target trial emulation framework and considered weight change as a 
      hypothetical intervention. First, we used a simplified example from a 
      hypothetical randomised trial where no modelling is required. Then we simulated 
      data from an observational study where modelling is needed. We demonstrate the 
      problems of each of these methods and suggest a strategy. INTERVENTIONS: weight 
      loss/gain vs maintenance. RESULTS: The recommended method defines time-zero at 
      enrolment, but adjustment for confounders (or exclusion of individuals based on 
      levels of confounders) should be performed both at enrolment and the 1st 
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of our suggested method [adjusting for 
      (or excluding based on) confounders measured both at baseline and the 1st 
      follow-up] can help researchers attenuate bias by avoiding some common pitfalls. 
      Other methods that have been widely used in the past to estimate the effect of 
      weight change on a health outcome are more biased. However, two issues remain (i) 
      the exposure is not well-defined as there are different ways of changing weight 
      (however we tried to reduce this problem by excluding individuals who develop a 
      chronic disease); and (ii) immortal time bias, which may be small if the time to 
      first follow up is short.

TI  - Cataract Surgery and Incidence of Retinal Vascular Occlusion: Population-Based 
      Cohort Study Using a Target Trial Emulation Framework.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested an association between cataract surgery 
      and retinal vascular occlusion. However, the association may be attributable to 
      detection bias because postoperative monitoring may be more frequent for those 
      who receive cataract surgery than for those who do not. DESIGN: Population-based 
      cohort study using target trial emulation framework. METHODS: We included 
      patients with cataract aged 50 years and older receiving cataract surgery or 
      nonsurgical interventions identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance 
      Research Database between 2003 and 2018, matched by propensity score. The primary 
      outcome was retinal vascular occlusion. Cox proportional hazards models were used 
      to compare surgery and control groups. Additional analyses were restricted to 
      patients who had undergone fundoscopic examination within 6 months prior to 
      cataract surgery to address the issue of detection bias. RESULTS: We included 
      577,129 cataract surgery and control pairs. We found the hazard ratio (HR) for 
      retinal vascular occlusion after cataract surgery was 1.23 (95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.17-1.29), compared with the control group. Secondary outcome 
      analyses yielded similar results for retinal artery occlusion (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 
      1.02-1.26) and retinal vein occlusion (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.20-1.33). However, no 
      risk of retinal vascular occlusion was observed among patients who had received 
      fundoscopic examinations (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.98-1.15) at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study underscored the importance of conducting complete baseline fundoscopic 
      examinations before cataract surgery to clarify whether postoperative conditions 
      are due to patients' underlying diseases or unintended complications of cataract 
      surgery.

TI  - Cannabis use, pain interference, and prescription opioid receipt among persons

AB  - Concomitant with expanded legalization, cannabis is increasingly used to treat 
      chronic pain among persons with HIV (PWH), despite equivocal benefit in research 
      limited by small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. To address these 
      limitations, among a sample of PWH with pain interference enrolled in the 
      Veterans Aging Cohort Study, we performed a target trial emulation study to 
      compare the impact of four cannabis use strategies on pain interference. Among 
      those receiving long-term opioid therapy (LTOT), we also explored impact of these 
      strategies on ≥ 25% LTOT dose reduction. Among the analytic sample (N = 1284), 
      the majority were men with a mean age of 50. Approximately 31% used cannabis and 
      12% received LTOT at baseline. Adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, 
      cannabis use in any of 4 longitudinal patterns was not associated with resolved 
      pain interference over 12- to 24-month follow-up. Among 153 participants 
      receiving LTOT at baseline, cannabis use at both baseline and follow-up was 
      negatively associated with LTOT dose reduction compared to no use at both 
      baseline and follow-up. These findings support other observational studies 
      finding no association between cannabis use and improved chronic pain or LTOT 
      reduction among PWH.

TI  - Antidepressant Use and Risk of Manic Episodes in Children and Adolescents With 
      Unipolar Depression.
PG  - 25-33
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.3555 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Antidepressants are increasingly prescribed to pediatric patients 
      with unipolar depression, but little is known about the risk of 
      treatment-emergent mania. Previous research suggests pediatric patients may be 
      particularly vulnerable to this adverse outcome. OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether 
      pediatric patients treated with antidepressants have an increased incidence of 
      mania/hypomania compared with patients not treated with antidepressants and to 
      identify patient characteristics associated with the risk of mania/hypomania. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a cohort study applying the target trial 
      emulation framework, nationwide inpatient and outpatient care in Sweden from July 
      1, 2006, to December 31, 2019, was evaluated. Follow-up was conducted for 12 and 
      52 weeks after treatment initiation, with administrative follow-up ending 
      December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed between May 1, 2022, and June 28, 2023. 
      Individuals aged 4 to 17 years with a diagnosis of depression, but without a 
      prior diagnosis of mania/hypomania, bipolar disorder, or psychosis or treatment 
      with mood stabilizer (lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine), prescriptions were 
      included. EXPOSURES: The treatment group included patients who initiated any 
      antidepressant medication within 90 days of diagnosis. The control group included 
      patients who did not initiate antidepressants within 90 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Diagnosis of mania/hypomania or initiation of mood stabilizer therapy. 
      Incidences were estimated with Kaplan-Meier estimator, and inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting was used to adjust for group differences at baseline. 
      RESULTS: The cohort included 43 677 patients (28 885 [66%] girls); 24 573 in the 
      treatment group and 19 104 in the control group. The median age was 15 (IQR, 
      14-16) years. The outcome occurred in 96 individuals by 12 weeks and in 291 by 52 
      weeks. The cumulative incidence of mania was 0.26% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.33%) in the 
      treatment group and 0.20% (95% CI, 0.13%-0.27%) in the control group at 12 weeks, 
      with a risk difference of 0.06% (95% CI, -0.04% to 0.16%). At 52 weeks, the 
      cumulative incidence was 0.79% (95% CI, 0.68%-0.91%) in the treatment group and 
      0.52% (95% CI, 0.40%-0.63%) in the control group (risk difference, 0.28%; 95% CI, 
      0.12%-0.44%). Hospitalizations, parental bipolar disorder, and use of 
      antipsychotics and antiepileptics were the most important predictors of 
      mania/hypomania by 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: This cohort study found no evidence of 
      treatment-emergent mania/hypomania by 12 weeks in children and adolescents. This 
      corresponds to the time frame for antidepressants to exert their psychotropic 
      effect. A small risk difference was found only with longer follow-up. Certain 
      patient characteristics were associated with mania/hypomania, which warrants 
      clinical attention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the real-world effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in 
      patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) by replicating a randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT) design in an observational study. METHOD: This study emulated a 
      target trial using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Eligible 
      participants were ≥45 years, had symptomatic KOA and did not take vitamin D 
      supplements in the past 30 days. A participant can enter the trial more than 
      once. Participants were included in vitamin D group if they took ≥1,000 IU/day 
      for ≥4 days/week in the past 30 days at the first follow-up visit after baseline. 
      The control group did not use vitamin D in the past 30 days. Optimal propensity 
      score matching at 1:1 ratio was performed. The primary outcome was change in knee 
      pain 2 years after baseline measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster 
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes included WOMAC 
      physical function and quantitative joint space width (JSW). Standardized mean 
      difference (SMD) was used to compare the findings with previous RCTs. RESULTS: A 
      total of 236 person-trials in the vitamin D group were pair-matched with a 
      control. Compared to the control group, vitamin D supplementation did not reach 
      significant changes in WOMAC pain (SMD = -0.04, 95%CI [-0.21, 0.13]), physical 
      function and radiographic JSW over 2 years. The SMDs were consistent with the 
      effect sizes reported in previous RCTs. CONCLUSION: Target trial emulation in the 
      OAI cohort demonstrated findings close to published RCTs. This supports the 
      future use of target trial emulation in evaluating other systemic therapies for 
      KOA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the leading cause of valvular heart 
      disease-related morbidity and mortality, but there are no medical treatments to 
      slow its progression. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have 
      pleiotropic effects which could be disease modifying in AS. OBJECTIVES: The 
      purpose of this study was to determine if SGLT2i usage is associated with slower 
      progression of AS. METHODS: A target trial emulation comparing the effect of the 
      initiation of SGLT2i compared with no SGLT2i in patients with nonsevere AS was 
      performed using retrospective electronic medical record data from the Yale New 
      Haven Health System from January 2016 to September 2022. Patients with native 
      aortic valve sclerosis or nonsevere AS with at least 12 months of 
      echocardiographic follow-up were included. Patients were excluded if they had an 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or had initiated SGLT2i 
      >1 year before the index echocardiogram. The prespecified primary outcome was 
      progression to severe AS. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients prescribed SGLT2i and 
      11,240 patients never prescribed SGLT2i were included. Patients were on SGLT2i 
      for a median of 0.9 years. Patients on SGLT2i were younger and had higher rates 
      of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Patients on SGLT2i were more likely to 
      have ejection fraction ≤40%. There were no differences between groups in baseline 
      AS severity (66% sclerosis, 23% mild stenosis, and 11% moderate in overall 
      cohort). Patients ever prescribed SGLT2i were less likely to progress to severe 
      AS (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.39-0.94; P = 0.03) with a progressively lower risk among 
      patients on SGLT2i for >3, 6, and 12 months (HR: 0.54, 0.48, and 0.27, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective, multicenter, observational study 
      suggests that SGLT2i may slow the progression of nonsevere AS.

TI  - Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) effectiveness against hospitalization and death 
      in N3C: A target trial emulation study.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 has placed a monumental burden on the health care system 
      globally. Although no longer a public health emergency, there is still a pressing 
      need for effective treatments to prevent hospitalization and death. Paxlovid 
      (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) is a promising and potentially effective antiviral that 
      has received emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA. OBJECTIVE: Determine 
      real world effectiveness of Paxlovid nationwide and investigate disparities 
      between treated and untreated eligible patients. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: 
      Population-based cohort study emulating a target trial, using inverse probability 
      weighted models to balance treated and untreated groups on baseline confounders. 
      Participants were patients with a SARS-CoV-2 positive test or diagnosis (index) 
      date between December 2021 and February 2023 selected from the National COVID 
      Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database who were eligible for Paxlovid treatment. 
      Namely, adults with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness, no 
      contraindicated medical conditions, not using one or more strictly 
      contraindicated medications, and not hospitalized within three days of index. 
      From this cohort we identified patients who were treated with Paxlovid within 5 
      days of positive test or diagnosis (n = 98,060) and patients who either did not 
      receive Paxlovid or were treated outside the 5-day window (n = 913,079 never 
      treated; n = 1,771 treated after 5 days). EXPOSURES: Treatment with Paxlovid 
      within 5 days of positive COVID-19 test or diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Hospitalization and death in the 28 days following COVID-19 index date. RESULTS: 
      A total of 1,012,910 COVID-19 positive patients at risk for severe COVID-19 were 
      included, 9.7% of whom were treated with Paxlovid. Uptake varied widely by 
      geographic region and timing, with top adoption areas near 50% and bottom near 
      0%. Adoption increased rapidly after EUA, reaching steady state by 6/2022. 
      Participants who were treated with Paxlovid had a 26% (RR, 0.742; 95% CI, 
      0.689-0.812) reduction in hospitalization risk and 73% (RR, 0.269, 95% CI, 
      0.179-0.370) reduction in mortality risk in the 28 days following COVID-19 index 
      date. CONCLUSIONS/RELEVANCE: Paxlovid is effective in preventing hospitalization 
      and death in at-risk COVID-19 patients. These results were robust to a large 
      number of sensitivity considerations. DISCLOSURE: The authors report no 
      disclosures. KEY POINTS: Question: Is treatment with Paxlovid 
      (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) associated with a reduction in 28-day hospitalization 
      and mortality in patients at risk for severe COVID-19? Findings: In this 
      multi-institute retrospective cohort study of 1,012,910 patients, Paxlovid 
      treatment within 5 days after COVID-19 diagnosis reduced 28-day hospitalization 
      and mortality by 26% and 73% respectively, compared to no treatment with Paxlovid 
      within 5 days. Paxlovid uptake was low overall (9.7%) and highly variable. 
      Meaning: In Paxlovid-eligible patients, treatment was associated with decreased 
      risk of hospitalization and death. Results align with prior randomized trials and 
      observational studies, thus supporting the real-world effectiveness of Paxlovid.

TI  - Effectiveness of Molnupiravir and Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir in Hospitalized Patients 
      With COVID-19 : A Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 505-514
LID - 10.7326/M22-3057 [doi]
LID - M22-3057
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether hospitalized patients benefit from COVID-19 oral antivirals 
      is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the real-world effectiveness of molnupiravir 
      and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the 
      Omicron outbreak. DESIGN: Target trial emulation study. SETTING: Electronic 
      health databases in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: The molnupiravir emulated trial 
      included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or older between 26 
      February and 18 July 2022 (n = 16 495). The nirmatrelvir-ritonavir emulated trial 
      included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or older between 16 
      March and 18 July 2022 (n = 7119). INTERVENTION: Initiation of molnupiravir or 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of hospitalization with COVID-19 versus no 
      initiation of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. MEASUREMENTS: Effectiveness 
      against all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or use of 
      ventilatory support within 28 days. RESULTS: The use of oral antivirals in 
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was associated with a lower risk for 
      all-cause mortality (molnupiravir: hazard ratio [HR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81 to 
      0.93]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 0.77 [CI, 0.66 to 0.90]) but no significant 
      risk reduction in terms of ICU admission (molnupiravir: HR, 1.02 [CI, 0.76 to 
      1.36]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 1.08 [CI, 0.58 to 2.02]) or the need for 
      ventilatory support (molnupiravir: HR, 1.07 [CI, 0.89 to 1.30]; 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 1.03 [CI, 0.70 to 1.52]). There was no significant 
      interaction between drug treatment and the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses 
      received, thereby supporting the effectiveness of oral antivirals regardless of 
      vaccination status. No significant interaction between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 
      treatment and age, sex, or Charlson Comorbidity Index was observed, whereas 
      molnupiravir tended to be more effective in older people. LIMITATION: The outcome 
      of ICU admission or need for ventilatory support may not capture all severe 
      COVID-19 cases; unmeasured confounders, such as obesity and health behaviors, may 
      exist. CONCLUSION: Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced all-cause 
      mortality in both vaccinated and unvaccinated hospitalized patients. No 
      significant reduction in ICU admission or the need for ventilatory support was 
      observed. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Health and Medical Research Fund Research on

TI  - Inhaled Nitric Oxide vs Epoprostenol During Acute Respiratory Failure: An 
      Observational Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 1287-1296

AB  - BACKGROUND: The inhaled vasodilators nitric oxide and epoprostenol may be 
      initiated to improve oxygenation in mechanically ventilated patients with severe 
      acute respiratory failure (ARF); however, practice patterns and head-to-head 
      comparisons of effectiveness are unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the 
      practice patterns and comparative effectiveness for inhaled nitric oxide and 
      epoprostenol in severe ARF? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a large US database 
      (Premier Healthcare Database), we identified adult patients with ARF or ARDS who 
      were mechanically ventilated and started on inhaled nitric oxide, epoprostenol, 
      or both. Leveraging large hospital variation in the choice of initial inhaled 
      vasodilator, we compared the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide with that of 
      epoprostenol by limiting analysis to patients admitted to hospitals that 
      exclusively used either inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol. The primary outcome 
      of successful extubation was modeled using multivariate Fine-Grey competing risk 
      (death or hospice discharge) time-to-event models. RESULTS: Among 11,200 patients 
      (303 hospitals), 6,366 patients (56.8%) received inhaled nitric oxide first, 
      4,720 patients (42.1%) received inhaled epoprostenol first, and 114 patients 
      (1.0%) received both therapies on the same day. One hundred four hospitals 
      (34.3%; 1,666 patients) exclusively used nitric oxide and 118 hospitals (38.9%; 
      1,812 patients) exclusively used epoprostenol. No differences were found in the 
      likelihood of successful extubation between patients admitted to nitric 
      oxide-only hospitals vs those admitted to epoprostenol-only hospitals 
      (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80-1.18). Also no differences were 
      found in total hospital costs or death. Results were robust to multiple 
      sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Large variation exists in the use of 
      initial inhaled vasodilator for respiratory failure across US hospitals. 
      Comparative effectiveness analyses identified no differences in outcomes based on 
      inhaled vasodilator type.

TI  - Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors vs GLP-1 RAs and Anemia in Patients With Diabetes and 
      CKD.
PG  - e240946
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0946 [doi]
LID - e240946
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are associated with 
      lower anemia risk, based on findings from post hoc analyses of the CREDENCE and 
      DAPA-CKD trials; however, the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in a more 
      generalizable type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, 
      with active comparisons pertinent to current practice, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate and compare anemia incidence between SGLT2 inhibitors and glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) among patients with T2D and CKD stages 1 
      to 3. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used 
      target trial emulation of an expanded CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD study framework. The 
      study was conducted among adults with T2D and CKD initiating SGLT2 inhibitors or 
      GLP-1 RAs between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021, with follow-up until 
      December 31, 2022. The study was conducted at the Chang Gung Medical Foundation, 
      the largest multi-institutional hospital system in Taiwan. EXPOSURES: Initiation 
      of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome 
      was a composite of anemia outcomes, including anemia event occurrence (hemoglobin 
      level <12-13 g/dL or International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth 
      Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes) or anemia treatment initiation. 
      Changes in hematological parameters, including hemoglobin level, hematocrit 
      level, and red blood cell count, were evaluated during the follow-up period for 
      as long as 3 years. RESULTS: The cohort included a total of 13 799 patients with 
      T2D and CKD, initiating SGLT2 inhibitors (12 331 patients; mean [SD] age, 62.4 
      [12.3] years; 7548 [61.2%] male) or GLP-1 RAs (1468 patients; mean [SD] age, 61.5 
      [13.3] years; 900 [61.3%] male). After the median follow-up period of 2.5 years, 
      patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors had lower incidence of composite anemia 
      outcomes (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.90) compared with those 
      receiving GLP-1 RAs. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower incidence of 
      anemia events (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71-0.87) but not with a lower rate of anemia 
      treatment initiation (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83-1.19). Changes in hematological 
      parameters for SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs throughout the 3-year follow-up 
      period supported the primary analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 
      multi-institutional cohort study with target trial emulation, SGLT2 inhibitors 
      were associated with a decreased risk of composite anemia outcomes, especially 
      anemia event occurrences. SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered as an adjunct 
      therapy to reduce anemia incidence in patients with T2D and CKD.

TI  - Clinical and Adverse Outcomes Associated With Concomitant Use of 
      CYP2D6-Metabolized Opioids With Antidepressants in Older Nursing Home Residents : 
      A Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 1058-1068
LID - 10.7326/M23-3109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited evidence exists on the safety of pharmacokinetic interactions 
      of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 (CYP2D6)-metabolized opioids with antidepressants 
      among older nursing home (NH) residents. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      associations of concomitant use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids and antidepressants 
      with clinical outcomes and opioid-related adverse events (ORAEs). DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study using a target trial emulation framework. SETTING: 
      100% Medicare NH sample linked to Minimum Data Set (MDS) from 2010 to 2021. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Long-term residents aged 65 years and older receiving 
      CYP2D6-metabolized opioids with a disease indication for antidepressant use. 
      INTERVENTION: Initiating CYP2D6-inhibiting versus CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants 
      that overlapped with use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids for 1 day or more. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Clinical outcomes were worsening pain, physical function, and 
      depression from baseline to quarterly MDS assessments and were analyzed using 
      modified Poisson regression models. The ORAE outcomes included counts of 
      pain-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, opioid use 
      disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose and were analyzed with negative binomial or 
      Poisson regression models. All models were adjusted for baseline covariates via 
      inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among 29 435 identified 
      residents, use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids concomitantly with CYP2D6-inhibiting 
      (vs. CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with a higher adjusted rate 
      ratio of worsening pain (1.13 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.17]) and higher adjusted 
      incidence rate ratios of pain-related hospitalization (1.37 [CI, 1.19 to 1.59]), 
      pain-related ED visit (1.49 [CI, 1.24 to 1.80]), and OUD (1.93 [CI, 1.37 to 
      2.73]), with no difference in physical function, depression, and opioid overdose. 
      LIMITATION: Findings are generalizable to NH populations only. CONCLUSION: Use of 
      CYP2D6-metabolized opioids concomitantly with CYP2D6-inhibiting (vs. 
      CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with worsening pain and increased 
      risk for most assessed ORAEs among older NH residents. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE:

TI  - Effectiveness and Safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants Versus Warfarin in 
      Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Cancer: A Target Trial Emulation from 
      SEER-Medicare Database.
LID - 10.1007/s10557-024-07589-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). However, their safety and effectiveness 
      in patients with AFib and cancer are inconclusive. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective cohort study by emulating a target trial. Patients with a record of 
      cancer (breast, prostate, or lung), newly diagnosed with AFib initiated DOACs or 
      warfarin within 3 months after AFib diagnosis from the 2012-2019 Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database were included. We compared 
      the risk of ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and secondary outcomes (venous 
      thromboembolism, intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
      non-critical site bleeding) between patients who initiated DOACs and warfarin. 
      Inverse probability treatment weights and inverse probability censoring weights 
      were used to adjust imbalanced patient and disease characteristics and loss to 
      follow-up between the two groups. Weighted pooled logistic regression were used 
      to estimate treatment effect with hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence 
      interval (95% CIs). RESULTS: The incidence rates of stroke and major bleeding 
      between DOAC and warfarin initiators were 9.97 vs. 9.91 and 7.74 vs. 9.24 cases 
      per 1000 person-years, respectively. In adjusted intention-to-treat analysis, 
      patients initiated DOACs had no statistically significant difference in risk of 
      ischemic stroke (HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.52-1.44) and major bleeding (HR = 1.14, 95% 
      CI 0.77-1.68) compared to those initiated warfarin. In adjusted per-protocol 
      analysis, there was no statistical difference in risk of ischemic stroke 
      (HR = 1.81, 95% CI 0.75-4.36) and lower risk for major bleeding, but the 95% CI 
      was wide (HR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.12-0.99) among DOAC initiators compared to warfarin 
      initiators. The benefits in secondary outcomes were in favor of DOACs. The 
      findings remained consistent across subgroups and sensitivity analyses. 
      CONCLUSION: DOACs are safe and effective alternatives to warfarin in the 
      management of patients with AFib and cancer.

TI  - Association of low-dose ketamine with hallucinations in critically ill patients: 
      a target trial emulation.
PG  - 1011-1021
LID - 10.1007/s00134-025-07926-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ketamine use is a potentially modifiable risk factor for hallucinations. 
      We aimed to use target trial emulation to investigate the association between 
      low-dose ketamine and development of hallucinations in critically ill patients in 
      the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Retrospective study using data from a 
      university affiliated ICU in Melbourne, Australia. Application of marginal 
      structural models and parametric g-formulas to assess the impact of low-dose 
      ketamine on the development of hallucinations. RESULTS: We studied 7514 patients 
      from June 2016 to April 2021. Of these, 625 patients (8%) received low-dose 
      ketamine, beginning at a median of 0 (0-1) days from ICU admission and at a mean 
      daily dose of 0.11 (0.08-0.15) mg/kg/h. Low-dose ketamine treated patients had a 
      higher rate of hallucinations within 30 days of ICU admission (26% vs. 7%; 
      p < 0.001) and the first episode of hallucination occurred earlier than in 
      unexposed patient (2 [1-3] vs. 3 [1-7] days from ICU admission; p < 0.001). After 
      adjustment for baseline and time-dependent confounders, low-dose ketamine was 
      associated with a higher risk of hallucinations within 30 days (OR, 6.46 [95% CI 
      5.17-8.07]; p < 0.001). These findings were confirmed with parametric g-formulas. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In ICU patients, low-dose ketamine was strongly associated with an 
      increased risk of hallucinations. However, these findings should be interpreted 
      with caution due to the observational nature of the study and the risk of 
      residual confounding.

TI  - Cefazolin vs. alternative beta-lactams for prophylaxis in lower extremity 
      fracture surgery: A target trial emulation.
PG  - 112215
LID - S0020-1383(25)00075-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.injury.2025.112215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefazolin is the primary antibiotic for surgical prophylaxis in 
      orthopedic procedures. The cessation of cefazolin supply in approximately 60 % of 
      Japanese hospitals from 2019 to 2020 provided an opportunity to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of alternative beta-lactams for preventing surgical site infection 
      (SSI). Given the global potential for antibiotics shortages, confirming the 
      effectiveness of alternative beta-lactams is critical. PURPOSE: This study aims 
      to evaluate the differences in risk of reoperation for SSI between cefazolin and 
      alternative beta-lactams in patients undergoing lower extremity fracture 
      surgeries. METHODS: We emulated a target trial to compare the effectiveness of 
      cefazolin with alternative beta-lactams-specifically broad-spectrum penicillins 
      and cephalosporins-in preventing SSI using a Japanese hospital administrative 
      database provided by JMDC Inc. We included patients undergoing initial open 
      reduction and internal fixation for closed lower extremity fractures between 
      March 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020. The outcome was reoperation for SSI within 
      30 days after surgery. Risks were estimated using pooled logistic regression with 
      adjustment for confounders via inverse probability weighting. Sensitivity 
      analyses extended the follow-up period to 90 and 365 days. RESULTS: Of the 16,602 
      patients analyzed, 35 patients (0.30 %) in the cefazolin group (11,538 patients) 
      and 16 patients (0.32 %) in the alternative beta-lactam group (5,064 patients) 
      underwent reoperation for SSI within 30 days. The estimated 30-day risk was 0.31 
      % in the cefazolin group and 0.37 % in the alternative beta-lactam group, 
      resulting in a risk difference of -0.06 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], -0.33 
      to 0.14) and a risk ratio of 0.82 (95 % CI, 0.50 to 1.52). In sensitivity 
      analyses, the estimated 90-day risk was 0.67 % in the cefazolin group and 0.57 % 
      in the alternative beta-lactam group, with a risk difference of 0.10 % (95 % CI, 
      -0.15 to 0.32) and a risk ratio of 1.19 (95 % CI, 0.80 to 1.62). The 365-day risk 
      was 1.02 % and 0.90 %, respectively, with a risk difference of 0.12 % (95 % CI, 
      -0.29 to 0.39) and a risk ratio of 1.13 (95 % CI, 0.78 to 1.51). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      surgeries for lower extremity fractures, substituting cefazolin with alternative 
      beta-lactams did not result in substantial differences in the risk of reoperation 
      for SSI.

TI  - Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and police-reported motor vehicle crash risk among 
      older adults: a sequential target trial emulation.
PG  - 662-673
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae168 [doi]
AB  - Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics ("Z-drugs") are prescribed for insomnia but might 
      increase the risk of motor vehicle crash (MVC) among older adults through 
      prolonged drowsiness and delayed reaction times. We estimated the effect of 
      initiating Z-drug treatment on the 12-week risk of MVC in a sequential target 
      trial emulation. After linking New Jersey driver licensing and police-reported 
      MVC data to Medicare claims, we emulated a new target trial each week (July 1, 
      2007, to October 7, 2017) in which Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries were 
      classified as Z-drug-treated or untreated at baseline and followed for an MVC. We 
      used inverse probability of treatment and censoring-weighted pooled logistic 
      regression models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences with 95% 
      bootstrap confidence limits (CLs). There were 257 554 person-trials, of which 
      103 371 were Z-drug-treated and 154 183 untreated, giving rise to 976 and 1249 
      MVCs, respectively. The intention-to-treat RR was 1.06 (95% CL, 0.95-1.16). For 
      the per-protocol estimand, there were 800 MVCs and 1241 MVCs among treated and 
      untreated person-trials, respectively, suggesting a reduced MVC risk (RR, 0.83; 
      95% CL, 0.74-0.92) with sustained Z-drug treatment. Z-drugs should be prescribed 
      to older patients judiciously but not withheld entirely over concerns about MVC 
      risk. This article is part of a Special Collection on Pharmacoepidemiology.

TI  - Comparing PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibody Treatment Strategies Following Myocardial 
      Infarction Using Negative Control Outcomes: A Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 579-588
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Initiation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 
      monoclonal antibody (PCSK9 mAb) for lipid-lowering following myocardial 
      infarction (MI) is likely affected by patients' prognostic factors, potentially 
      leading to bias when comparing real-world treatment effects. METHODS: Using 
      target-trial emulation, we assessed potential confounding when comparing two 
      treatment strategies post-MI: initiation of PCSK9 mAb within 1 year and no 
      initiation of PCSK9 mAb. We identified MI hospitalizations during July 2015-June 
      2020 for patients aged ≥18 years in Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart 
      (CDM) and MarketScan, and those aged ≥66 in the US Medicare claims database. We 
      estimated a 3-year counterfactual cumulative risk and risk difference (RD) for 10 
      negative control outcomes using the clone-censor-weight approach to address 
      time-varying confounding and immortal person-time. RESULTS: PCSK9 mAb initiation 
      within 1-year post-MI was low (0.7% in MarketScan and 0.4% in both CDM and 
      Medicare databases). In CDM, there was a lower risk for cancer (RD = -3.6% [95% 
      CI: -4.3%, -2.9%]), decubitus ulcer (RD = -7.7% [95% CI: -11.8%, -3.7%]), 
      fracture (RD = -8.1% [95% CI: -9.6%, -6.6%]), influenza vaccine (RD = -9.3% [95% 
      CI: -17.5%, -1.1%]), and visual test (RD = -0.6% [95% CI: -0.7%, -0.6%]) under 
      the PCSK9 mAb initiation versus no initiation strategy. Similar differences 
      persisted in the MarketScan and Medicare databases. In each database, ezetimibe 
      and low-density lipoprotein testing were unbalanced between treatment strategies. 
      CONCLUSION: A comparative effectiveness study of these treatments using the 
      current approach would likely bias results due to the low number of PCSK9 mAb 
      initiators.

TI  - Clinical outcomes following discontinuation of metformin in patients with type 2 
      diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease in Hong Kong: a territory-wide, 
      retrospective cohort and target trial emulation study.
PG  - 102568
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102568 [doi]
LID - 102568
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current labelling advises discontinuation of metformin when estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) due to increased risk of 
      lactic acidosis. However, in real-world practice, the risk-benefit ratios remain 
      uncertain. We examined the risk associations of discontinued-metformin use with 
      cardiorenal and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 
      advanced chronic kidney disease. METHODS: In this territory-wide, retrospective 
      cohort and target trial emulation study, we included Chinese patients attending 
      the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA) and enrolled in the 
      Risk-Assessment-and-Management-Programme-for-Diabetes-Mellitus (RAMP-DM) from 
      2002 to 2019. Patients were stratified by discontinuation of metformin within six 
      months after reaching eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) from January 1, 2002 to December 
      31, 2018, and followed up until December 31 2019. We excluded patients who had 
      observational time <6 months from eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and had their eGFR 
      measured during a hospitalisation episode due to acute kidney injury, or missing 
      diagnosis date of diabetes. We compared the risk associations of metformin 
      discontinuation with clinical outcomes. The primary outcomes were major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (MACE), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), cancer, and 
      all-cause mortality. A Cox-model with time-dependent exposure and covariates was 
      used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of outcomes in a propensity-score 
      overlap-weighted cohort. The risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis (serum lactate 
      > 5.0 mmol/L with a concomitant blood pH < 7.35 or ICD-9 codes of 276.2) in 
      discontinued-metformin versus continued-metformin users was assessed in a 
      separate register-based cohort. FINDINGS: A total of 33,586 metformin users with 
      new-onset eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) were included in the study, 7500 (22.3%) of 
      whom discontinued metformin within 6 months whereas 26,086 (77.7%) continued use 
      of metformin. During a median follow-up of 3.8 (IQR: 2.2-6.1) years, 16.4% 
      (5505/33,586), 30.1% (10,113/33,586), and 7.1% (2171/30,682) had incident MACE, 
      ESKD, and cancer respectively, and 44.4% (14,917/33,586) died. Compared to 
      continued-metformin use, discontinuation was associated with higher risk of MACE 
      (weighted and adjusted HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.29-1.52), ESKD (HR = 1.52, 
      1.42-1.62), and death (HR = 1.22, 1.18-1.27). No association was observed for 
      cancer (HR = 0.93, 0.85-1.01). Discontinued-metformin users had higher change in 
      HbA1c change at 6-month of follow-up versus continued-metformin users (weighted 
      mean HbA1c level change: 0.5% [0.4-0.6%] versus 0.2% [0.1-0.2]). In the separate 
      register-based cohort (n = 3235), null association was observed between metformin 
      use and risk of lactic acidosis (weighted HR = 0.94 [0.53-1.64]). INTERPRETATION: 
      Our results suggest that discontinuation of metformin in patients with T2D and 
      chronic kidney disease may be associated with increased risk of 
      cardiovascular-renal events. Use of metformin below eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) 
      may be associated with cardiovascular, renal, and mortality benefits that need to 
      be weighed against the risk of lactic acidosis, but further research is needed to 
      validate these findings. FUNDING: CUHK Impact Research Fellowship Scheme.

      versus gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GN) within 8 weeks of diagnosis on 
      overall survival. METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted using 
      population-level data from Alberta, Canada. Individuals diagnosed with advanced 
      pancreatic cancer between April 2015 and December 2019 were identified through 
      the provincial cancer registry and followed until March 2021. Records were linked 
      to other administrative databases containing information on relevant variables. 
      Individuals were excluded if they did not have adequate hemoglobin, platelet, 
      white blood cell, and serum creatinine measures or if they received prior 
      therapy. The observational analog of the per-protocol effect was estimated using 
      inverse probability weighted Kaplan-Meier curves with bootstrapped 95% confidence 
      intervals. RESULTS: Four hundred seven individuals were eligible. The weighted 
      median overall survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.7-11.9) for FOLFIRINOX and 5.1 
      months (95% CI: 4.3 to 5.8) for GN. The adjusted difference in median overall 
      survival was 3.2 months (95% CI, 1.1-7.4) and the mortality hazard ratio was 0.78 
      (95% CI, 0.61-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates favored the initiation of 
      FOLFIRINOX over GN with respect to overall survival.

PG  - 52-60

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Asymptomatic blood pressure (BP) elevations in the hospital are 
      commonly treated with as-needed BP medications, including recurring as-needed and 
      1-time administration. Veterans represent a population at risk of ischemic events 
      from rapid lowering of BP, but the impact of as-needed BP medication use in this 
      population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks of acute kidney injury 
      (AKI) and other outcomes from as-needed BP medication administration in a 
      hospitalized veteran cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation and propensity score 
      matching included adult veterans, who were hospitalized 3 or more days in 
      Veterans Administration hospitals between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 
      2020. Participants must have been hospitalized on a non-intensive care unit 
      medical or surgical floor, must not have undergone surgery, and must have 
      received at least 1 scheduled BP medication in the first 24 hours of admission. 
      Participants also must have had at least 1 systolic BP more than 140 mm Hg during 
      hospitalization. Data in this study were analyzed from April 2023 to August 2024. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to first AKI occurrence 
      during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included greater than 25% reduction in 
      systolic BP within 3 hours of as-needed BP medication administration and the 
      composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death during 
      hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 133 760 veterans eligible for analysis (mean 
      [SD] age, 71.2 [11.6] years), 96% were male. The mean (SD) baseline estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate was 75.7 (22.7) mL/min/1.73m2. A total of 28 526 
      patients (21%) received as-needed BP medication. As-needed BP medication use was 
      associated with an increased AKI risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23 [95% CI, 
      1.18-1.29]) compared to nonusers. Subgroup analyses showed higher AKI risk with 
      intravenous as-needed BP medication use (compared to oral or combined oral and 
      intravenous routes). Secondary analyses indicated as-needed BP medication users 
      had a 1.5-fold greater risk of rapid BP reduction (95% CI, 1.39-1.62) and 
      1.69-fold higher rate of the composite outcome (95% CI, 1.49-1.92) compared to 
      nonusers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this retrospective cohort 
      study showed that as-needed BP medication use among veterans is associated with 
      increased AKI risk. The risks and benefits of this type of BP medication use 
      would best be determined through a prospective trial, and these data suggest that 
      there is the necessary equipoise to conduct such a trial.

TI  - Effect of erythromycin on mortality and the host response in critically ill 
      patients with sepsis: a target trial emulation.
PG  - 151
LID - 10.1186/s13054-022-04016-x [doi]
LID - 151
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunomodulatory therapies that improve the outcome of sepsis are not 
      available. We sought to determine whether treatment of critically ill patients 
      with sepsis with low-dose erythromycin-a macrolide antibiotic with broad 
      immunomodulatory effects-decreased mortality and ameliorated underlying disease 
      pathophysiology. METHODS: We conducted a target trial emulation, comparing 
      patients with sepsis admitted to two intensive care units (ICU) in the 
      Netherlands for at least 72 h, who were either exposed or not exposed during this 
      period to treatment with low-dose erythromycin (up to 600 mg per day, 
      administered as a prokinetic agent) but no other macrolides. We used two common 
      propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment 
      weighting) to deal with confounding by indication and subsequently used Cox 
      regression models to estimate the treatment effect on the primary outcome of 
      mortality rate up to day 90. Secondary clinical outcomes included change in SOFA, 
      duration of mechanical ventilation and the incidence of ICU-acquired infections. 
      We used linear mixed models to assess differences in 15 host response biomarkers 
      reflective of key pathophysiological processes from admission to day 4. RESULTS: 
      In total, 235 patients started low-dose erythromycin treatment, 470 patients 
      served as controls. Treatment started at a median of 38 [IQR 25-52] hours after 
      ICU admission for a median of 5 [IQR 3-8] total doses in the first course. 
      Matching and weighting resulted in populations well balanced for proposed 
      confounders. We found no differences between patients treated with low-dose 
      erythromycin and control subjects in mortality rate up to day 90: matching HR 
      0.89 (95% CI 0.64-1.24), weighting HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.66-1.36). There were no 
      differences in secondary clinical outcomes. The change in host response biomarker 
      levels from admission to day 4 was similar between erythromycin-treated and 
      control subjects. CONCLUSION: In this target trial emulation in critically ill 
      patients with sepsis, we could not demonstrate an effect of treatment with 
      low-dose erythromycin on mortality, secondary clinical outcomes or host response 
      biomarkers.

TI  - Introduction to target trial emulation in rehabilitation: a systematic approach 
      to emulate a randomized controlled trial using observational data.
PG  - 145-153

AB  - Rehabilitation providers and policymakers need valid evidence to make informed 
      decisions about the healthcare needs of the population. Whenever possible, these 
      decisions should be informed by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, 
      there are circumstances when evidence needs to be generated rapidly, or when RCTs 
      are not ethical or feasible. These situations apply to studying the effects of 
      complex interventions, including rehabilitation as defined by Cochrane 
      Rehabilitation. Therefore, we explore using the target trial emulation framework 
      by Hernán and colleagues to obtain valid estimates of the causal effects of 
      rehabilitation when RCTs cannot be conducted. Target trial emulation is a 
      framework guiding the design and analysis of non-randomized comparative 
      effectiveness studies using observational data, by emulating a hypothetical RCT. 
      In the context of rehabilitation, we outline steps for applying the target trial 
      emulation framework using real world data, highlighting methodological 
      considerations, limitations, potential mitigating strategies, and causal 
      inference and counterfactual theory as foundational principles to estimating 
      causal effects. Overall, we aim to strengthen methodological approaches used to 
      estimate causal effects of rehabilitation when RCTs cannot be conducted.

TI  - De-Mystifying the Clone-Censor-Weight Method for Causal Research Using 
      Observational Data: A Primer for Cancer Researchers.
PG  - e70461
LID - 10.1002/cam4.70461 [doi]
LID - e70461
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regulators and oncology healthcare providers are increasingly 
      interested in using observational studies of real-world data (RWD) to complement 
      clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials for informed decision-making. 
      To generate valid evidence, RWD studies must be carefully designed to avoid 
      systematic biases. The clone-censor-weight (CCW) method has been proposed to 
      address immortal time and other time-related biases. METHODS: The objective of 
      this manuscript is to de-mystify the CCW method for cancer researchers by 
      describing and presenting its core components in an accessible and digestible 
      format, using visualizations and examples from cancer-relevant studies. The CCW 
      method has been applied in diverse settings, including investigations of the 
      effects of surgery within a certain time after cancer diagnosis, the continuation 
      of annual screening mammography, and chemotherapy duration on survival. RESULTS: 
      The method handles complex data wherein the treatment group to which an 
      individual belongs is unknown at the start of follow-up. The three steps of the 
      CCW method involve cloning or duplicating the patient population and assigning 
      one clone to each treatment strategy, artificially censoring the clones when 
      their observed data are inconsistent with the assigned strategy and weighting the 
      cloned and censored population to address selection bias created by the 
      artificial censoring. CONCLUSIONS: The CCW method is a powerful tool for 
      designing RWD studies in cancer that are free from time-related biases and 
      successfully, to the extent possible, emulate features of a randomized clinical 
      trial.

TI  - Effectiveness of Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir Against the Development of Post-COVID-19 
      Conditions Among U.S. Veterans : A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 1486-1497
LID - 10.7326/M23-1394 [doi]
LID - M23-1394
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been linked to the development of many post-COVID-19 
      conditions (PCCs) after acute infection. Limited information is available on the 
      effectiveness of oral antivirals used to treat acute COVID-19 in preventing the 
      development of PCCs. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effectiveness of outpatient 
      treatment of COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in preventing PCCs. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective target trial emulation study comparing matched cohorts receiving 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no treatment. SETTING: Veterans Health 
      Administration (VHA). PARTICIPANTS: Nonhospitalized veterans in VHA care who were 
      at risk for severe COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during January 
      through July 2022. INTERVENTION: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute 
      COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Cumulative incidence of 31 potential PCCs at 31 to 180 
      days after treatment or a matched index date, including cardiac, pulmonary, 
      renal, thromboembolic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, mental health, 
      musculoskeletal, endocrine, and general conditions and symptoms. RESULTS: 
      Eighty-six percent of the participants were male, with a median age of 66 years, 
      and 17.5% were unvaccinated. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between 
      participants treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and matched untreated 
      comparators. No differences were observed between participants treated with 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 9593) and their matched untreated comparators in the 
      incidence of most PCCs examined individually or grouped by organ system, except 
      for lower combined risk for venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism 
      (subhazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.97]; cumulative incidence difference, 
      -0.29 percentage points [CI, -0.52 to -0.05 percentage points]). LIMITATIONS: 
      Ascertainment of PCCs using International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
      Revision, codes may be inaccurate. Evaluation of many outcomes could have 
      resulted in spurious associations with combined thromboembolic events by chance. 
      CONCLUSION: Out of 31 potential PCCs, only combined thromboembolic events seemed 
      to be reduced by nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: U.S. Department 
      of Veterans Affairs.

      approach to compare arteriovenous fistula (AVF) versus arteriovenous graft (AVG) 
      creation among elderly patients receiving HD. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort 
      study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Elderly patients included in the US Renal Data 
      System who initiated HD with a catheter and had an AVF or AVG created within 6 
      months of starting HD. EXPOSURE: Creation of an AVF versus an AVG as the incident 
      arteriovenous access. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality, all-cause and cause-specific 
      hospitalization, and sepsis. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Target trial emulation 
      approach, high-dimensional propensity score and inverse probability of treatment 
      weighting, and instrumental variable analysis using the proclivity of the 
      operating physician to create a fistula as the instrumental variable. RESULTS: A 
      total of 19,867 patients were included, with 80.1% receiving an AVF and 19.9% an 
      AVG. In unweighted analysis, AVF creation was associated with significantly lower 
      risks of mortality and hospitalization, especially within 6 months after vascular 
      access creation. In inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis, AVF 
      creation was associated with lower incidences of mortality and hospitalization 
      within 6 months after creation (hazard ratios of 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75-0.91] and 
      0.82 [95% CI, 0.78-0.87] for mortality and all-cause hospitalization, 
      respectively), but not between 6 months and 3 years after access creation. No 
      association between AVF creation and mortality, sepsis, or all-cause, 
      cardiovascular disease-related, or infection-related hospitalization was found in 
      instrumental variable analyses. However, AVF creation was associated with a lower 
      risk of access-related hospitalization not due to infection. LIMITATIONS: 
      Potential for unmeasured confounding, analyses limited to elderly patients, and 
      absence of data on actual access use during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Using 
      observational data to emulate a target randomized controlled trial, the type of 
      initial arteriovenous access created was not associated with the risks of 
      mortality, sepsis, or all-cause, cardiovascular disease-related, or 
      infection-related hospitalization among elderly patients who initiated HD with a 
      catheter.

TI  - Chitosan combined with intrauterine device prevents intrauterine adhesions after 
      hysteroscopic adhesiolysis: A target trial emulation study.
PG  - 1571-1578
LID - 10.1111/jog.15629 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of chitosan and intrauterine device (IUD) 
      combination with an IUD alone in patients with intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) who 
      underwent hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 
      303 patients with moderate-to-severe IUA (American Fertility Society [AFS] score 
      ≥5) who underwent hysteroscopic adhesiolysis between January 2018 and December 
      2020. Using observational data under a cohort design, we emulated a target trial 
      with two treatment arms: chitosan plus IUD and IUD alone groups. Second-look 
      hysteroscopy was performed in all patients 3 months after the initial 
      hysteroscopy. The primary outcome was improved adhesion assessed using the AFS 
      scoring system. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were balanced between the 
      two groups. The second hysteroscopy revealed significantly better AFS scores in 
      group A than in group B (values: 3 [1-4] vs. 4 [2-6], p < 0.001; change: 63% 
      [50%-80%] vs. 44% [33%-67%], p < 0.001, respectively). Significantly better 
      menstruation conditions (improved rate: 66% vs. 49%, p = 0.004) and endometrial 
      thickness (mean: 7.0 mm vs. 6.0 mm, p < 0.001) were also observed in group A than 
      in group B. Moreover, group A showed a significantly higher 1-year clinical 
      pregnancy rate (40% vs. 28%, p = 0.037) and better quality of life (p < 0.001) 
      than group B. CONCLUSIONS: Chitosan and IUD combination showed better efficacy in 
      reducing adhesions and improving clinical outcomes in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe IUA after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis.

TI  - Antipsychotic therapy and suicide risk in patients with treatment-resistant 
      depression: target trial emulation framework study.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1192/bjp.2024.283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies investigating the effectiveness of augmentation 
      therapy have been limited. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of antipsychotic 
      augmentation therapies among patients with treatment-resistant depression. 
      METHOD: We included patients diagnosed with depression receiving two 
      antidepressant courses within 1 year between 2009 and 2020 and used the 
      clone-censor-weight approach to address time-lag bias. Participants were assigned 
      to either an antipsychotic or a third-line antidepressant. Primary outcomes were 
      suicide attempt and suicide death. Cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality 
      were considered as safety outcomes. Weighted pooled logistic regression and 
      non-parametric bootstrapping were used to estimate approximate hazard ratios and 
      95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The cohort included 39 949 patients receiving 
      antipsychotics and the same number of matched antidepressant patients. The mean 
      age was 51.2 (standard deviation 16.0) years, and 37.3% of participants were 
      male. Compared with patients who received third-line antidepressants, those 
      receiving antipsychotics had reduced risk of suicide attempt (sub-distribution 
      hazard ratio 0.77; 95% CI 0.72-0.83) but not suicide death (adjusted hazard ratio 
      1.08; 95% CI 0.93-1.27). After applying the clone-censor-weight approach, there 
      was no association between antipsychotic augmentation and reduced risk of suicide 
      attempt (hazard ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.89-1.29) or suicide death (hazard ratio 
      1.22; 95% CI 0.91-1.71). However, antipsychotic users had increased risk of 
      all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.21; 95% CI 1.07-1.33). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Antipsychotic augmentation was not associated with reduced risk of 
      suicide-related outcomes when time-lag bias was addressed; however, it was 
      associated with increased all-cause mortality. These findings do not support the 
      use of antipsychotic augmentation in patients with treatment-resistant 
      depression.

TI  - Atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin in acute myocardial infarction with elevated 
      liver enzymes: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 796-808
LID - 10.1007/s00392-025-02645-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins are associated with liver-related adverse events, with risk 
      varying by statin type. However, current guidelines lack specific recommendations 
      for statin selection in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with elevated 
      liver enzymes. METHODS: This cohort study used a target trial emulation approach 
      to include AMI patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention between 
      2013 and 2022 from the Tianjin Health and Medical Data Platform, China. Eligible 
      patients with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin prescriptions during hospitalization 
      were matched 1:1 using propensity scores in those with elevated liver enzymes and 
      normal liver enzymes respectively, and tracked for 1 year or until death 
      (intention-to-treat analysis). Nonadherent patients were censored in the 
      per-protocol analysis. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality, with 
      secondary outcomes including recurrent MI and stroke. RESULTS: In a matched 
      cohort of 25,728 patients with elevated liver enzymes, 614 deaths (2.4%) 
      occurred. Atorvastatin was associated with higher all-cause mortality compared to 
      rosuvastatin (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.51), 
      consistent in the per-protocol analysis, and the in-hospital mortality difference 
      was confirmed in an independent cohort. No significant differences were observed 
      for recurrent MI (HR: 0.98, 95% CI 0.87-1.11) or stroke (HR: 1.10, 95% CI 
      0.93-1.28). Similar target trial emulation design among 18,270 AMI patients with 
      normal liver enzymes at admission (9135 per group) found no significant 
      differences between the two statins in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.09, 95% CI 
      0.88-1.35), recurrent MI (HR: 1.05, 95% CI 0.90-1.23), or stroke (HR: 1.07, 95% 
      CI 0.90-1.28). CONCLUSIONS: Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a higher 
      risk of 1-year all-cause mortality than Rosuvastatin in a target trial emulation 
      study of patients with elevated liver enzymes following AMI.

TI  - Nonprescription Magnesium Supplement Use and Risk of Heart Failure in Patients 
      With Diabetes: A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - e038870
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.124.038870 [doi]
LID - e038870
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both diabetes and low magnesium-containing food intake may increase 
      the risk of heart failure (HF). However, the effect of nonprescription magnesium 
      supplements on the risk of HF or major adverse cardiac events in patients with 
      diabetes is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a target-trial-emulation 
      approach, we assembled a national cohort of 94 239 veterans ≥40 years with 
      diabetes, without prior HF or magnesium use, who received ambulatory care in the 
      US veterans-health care system documented by electronic clinic notes between 
      January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2020. A natural language processing approach was 
      used to detect self-reported magnesium-supplement use from clinic notes, n=17 619 
      were identified as users versus n=76 620 as nonusers. Using inverse probability 
      treatment weighting, we constructed a cohort balanced in 88 baseline 
      characteristics between users and nonusers. The primary outcome was incident HF. 
      Secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, 
      stroke, HF hospitalization, or death). Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with 
      magnesium-supplement use and outcomes were estimated in the inverse probability 
      treatment weighting weighted cohort using Cox regression. The inverse probability 
      treatment weighting weighted cohort had a mean age of 67.4±10.3 years; 18.4% were 
      Black, and 5.1% were women. The mean duration of magnesium-supplement use was 
      3.5±3.1 (interquartile range, 1.1-5.1) years. Incident HF occurred in 8.0% of 
      users and 9.7% of nonusers of magnesium supplements (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 
      0.89-0.99]). Magnesium-supplement use was also associated with a reduced risk of 
      major adverse cardiac events (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.97]). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Long-term nonprescription magnesium supplement use was associated with a lower 
      risk of incident HF and major adverse cardiac events in patients with diabetes. 
      These findings should be replicated in randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Early special educational needs provision and its impact on unplanned hospital 
      utilisation and school absences in children with isolated cleft lip and/or 
      palate: a demonstration target trial emulation study protocol using ECHILD.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.3310/nihropenres.13472.1 [doi]
LID - 54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Special educational needs (SEN) provision is designed to help pupils 
      with additional educational, behavioural or health needs; for example, pupils 
      with cleft lip and/or palate may be offered SEN provision to improve their speech 
      and language skills. Our aim is to contribute to the literature and assess the 
      impact of SEN provision on health and educational outcomes for a well-defined 
      population. METHODS: We will use the ECHILD database, which links educational and 
      health records across England. Our target population consists of children 
      identified within ECHILD to have a specific congenital anomaly: isolated cleft 
      lip and/or palate. We will apply a trial emulation framework to reduce biases in 
      design and analysis of observational data to investigate the causal impact of SEN 
      provision (including none) by the start of compulsory education (Year One - age 
      five year on entry) on the number of unplanned hospital utilisation and school 
      absences by the end of primary education (Year Six - age ten/eleven). We will use 
      propensity score-based estimators (inverse probability weighting (IPW) and IPW 
      regression adjustment IPW) to compare categories of SEN provision in terms of 
      these outcomes and to triangulate results obtained using complementary estimation 
      methods (Naïve estimator, multivariable regression, parametric g-formula, and if 
      possible, instrumental variables), targeting a variety of causal contrasts 
      (average treatment effect/in the treated/in the not treated) of SEN provision. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate the impact of reasonable adjustments at the 
      start of compulsory education on health and educational outcomes in the isolated 
      cleft lip and palate population by triangulating complementary methods under a 
      target-trial framework.

OAB - Children born with cleft lip and/or palate have been shown to have lower academic 
      performance compared to the general population and have also been shown to have 
      higher attendances to hospitals. To support children with such health and 
      education needs, special educational needs provisions such as teaching assistants 
      can be provided. The aim of this study is to understand whether children with 
      cleft lip and/or palate were better off on average in receiving special education 
      needs at the start of primary school in terms of hospital usage and school 
      absences.

TI  - Effectiveness of molnupiravir vs nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in non-hospitalised and 
      hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 102225
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.102225 [doi]
LID - 102225
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir have emerged as promising 
      options for COVID-19 treatment, but direct comparisons of their effectiveness 
      have been limited. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these two 
      oral antiviral drugs in non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients with COVID-19. 
      METHODS: In this target trial emulation study, we used data from a territory-wide 
      electronic health records database on eligible patients aged ≥18 years infected 
      with COVID-19 who were prescribed either molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 
      within five days of infection between 16 March 2022 and 31 December 2022 in the 
      non-hospitalised and hospitalised settings in Hong Kong. A sequence trial 
      approach and 1:1 propensity score matching was applied based on age, sex, number 
      of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, Charlson comorbidity index, comorbidities, 
      and drug use within past 90 days. Cox regression adjusted with patients' 
      characteristics was used to compare the risk of effectiveness outcomes (all-cause 
      mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or ventilatory support and 
      hospitalisation) between groups. Subgroup analyses included age (<70; ≥70 years); 
      sex, Charlson comorbidity index (<4; ≥4), and number of COVID-19 vaccine doses 
      received (0-1; ≥2 doses). FINDINGS: A total of 63,522 non-hospitalised 
      (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 31,761; molnupiravir: 31,761) and 11,784 hospitalised 
      (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 5892; molnupiravir: 5892) patients were included. In 
      non-hospitalised setting, 336 events of all-cause mortality 
      (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 71, 0.22%; molnupiravir: 265, 0.83%), 162 events of ICU 
      admission or ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 71, 0.22%; 
      molnupiravir: 91, 0.29%), and 4890 events of hospitalisation 
      (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 1853, 5.83%; molnupiravir: 3037, 9.56%) were observed. 
      Lower risks of all-cause mortality (absolute risk reduction (ARR) at 28 days: 
      0.61%, 95% CI: 0.50-0.72; HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.33-0.56) and hospital admission 
      (ARR at 28 days: 3.73%, 95% CI: 3.31-4.14; HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.67-0.76) were 
      observed in nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users compared to molnupiravir users. In 
      hospitalised setting, 509 events of all-cause mortality (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 
      176, 2.99%; molnupiravir: 333, 5.65%), and 50 events of ICU admission or 
      ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 26, 0.44%; molnupiravir: 24, 0.41%) 
      were observed. Risk of all-cause mortality was lower for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 
      users than for molnupiravir users (ARR at 28 days: 2.66%, 95% CI: 1.93-3.40; HR: 
      0.59, 95% CI: 0.49-0.71). In both settings, there was no difference in the risk 
      of intensive care unit admission or ventilatory support between groups. The 
      findings were consistent across all subgroup's analyses. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      analyses suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was more effective than molnupiravir 
      in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality in both non-hospitalised and 
      hospitalised patients. When neither drug is contraindicated, 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be considered the more effective option. FUNDING: HMRF

TI  - Risk of suicide in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving different oral 
      anticoagulants: a nationwide analysis using target trial emulation framework.
PG  - 451
LID - 10.1186/s12916-024-03645-z [doi]
LID - 451
AB  - BACKGROUND: The suicide risk in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving novel 
      oral anticoagulants or warfarin has not been evaluated in real-world practice. 
      Moreover, reducing vitamin K levels may increase the suicide risk, underscoring 
      the importance of selecting appropriate oral anticoagulants to prevent unintended 
      outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between different types 
      of oral anticoagulants and the risk of attempted and completed suicide among 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: This nationwide study retrieved data 
      from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from 2012 to 2020. This 
      study included patients with atrial fibrillation aged 20 years and older who 
      newly received oral anticoagulant treatment, and who had no contraindications for 
      NOACs and no history of suicide-related events. The main outcomes were 
      suicide-related outcomes, including attempted suicide and completed suicide. This 
      study employed the target trial emulation framework to improve the causal 
      inference for the observed association.  RESULTS: A total of 103,768 (71.74%) 
      patients taking NOACs and 40,877 (28.26%) patients taking warfarin were included 
      in this study. Compared to those receiving warfarin, patients receiving NOACs 
      were associated with a lower risk of suicide-related outcomes (HR, 0.82; 95% CIs, 
      0.69-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this cohort study suggested that 
      patients receiving NOACs were associated with a lower risk of suicidal attempts 
      but similar risk of complete suicide, compared to those receiving warfarin. 
      Considering the risk of suicide, NOACs could be the preferred anticoagulants for 
      patients with atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Sex differences in the survival benefit of kidney transplantation: a 
      retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation.
PG  - 36-44
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfad137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for eligible 
      patients with kidney failure who need renal replacement therapy. However, it 
      remains unclear whether the anticipated survival benefit from kidney 
      transplantation is different for women and men. METHODS: We included all dialysis 
      patients recorded in the Austrian Dialysis and Transplant Registry who were 
      waitlisted for their first kidney transplant between 2000 and 2018. In order to 
      estimate the causal effect of kidney transplantation on 10-year restricted mean 
      survival time, we mimicked a series of controlled clinical trials and applied 
      inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted sequential Cox models. 
      RESULTS: This study included 4408 patients (33% female) with a mean age of 52 
      years. Glomerulonephritis was the most common primary renal disease both in women 
      (27%) and men (28%). Kidney transplantation led to a gain of 2.22 years (95% CI 
      1.88 to 2.49) compared with dialysis over a 10-year follow-up. The effect was 
      smaller in women (1.95 years, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.41) than in men (2.35 years, 95% 
      CI 1.92 to 2.70) due to a better survival on dialysis. Across ages the survival 
      benefit of transplantation over a follow-up of 10 years was smaller in younger 
      women and men and increased with age, showing a peak for both women and men aged 
      about 60 years. CONCLUSIONS: There were few differences in survival benefit by 
      transplantation between females and males. Females had better survival than males 
      on the waitlist receiving dialysis and similar survival to males after 
      transplantation.

TI  - Impact of special educational needs provision on hospital utilisation, school 
      attainment and absences for children in English primary schools stratified by 
      gestational age at birth: A target trial emulation study protocol.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.3310/nihropenres.13471.1 [doi]
LID - 59
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One third of children in English primary schools have additional 
      learning support called special educational needs (SEN) provision, but children 
      born preterm are more likely to have SEN than those born at term. We aim to 
      assess the impact of SEN provision on health and education outcomes in children 
      grouped by gestational age at birth. METHODS: We will analyse linked 
      administrative data for England using the Education and Child Health Insights 
      from Linked Data (ECHILD) database. A target trial emulation approach will be 
      used to specify data extraction from ECHILD, comparisons of interest and our 
      analysis plan. Our target population is all children enrolled in year one of 
      state-funded primary school in England who were born in an NHS hospital in 
      England between 2003 and 2008, grouped by gestational age at birth (extremely 
      preterm (24-<28 weeks), very preterm (28-<32 weeks), moderately preterm (32-<34 
      weeks), late preterm (34-<37 weeks) and full term (37-<42 weeks). The 
      intervention of interest will comprise categories of SEN provision (including 
      none) during year one (age five/six). The outcomes of interest are rates of 
      unplanned hospital utilisation, educational attainment, and absences by the end 
      of primary school education (year six, age 11). We will triangulate results from 
      complementary estimation methods including the naïve estimator, multivariable 
      regression, g-formula, inverse probability weighting, inverse probability 
      weighting with regression adjustment and instrumental variables, along with a 
      variety for a variety of causal contrasts (average treatment effect, overall, and 
      on the treated/not treated). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We have existing research 
      ethics approval for analyses of the ECHILD database described in this protocol. 
      We will disseminate our findings to diverse audiences (academics, relevant 
      government departments, service users and providers) through seminars, 
      peer-reviewed publications, short briefing reports and infographics for 
      non-academics (published on the study website).

OAB - One third of all children need extra help with learning in school, such as 
      support from a teaching assistant. Children born preterm are more likely to need 
      extra help compared to those born at term. In England, this help is called 
      special educational needs (SEN) provision. The aim of this study is to find out 
      whether special educational need provision affects education and health outcomes. 
      We will use information collected by hospitals and schools for all children who 
      were born in England between 2003 and 2008. We will compare those with who 
      received and did not receive extra help in school who have a similar gestational 
      age at birth.

TI  - Effect of different durations of treatment with antihypertensive drugs with 
      anticholinergic effects on the risk of dementia: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 691-698
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae263 [doi]
AB  - Studying the effect of duration of treatment on prognostic outcomes using 
      real-world data is challenging because only people who survive for a long time 
      can receive a treatment for a long time. Specifying a target trial helps overcome 
      such challenge. We aimed to estimate the effect of different durations of 
      treatment with antihypertensive drugs with anticholinergic properties (AC AHT) on 
      the risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease by emulating a target trial 
      using the UK CPRD GOLD database (2001-2017). Comparing treatment for 3-6 years vs 
      ≤3 years yielded null results for both types of dementia. Comparing a longer 
      duration of treatment, >6 years vs ≤3 years, yielded a 10-year risk ratio of 0.69 
      (95% CI, 0.54-0.90) for vascular dementia and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.77-1.10) for 
      Alzheimer's disease. For illustration, we performed an analysis that failed to 
      emulate a target trial by assigning exposure categories using postbaseline 
      information, obtaining implausible beneficial estimates. Our findings indicate a

TI  - Effect of Thrombolytics on Delayed Reperfusion After Incomplete Thrombectomy: 
      Target Trial Emulation.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000213641 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: More than half of the endovascularly treated ischemic 
      stroke patients with incomplete reperfusion (expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral 
      Infarction [eTICI] <3) show delayed reperfusion (DR) on 24-hour perfusion 
      imaging, which is associated with favorable clinical outcome. The effect of 
      intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) on the rates of DR remains unclear. This study 
      aimed to assess the treatment effect of IVT on the occurrence of DR. METHODS: 
      Pooled data from 3 randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA and EXTEND-IA TNK 
      parts 1 and 2) and 2 comprehensive stroke centers (University Hospitals Graz and 
      Bern) were analyzed. Only patients with a final reperfusion score of eTICI 2a-2c 
      and available perfusion imaging at follow-up of 24 ± 12 hours were included. The 
      primary outcome was the presence of DR on 24-hour follow-up CT/MRI perfusion 
      imaging, defined as the absence of any focal perfusion deficit on perfusion 
      imaging, despite incomplete reperfusion on the final angiography series during 
      thrombectomy. For the secondary analysis, we explored the association between the 
      primary outcome (DR) and the time elapsed between start of IVT and the end of an 
      intervention. To address confounding in observational data, we performed a target 
      trial emulation. RESULTS: Of 832 included patients with eTICI 2a-2c (median age 
      74 years, 49% female), 511 (61%) had DR. There was an independent treatment 
      effect of IVT on DR (standardized risk ratio [sRR] 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3; 
      standardized risk difference [sRD] 8.2%, 95% CI 0.2%-16.1%), after adjusting for 
      age, sex, atrial fibrillation, number of device passes, collateral score, and 
      eTICI. Among those patients who have received IVT (n = 524/832, 63%), when 
      adjusting for the aforementioned covariates, there was a causal effect of shorter 
      time between administration of thrombolytics and end of the intervention on DR 
      (sRR 0.93%, 95% CI 0.87-0.98; sRD -5.2%; 95% CI -9.1% to -1.3%, per hour 
      increase). DISCUSSION: Exposure to thrombolytics showed independent treatment 
      effect on the occurrence of DR among patients with incomplete reperfusion after 
      thrombectomy who undergo perfusion imaging at the 24-hour follow-up. The effect 
      of thrombolytics on DR was observed if there was a high chance of therapeutic 
      concentrations of thrombolytics at the time point when the proximal vessel was 
      recanalized, but distal occlusions persisted and/or occurred. CLASSIFICATION OF 
      EVIDENCE: This study is rated Class III because it is a nonrandomized study and 
      there are substantial differences in baseline characteristics of the treatment 
      groups.

TI  - Long-term effect of pharmacological treatment on academic achievement of 
      Norwegian children diagnosed with ADHD: a target trial emulation.
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyaf010 [doi]
LID - dyaf010
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most 
      commonly diagnosed mental disorders in children. For many patients, treatment 
      involves long-term medication in order to reduce symptoms, regulate behaviour, 
      and, hopefully, improve school performance and achievement. However, there is 
      little to no evidence to support a long-term effect on the latter complex 
      outcomes. METHODS: We utilize a target trial framework to emulate a 
      pretest-posttest control group design and estimate the intention-to-treat effect 
      of ADHD medication on national test scores in children diagnosed with ADHD born 
      between 2000 and 2007 in Norway. The data were obtained through linkage of 
      Norwegian registries (NorPD, Norwegian Prescription Database; NPR, Norwegian 
      Patient Registry; KUHR, Database for Control and Payment of Health Reimbursement; 
      SSB, Statistics Norway; MBRN, Medical Birth Registry of Norway). RESULTS: The 
      resulting analytic sample size consisted of 8548 children diagnosed with ADHD, 
      with about 9% missingness in their grade eight national test scores. We find that 
      initiating ADHD medication had a slight positive average effect on national test 
      scores for all three domains: English, numeracy, and reading [standardized mean 
      differences: 0.037 (95% compatibility interval (CI95), -0.003; 0.076), 0.063 
      (CI95, 0.016; 0.111), 0.071 (CI95, 0.030; 0.111), respectively]. CONCLUSION: We 
      conclude that the estimated long-term average effect of ADHD medication on 
      learning, as measured by the Norwegian national tests, is not clinically 
      relevant. Study strengths include the use of real-world data on ecologically 
      valid and relevant outcomes and the robustness of results across model 
      specifications. Limitations include possibility of unobserved confounding and 
      lack of prescription data.

      several medical conditions that are risk factors for dementia.ObjectiveWe aim to 
      investigate if semaglutide is associated with a decreased risk of 
      dementia.MethodsWe conducted emulation target trials based on a nationwide 
      population-based database of patient electronic health records (EHRs) in the US 
      among 1,710,995 eligible patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) comparing 
      semaglutide with other antidiabetic medications. First-time diagnosis of 
      Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD) including vascular dementia, 
      frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia and other dementias were examined 
      using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses during a 3-year 
      follow-up. Models were adjusted by propensity-score matching.ResultsWe show that 
      semaglutide was associated with a significantly reduced risk of overall ADRD 
      incidence with a hazard ratio ranging from 0.54 (0.49-0.59) compared with 
      insulin, 0.67 (0.61-0.74) compared with metformin, to 0.80 (0.72-0.89) compared 
      with older generation glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1RAs). The 
      association varied for specific dementia types, with significantly reduced risk 
      of vascular dementia and no evidence of associations with frontotemporal and Lewy 
      body dementias.ConclusionsThese findings provide evidence supporting protective 
      effects of semaglutide on dementias in patients with T2D. Future works are needed 
      to establish the causal relationships through randomized clinical trials and to 
      characterize the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Comparative Safety of Gout Treatment Strategies on Cardiovascular Outcomes Using 
      Observational Data: Clone-censor-weight Target Trial Emulation Approach.
PG  - 544-553
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001608 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to examine the cardiovascular safety of intensive 
      treat-to-target serum urate strategies for gout using Medicare claims data linked 
      to electronic health record laboratory data. METHODS: We selected patients with 
      gout who initiated urate-lowering therapy. We emulated a hypothetical trial 
      comparing the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial 
      infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) among seven different 
      strategies over 24 months. Three aspects were considered in defining increasingly 
      intensive strategies: (1) continuation of urate-lowering therapy, (2) serum urate 
      monitoring, and (3) modification of urate-lowering therapy when serum urate 
      >6 mg/dl. We applied the "clone-censor-weight" method to account for baseline and 
      time-varying confounding. RESULTS: We identified 4402 patients with gout who 
      initiated urate-lowering therapy (mean age 77; male 60%). During a total of 6611 
      person-years (PY) of follow-up under usual care, the rate of major cardiovascular 
      events (first and recurrent) was 4.5/100 PY (95% CI = 4.0, 5.1). The rate ratios 
      (RRs) suggested reductions (RR point estimates 0.88-0.84) compared with usual 
      care. All 95% CIs were imprecise, but their upper bounds excluded substantial 
      increase in RRs. RRs were closer to 1.0 for the analysis focusing on the first 
      major adverse cardiovascular event during follow-up and on comparison to the 
      strategy requiring continuation of urate-lowering therapy (but not necessarily 
      titration). CONCLUSIONS: Our treatment strategy trial emulation did not find 
      increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with intensive 
      urate-lowering strategies. Results may provide reassurance of the cardiovascular 
      safety of intensive treat-to-target serum urate strategies recommended by 
      rheumatology societies.

TI  - Effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment following diagnosis of 
      depression on suicidal behaviour risk: a target trial emulation.
PG  - 1760-1768
LID - 10.1038/s41386-023-01676-3 [doi]
AB  - There is concern regarding the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs) on suicidal behaviour. Using the target trial framework, we investigated 
      the effect on suicidal behaviour of SSRI treatment following a depression 
      diagnosis. We identified 162,267 individuals receiving a depression diagnosis 
      aged 6-59 years during 2006-2018 in Stockholm County, Sweden, after at least 1 
      year without antidepressant dispensation. Individuals who initiated an SSRI 
      within 28 days of the diagnosis were assigned as SSRI initiators, others as 
      non-initiators. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects were estimated; for 
      the latter, individuals were censored when they ceased adhering to their assigned 
      treatment strategy. We applied inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for 
      baseline confounding in the intention-to-treat analysis, and additionally for 
      treatment non-adherence and time-varying confounding in the per-protocol 
      analysis. The suicidal behaviour risk difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR) 
      between SSRI initiators and non-initiators were estimated at 12 weeks. In the 
      overall cohort, we found an increased risk of suicidal behaviour among SSRI 
      initiators (intention-to-treat RR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.25, 1.80; per-protocol 
      RR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.20, 2.36). In age strata, we only found evidence of an 
      increased risk among individuals under age 25, with the greatest risk among 
      6-17-year-olds (intention-to-treat RR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.72, 4.91; per-protocol 
      RR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.59, 7.00). Our finding of an increased suicidal behaviour 
      risk among individuals under age 25 reflects evidence from RCTs. We found no 
      evidence of an effect in the high-risk group of individuals with past suicidal 
      behaviour. Further studies with information on a wider array of confounders are 
      called for.

AB  - Observational studies provide the only evidence on the effectiveness of 
      interventions when randomized controlled trials (RCTs) - apart from the initial 
      RCT that establishes the efficacy of a treatment compared to a placebo - are 
      impractical due to cost, ethical concerns, or time constraints. While many 
      methodologies aim to draw causal inferences from observational data, there is a 
      growing trend to model observational study designs after hypothetical or existing 
      RCTs, a strategy known as "target trial emulation." Despite its potential, causal 
      inference through target trial emulation is challenging because it cannot fully 
      address the confounding bias inherent in real-world data due to the lack of 
      randomization. In this work, we present a novel framework for target trial 
      emulation that aims to overcome several key limitations, including confounding 
      bias. The framework proceeds as follows: First, we apply the eligibility criteria 
      of a specific trial to an observational cohort derived from real-world data. We 
      then "correct" this cohort by extracting a subset that, through optimization 
      techniques, matches both the distribution of covariates and baseline prognoses 
      (i.e., the prognosis in the trial's control group) of the target RCT. Next, we 
      address unmeasured confounding by adjusting the prognosis estimates of the 
      treated group to align with those observed in the trial, using cost-sensitive 
      counterfactual models. Following trial emulation, we go a step further by 
      leveraging the emulated cohort to train optimal decision trees, developed by our 
      team, to identify subgroups of patients exhibiting heterogeneity in treatment 
      effects (HTE). The absence of confounding is verified using two external models, 
      and the validity of the treatment effects estimated by our framework is 
      independently confirmed by the team responsible for the original trial we 
      emulate. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to successfully address 
      both observed and unobserved confounding, a challenge that has historically 
      limited the use of randomized trial emulation and causal inference in general 
      since the 1950s. Additionally, our framework holds promise in advancing precision 
      or personalized medicine by identifying patient subgroups that benefit most from 
      specific treatments.

      diabetes: a target trial emulation.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) are antidiabetic agents 
      recently approved for weight loss. Obesity is an established risk factor for 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE). Moreover, preclinical studies have shown that 
      GLP1-RA may attenuate thromboxane-induced platelet activation. Therefore, we 
      hypothesized that GLP1-RA use may reduce the risk of VTE. We performed a target 
      trial emulation (TTE) using a population-based database of electronic health 
      records to evaluate whether GLP1-RA use is associated with a reduction in VTE in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i). Patients who were newly initiated on GLP1-RA were 
      propensity score matched to patients who were newly initiated on DPP4i. We 
      evaluated the primary outcome, composite VTE, identified using ICD-10 
      (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes, within 12 
      months of the initiation of GLP1-RA or DPP4i. The study cohort comprised 540 258 
      patients with 270 129 individuals receiving either GLP1-RA or DPP4i. Over 12 
      months of follow-up, patients who received GLP1-RA had a lower incidence of VTE 
      compared with patients who received DPP4i (6.1 vs 7.6 events per 1000 
      patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.83). 
      This was similar for pulmonary embolism (2.9 vs 3.8 events per 1000 
      patient-years; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68-0.82) and deep vein thrombosis (3.9 vs 4.7 
      events per 1000 patient-years; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.88). In this propensity 
      score-matched, TTE study, patients with T2DM who received a GLP1-RA had a lower 
      risk of VTE at 1 year compared with patients who received DPP4i.

AB  - AIMS: To compare the effects of low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel on the risk of 
      incident type 2 diabetes among patients with ASCVD. METHODS: This target trial 
      emulation study was performed usingthe IQVIA Medical Research Data UK primary 
      care database, including adults with an incident first ASCVD event who initiated 
      low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel between 2004 and 2021. We applied an overlap 
      weighting approach to balance treatment groups. The observational analogues of 
      intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects were estimated using pooled logistic 
      regression. RESULTS: A total of 111,292 ASCVD patients who initiated aspirin 
      (n = 78,012) or clopidogrel (n = 33,280) were included. In intention-to-treat 
      analyses, aspirin and clopidogrel had similar risks of diabetes (Hazard ratio 
      [HR] 1.02, 95 % Confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 1.07), cardiovascular events 
      (1.00, 0.95 to 1.05), and bleeding events (1.02, 0.97 to 1.08). In per-protocol 
      analyses, risks remained comparable for diabetes (1.06, 0.97 to 1.15), 
      cardiovascular events (0.96, 0.89 to 1.03), and bleeding events (1.01, 0.92 to 
      1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin and clopidogrel have similar risks of incident 
      diabetes, cardiovascular events, and bleeding events among patients with ASCVD. 
      The choice between these agents may thus be influenced more by factors like cost, 
      patient preference, or tolerance than by clinical outcomes alone.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of covid-19 vaccination on the severity of 
      symptoms in patients with long covid. DESIGN: Target trial emulation based on 
      ComPaRe e-cohort. DATA SOURCE: ComPaRe long covid cohort, a nationwide e-cohort 
      (ie, a cohort where recruitment and follow-up are performed online) of patients 
      with long covid, in France. METHODS: Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) enrolled in 
      the ComPaRe cohort before 1 May 2021 were included in the study if they reported 
      a confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptoms persistent for >3 weeks 
      after onset, and at least one symptom attributable to long covid at baseline. 
      Patients who received a first covid-19 vaccine injection were matched with an 
      unvaccinated control group in a 1:1 ratio according to their propensity scores. 
      Number of long covid symptoms, rate of complete remission of long covid, and 
      proportion of patients reporting an unacceptable symptom state at 120 days were 
      recorded. RESULTS: 910 patients were included in the analyses (455 in the 
      vaccinated group and 455 in the control group). By 120 days, vaccination had 
      reduced the number of long covid symptoms (mean 13.0 (standard deviation 9.4) in 
      the vaccinated group v 14.8 (9.8) in the control group; mean difference -1.8, 
      95% confidence interval -3.0 to -0.5) and doubled the rate of patients in 
      remission (16.6% v 7.5%, hazard ratio 1.93, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 
      3.14). Vaccination reduced the effect of long covid on patients' lives (mean 
      score on the impact tool 24.3 (standard deviation 16.7) v 27.6 (16.7); mean 
      difference -3.3, 95% confidence interval -5.7 to -1.0) and the proportion of 
      patients with an unacceptable symptom state (38.9% v 46.4%, risk difference 
      -7.4%, 95% confidence interval -14.5% to -0.3%). In the vaccinated group, two 
      (0.4%) patients reported serious adverse events requiring admission to hospital. 
      CONCLUSION: In this study, covid-19 vaccination reduced the severity of symptoms 
      and the effect of long covid on patients' social, professional, and family lives 
      at 120 days in those with persistent symptoms of infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aim to use real-world data in evidence synthesis to optimize an 
      evidence base for the effectiveness of biologic therapies in rheumatoid arthritis 
      to allow for evidence on first-line therapies to inform second-line effectiveness 
      estimates. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We use data from the British Society for 
      Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis to supplement randomized 
      controlled trials evidence obtained from the literature, by emulating target 
      trials of treatment sequences to estimate treatment effects in each line of 
      therapy. Treatment effects estimates from the target trials inform a bivariate 
      network meta-analysis (NMA) of first-line and second-line treatments. RESULTS: 
      Summary data were obtained from 21 trials of biologic therapies including two for 
      second-line treatment and results from six emulated target trials of both 
      treatment lines. Bivariate NMA resulted in a decrease in uncertainty around the 
      effectiveness estimates of the second-line therapies, when compared to the 
      results of univariate NMA, and allowed for predictions of treatment effects not 
      evaluated in second-line randomized controlled trials. CONCLUSION: Bivariate NMA 
      provides effectiveness estimates for all treatments in first and second line, 
      including predicted effects in second line where these estimates did not exist in 
      the data. This novel methodology may have further applications; for example, for 
      bridging networks of trials in children and adults.

TI  - Validation of Machine Learning-Based Individualized Treatment for Depressive 
      Disorder Using Target Trial Emulation.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11121316 [doi]
LID - 1316
AB  - This study aims to develop and validate the use of machine learning-based 
      prediction models to select individualized pharmacological treatment for patients 
      with depressive disorder. This study used data from Taiwan's National Health 
      Insurance Research Database. Patients with incident depressive disorders were 
      included in this study. The study outcome was treatment failure, which was 
      defined as psychiatric hospitalization, self-harm hospitalization, emergency 
      visits, or treatment change. Prediction models based on the Super Learner 
      ensemble were trained separately for the initial and the next-step treatments if 
      the previous treatments failed. An individualized treatment strategy was 
      developed for selecting the drug with the lowest probability of treatment failure 
      for each patient as the model-selected regimen. We emulated clinical trials to 
      estimate the effectiveness of individualized treatments. The area under the curve 
      of the prediction model using Super Learner was 0.627 and 0.751 for the initial 
      treatment and the next-step treatment, respectively. Model-selected regimens were 
      associated with reduced treatment failure rates, with a 0.84-fold (95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.82-0.86) decrease for the initial treatment and a 0.82-fold (95% 
      CI 0.80-0.83) decrease for the next-step. In emulation of clinical trials, the 
      model-selected regimen was associated with a reduced treatment failure rate.

TI  - Bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase versus endovascular thrombectomy alone 
      for large-vessel anterior circulation stroke: a target trial emulation analysis.
PG  - 775-783
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2024-335325 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase is beneficial 
      compared with thrombectomy alone in patients who had a stroke with large-vessel 
      occlusion remains unclear. METHODS: This is a causal inference study of 
      observational data from the trials SWIFT DIRECT and EXTEND-IA TNK Parts 1 and 2 
      applying target trial emulation. We compared patients receiving thrombectomy 
      alone to patients receiving tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or 0.40 mg/kg before 
      thrombectomy. The primary outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin 
      Scale (mRS) of 0-2) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included improvement over the 
      full ordinal mRS scale, freedom of disability (mRS 0-1), mortality and occurrence 
      of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. The average causal treatment effect was 
      estimated via inverse probability of treatment weighting and G-Computation. We 
      calculated standardised risk differences (SRDs) and adjusted (common) ORs 
      (a(c)ORs). RESULTS: Of 377 patients included in the target trial, 187 received 
      thrombectomy alone and 190 tenecteplase before thrombectomy. Tenecteplase before 
      thrombectomy did not increase the probability of patients achieving functional 
      independence (SRD 0.04 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.13)) but resulted in a significant 
      improvement in the mRS overall (acOR 1.56 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.23)) and in a higher 
      probability of freedom from disability (SRD 0.10 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.20)). The 
      probability for improvement of functional outcomes was further increased in 
      patients treated within 140 min after onset (ordinal mRS acOR 1.63 (95% CI 1.04 
      to 2.56)). No significant differences in safety outcomes were observed between 
      the two groups. CONCLUSION: Tenecteplase before thrombectomy compared with 
      thrombectomy alone did not increase the probability of functional independence 
      but resulted in significant improvement over the full mRS scale. This improvement 
      was most evident in patients treated early.

TI  - Effect of statin treatment on the risk of cancer in patients with heart failure: 
      A target trial emulation study.
PG  - e5775
LID - 10.1002/pds.5775 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A recent observational study suggested statins could reduce cancer 
      diagnosis in patients with heart failure (HF). The findings need to be validated 
      using robust epidemiological methods. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 
      statin treatment on the risk of cancer in patients with HF. METHODS: We conducted 
      two target trial emulations using primary care data from IQVIA Medical Research 
      Database-UK (2000 to 2019) with a clone-censor-weight design. The first emulated 
      trial addressed the treatment initiation effect: initiating within 1 year versus 
      not initiating a statin after the HF diagnosis. The second emulated trial 
      addressed the cumulative exposure effect: continuing a statin for ≤3 years, 
      3-6 years, and >6 years after initiation. The study outcomes were any incident 
      cancer and site-specific cancer diagnoses. Weighted pooled logistic regression 
      models were used to estimate 10-year risk ratios (RR). 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: The first 
      emulated trial showed that, compared to no statin, statins did not reduce the 
      cancer risk in patients with HF (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.15). The second 
      emulated trial showed that, compared to treatment ≤3 years, statins with longer 
      durations did not reduce the cancer risk (3-6 years: RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.70-1.33. 
      >6 years: RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.26). No significant risk difference was 
      observed on any site-specific cancer diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the 
      target trial emulations suggest that statin treatment is not associated with 
      cancer risk in patients with HF.

PG  - 944-952
LID - 10.1002/pds.5491 [doi]
AB  - With availability of voluminous sets of observational data, an empirical paradigm 
      to screen for drug repurposing opportunities (i.e., beneficial effects of drugs 
      on nonindicated outcomes) is feasible. In this article, we use a linked claims 
      and electronic health record database to comprehensively explore repurposing 
      effects of antihypertensive drugs. We follow a target trial emulation framework 
      for causal inference to emulate randomized controlled trials estimating 
      confounding adjusted effects of antihypertensives on each of 262 outcomes of 
      interest. We then fit hierarchical models to the results as a form of 
      postprocessing to account for multiple comparisons and to sift through the 
      results in a principled way. Our motivation is twofold. We seek both to surface 
      genuinely intriguing drug repurposing opportunities and to elucidate through a 
      real application some study design decisions and potential biases that arise in 
      this context.

TI  - Assessing the cardiovascular effects of levothyroxine use in an ageing United 
      Kingdom population (ACEL-UK) protocol: a cohort and target trial emulation study.
PG  - 43

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subclinical hypothyroidism is diagnosed when serum thyroid 
      stimulating hormone levels are higher whilst free thyroxine levels remain within 
      their respective reference ranges. These reference ranges are uniformly applied 
      in all adults, despite serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels naturally 
      increasing with age. Research has found that mildly elevated thyroid stimulating 
      hormone levels may be associated with some benefits in ageing patients, including 
      reduced mortality and better cardiorespiratory fitness. Levothyroxine is 
      typically prescribed to patients with hypothyroidism, but no conclusive evidence 
      exists on whether levothyroxine therapy is beneficial or detrimental in older 
      subclinical hypothyroid patients. Despite this, prescriptions for levothyroxine 
      are increasing year-on-year. This study aims to determine if receiving 
      levothyroxine affects the cardiovascular and bone health outcomes of subclinical 
      patients in primary care aged 50 years and over. METHODS: This project includes a 
      retrospective cohort analysis and a target trial emulation study using electronic 
      patient records collected between 2006 and 2021 and recorded in The Health 
      Improvement Network database. The primary outcome of this study is to compare the 
      cardiovascular outcomes of subclinical hypothyroid patients aged over 50 years 
      treated with levothyroxine compared to those untreated. Secondary outcomes are 
      bone health and all-cause mortality outcomes. Descriptive and inferential 
      statistics will both be employed to analyse the data. Secondary analysis will 
      explore confounding factors, including age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, 
      co-morbidities, and levothyroxine dosage. DISCUSSION: There needs to be a greater 
      understanding of the potential risks of the current treatment for older patients 
      with subclinical hypothyroidism in a primary care setting. We will investigate 
      the clinical importance of this issue and whether older subclinical hypothyroid 
      patients have poorer outcomes when treated. Clarifying this concern may help 
      address the healthcare resource implications of ageing patients being 
      misclassified as having mild hypothyroidism, as these patients are more likely to 
      repeat their blood tests. This could reduce prescription wastage and improve 
      patient outcomes and quality of life in the ageing population. TRIAL

TI  - Impact of arteriovenous fistula formation on trajectory of kidney function 
      decline: a target trial emulation.
PG  - sfae345
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfae345 [doi]
LID - sfae345
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior nonrandomized studies have suggested nephroprotective effects 
      of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) formation, but these are plausibly susceptible to 
      immortal time and selection biases. METHODS: We studied patients attending 
      nephrology clinics in the West of Scotland during 2010-22 with an estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and no prior AVF. Using 
      target trial emulation and a sequential trial design, we simulated a hypothetical 
      trial that would randomize patients to either undergo AVF formation immediately 
      or not to undergo AVF formation. The primary outcome was the difference in eGFR 
      slope for the first 6 months of follow-up, estimated using a mixed-effects model. 
      The secondary outcomes were 5-year absolute risks of dialysis and death, 
      estimated using the Aalen-Johansen and Kaplan-Meier estimators respectively. 
      RESULTS: A total of 1364 unique patients (mean age 51.1 years, 55.7% male) 
      contributed 3125 person-trials, with 561 in the AVF and 2564 in the no AVF group. 
      Mean eGFR was 12.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and the median number of eGFR measurements 
      per person-trial was 7 (interquartile range 4-12). Slope of eGFR decline did not 
      differ significantly between the AVF and no AVF groups (between-group difference 
      -0.67 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year, 95% CI -1.43, 0.10). The 5-year absolute risk of 
      dialysis was 87% (95% CI 84, 91) in the AVF group and 75% (95% CI 73, 77) in the 
      no AVF group, and the 5-year survival probability was 77% (95% CI 70, 83) in the 
      AVF group and 67% (95% CI 64, 69) in the no AVF group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study 
      of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, there was no evidence of a 
      nephroprotective effect of AVF formation.

TI  - Trajectory of blood pressure after initiating anti-calcitonin gene-related 
      peptide treatment of migraine: a target trial emulation from the veterans health 
      administration.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/s10194-023-01640-y [doi]
LID - 108
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is involved in migraine 
      pathophysiology and blood pressure regulation. Although clinical trials have 
      established the cardio-cerebrovascular safety profile of anti-CGRP treatment, 
      limited high-quality real-world evidence exists on its long-term effects on blood 
      pressure (BP). To address this gap, we examined the safety of anti-CGRP treatment 
      on BP in patients with migraine headache in the Veterans Health Administration 
      (VHA). METHODS: We emulated a target trial of patients who initiated anti-CGRP 
      treatment or topiramate for migraine prevention between May 17th, 2018 and 
      February 28th, 2023. We calculated stabilized inverse probability weights to 
      balance between groups and then used weighted linear mixed-effect models to 
      estimate the systolic and diastolic BP changes over the study period. For 
      patients without hypertension at baseline, we estimated the cumulative incidence 
      of hypertension using Kaplan-Meier curve. We also used weight mixed-effect 
      Poisson model to estimate the number of antihypertension medications for patients 
      with hypertension at baseline. RESULTS: This analysis included 69,589 patients 
      and 554,437 blood pressure readings. of these, 18,880 patients received anti-CGRP 
      treatment, and they were more likely to be women, have a chronic migraine 
      diagnosis and higher healthcare utilization than those received topiramate. Among 
      patients without hypertension at baseline, we found no significant differences in 
      systolic BP changes over the four-year follow-up between anti-CGRP (slope 
      [standard error, SE] = 0.48[0.06]) and topiramate treated patients 
      (slope[SE] = 0.39[0.04]). The incidence of hypertension was similar for anti-CGRP 
      and topiramate group (4.4 vs 4.3 per 100 person-years). Among patients with 
      hypertension at baseline who initiated anti-CGRP treatment, we found a small but 
      persistent effect on exacerbating hypertension during the first four years of 
      treatment, as evidenced by a significant annual 3.7% increase in the number of 
      antihypertensive medications prescribed (RR = 1.037, 95%CI 1.025-1.048). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that anti-CGRP treatment is safe regarding 
      blood pressure in patients without hypertension. However, for those with baseline 
      hypertension, anti-CGRP treatment resulted in a small but persistent increase in 
      the number of antihypertensives, indicating an exacerbation of hypertension. 
      Future studies are needed to evaluate the cardio-cerebrovascular safety of 
      anti-CGRP treatment beyond the first four years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of primary cytoreductive surgery vs interval cytoreductive 
      surgery on International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV ovarian 
      cancer outcomes remains uncertain and may vary depending on the stage and the 
      location of extraperitoneal metastasis. Emulating target trials through causal 
      assessment, combined with propensity score adjustment, has become a leading 
      method for evaluating interventions using observational data. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to assess the effect of primary vs interval cytoreductive surgery on 
      progression-free and overall survival in patients with International Federation 
      of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV ovarian cancer using target trial 
      emulation. STUDY DESIGN: Using the comprehensive French national health insurance 
      database, we emulated a target trial to explore the causal impacts of primary vs 
      interval cytoreductive surgery on stage IV ovarian cancer prognosis (Surgery for 
      Ovarian cancer FIGO 4: SOFI-4). The clone method with inverse probability of 
      censoring weighting was used to adjust for informative censoring and to balance 
      baseline characteristics between the groups. Subgroup analyses were conducted 
      based on the stages and extraperitoneal metastasis locations. The study included 
      patients younger than 75 years of age, in good health condition, who were 
      diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 
      2022. The primary and secondary outcomes were respectively 5-year 
      progression-free survival and 7-year overall survival. RESULTS: Among the 2772 
      patients included in the study, 948 (34.2%) were classified as having stage IVA 
      ovarian cancer and 1824 (65.8%) were classified as having stage IVB ovarian 
      cancer at inclusion. Primary cytoreductive surgery was performed for 1182 
      patients (42.6%), whereas interval cytoreductive surgery was conducted for 1590 
      patients (57.4%). The median progression-free survival for primary cytoreductive 
      surgery was 19.7 months (interquartile range, 19.3-20.1) as opposed to 15.7 
      months (interquartile range, 15.7-16.1) for those who underwent interval 
      cytoreductive surgery. The median overall survival was 63.1 months (interquartile 
      range, 61.7-65.4) for primary cytoreductive surgery in comparison with 55.6 
      months (interquartile range, 53.8-56.3) for interval cytoreductive surgery. The 
      findings of our study indicate that primary cytoreductive surgery is associated 
      with a 5.0-month increase in the 5-year progression-free survival (95% confidence 
      interval, 3.8-6.2) and a 3.9-month increase in 7-year overall survival (95% 
      confidence interval, 1.9-6.2). These survival benefits of primary over interval 
      cytoreductive surgery were observed in both the International Federation of 
      Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IVA and IVB subgroups. Primary cytoreductive 
      surgery demonstrated improved progression-free survival and overall survival in 
      patients with pleural, supradiaphragmatic, or extra-abdominal lymph node 
      metastasis. CONCLUSION: This study advocates for the benefits of primary 
      cytoreductive surgery over interval cytoreductive surgery for patients with stage 
      IV ovarian cancer and suggests that extraperitoneal metastases like 
      supradiaphragmatic or extra-abdominal lymph nodes should not automatically 
      preclude primary cytoreductive surgery consideration in suitable patients.

TI  - Comparative cardiovascular effectiveness of newer glucose-lowering drugs in 
      elderly with type 2 diabetes: a target trial emulation cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reducing risk of cardiovascular disease is crucial in managing type 2 
      diabetes (T2D). This study assessed the comparative cardiovascular effectiveness 
      of newer glucose-lowering drugs in real-world elderly individuals with T2D, and 
      examined how age modified these effects. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study 
      using Danish nationwide registries to emulate a three-arm randomized clinical 
      trial. Participants aged ≥70 years were new users of glucagon-like peptide 1 
      receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors 
      (SGLT-2is), or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), between 2012 and 
      2020. We estimated the overall and age-specific incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 
      3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (3P-MACE) and hospitalization for 
      heart failure (HHF) using Poisson regression models. Summarized weights were used 
      to balance baseline characteristics and treatment adherence. FINDINGS: The study 
      included 35,679 participants (DPP-4is: 21,848 (62%), GLP1-RAs: 5702 (16%), 
      SGLT-2is: 8129 (23%)). In the as-treated analysis, GLP1-RAs and SGLT-2is were 
      associated with significantly reduced rates of 3P-MACE and HHF compared to 
      DPP-4is. The overall IRR for 3P-MACE was 0.68 (95% CI 0.65-0.71) (GLP1-RAs vs. 
      DPP4is) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.63-0.68) (SGLT-2is vs. DPP4is), while for HHF the IRR 
      was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.88) (GLP1-RAs vs. DPP4is) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.55-0.66) 
      (SGLT-2is vs. DPP4is). These effects were predominantly independent of age. No 
      significant difference was observed between SGLT-2is and GLP1-RAs on 3P-MACE, 
      however, SGLT-2is were associated with a significant reduction of HHF, compared 
      to GLP1-RAs, with an overall IRR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67-0.83), and with 
      age-dependent variations for both outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In the elderly, use 
      of GLP1-RAs and SGLT-2is was associated with reduced rates of 3P-MACE and HHF 
      compared to DPP-4is, independent of age. SGLT-2is were also associated with 
      reduced rates of HHF compared to GLP1-RAs, largely independent of age, in this 
      population of individuals aged 70 years and above. This provides real-world 
      evidence on the comparative cardiovascular effectiveness of the three most recent 
      glucose-lowering medications and may help strengthen implementation of guidelines 
      into clinical practice. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Metformin Versus Sulfonylureas on Exceptional 
      Longevity in Women With Type 2 Diabetes: Target Trial Emulation.
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glaf095 [doi]
LID - glaf095
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of metformin with mortality has been mixed, and no 
      prior study has determined whether metformin initiation is associated with 
      exceptional longevity, defined as survival to ages 90 and older. METHODS: We 
      performed a new-user, active comparator cohort study using the target trial 
      emulation framework among the Women's Health Initiative cohort to determine 
      whether metformin versus sulfonylurea initiation was associated with exceptional 
      longevity (survival to age 90). We identified participants ≥60 years with 
      incident type 2 diabetes and no history of hypoglycemic agents or insulin prior 
      to treatment initiation to perform intention-to-treat analyses. We used 1:1 
      propensity score matching on demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, 
      diabetes duration, comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer), body mass index, and concomitant 
      medications to balance treatment groups on key confounders. RESULTS: Among 438 
      propensity score-matched women with type 2 diabetes, the incidence rate of death 
      before age 90 per 100 person-years in women initiating metformin monotherapy was 
      3.7 (95% CI: 3.1-4.4) compared with 5.0 (95% CI: 4.2-5.8) for sulfonylurea 
      monotherapy. The adjusted risk of death before age 90 was 30% lower for 
      initiation of metformin monotherapy versus sulfonylurea monotherapy (hazard 
      ratio, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this first target trial 
      emulation of metformin and exceptional longevity, we found that metformin 
      initiation increased exceptional longevity compared with sulfonylurea initiation 
      among women with type 2 diabetes. Because this comparison was not made to placebo 
      in a randomized controlled trial and given the observational design with 
      potential for residual confounding, causality cannot be inferred.

TI  - Effectiveness of COVID-19 treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or molnupiravir 
      among U.S. Veterans: target trial emulation studies with one-month and six-month 
      outcomes.
LID - 2022.12.05.22283134 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information about the effectiveness of oral antivirals in preventing 
      short- and long-term COVID-19-related outcomes during the Omicron surge is 
      limited. We sought to determine the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 
      molnupiravir for the outpatient treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted 
      three retrospective target trial emulation studies comparing matched patient 
      cohorts who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no treatment, molnupiravir 
      versus no treatment, and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus molnupiravir in the 
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Participants were Veterans in VHA care at 
      risk for severe COVID-19 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the outpatient 
      setting during January and February 2022. Primary outcomes included all-cause 
      30-day hospitalization or death and 31-180-day incidence of acute or long-term 
      care admission, death, or post-COVID-19 conditions. For 30-day outcomes, we 
      calculated unadjusted risk rates, risk differences, and risk ratios. For 
      31-180-day outcomes, we used unadjusted time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: 
      Participants were 90% male with median age 67 years and 26% unvaccinated. 
      Compared to matched untreated controls, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir-treated 
      participants (N=1,587) had a lower 30-day risk of hospitalization (27.10/1000 
      versus 41.06/1000, risk difference [RD] - 13.97, 95% CI -23.85 to -4.09) and 
      death (3.15/1000 versus 14.86/1000, RD -11.71, 95% CI - 16.07 to -7.35). Among 
      persons who were alive at day 31, further significant reductions in 31-180-day 
      incidence of hospitalization (sub-hazard ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.37) or 
      death (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.08) were not observed. 
      Molnupiravir-treated participants aged â‰¥65 years (n=543) had a lower combined 
      30-day risk of hospitalization or death (55.25/1000 versus 82.35/1000, RD -27.10, 
      95% CI -50.63 to -3.58). A statistically significant difference in 30-day or 
      31-180-day risk of hospitalization or death was not observed between matched 
      nirmatrelvir- or molnupiravir-treated participants. Incidence of most post-COVID 
      conditions was similar across comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was highly effective in preventing 30-day hospitalization 
      and death. Short-term benefit from molnupiravir was observed in older groups. 
      Significant reductions in adverse outcomes from 31-180 days were not observed 
      with either antiviral.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccination Effectiveness Against Infection or Death in a National U.S. 
      Health Care System : A Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 352-361
LID - 10.7326/M21-3256 [doi]
LID - M21-3256
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      in racially and ethnically diverse, elderly populations with high comorbidity 
      burden. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of messenger RNA COVID-19 
      vaccines. DESIGN: Target trial emulation study comparing newly vaccinated persons 
      with matched unvaccinated controls. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
      health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Among persons receiving care in the Veterans 
      Affairs health care system (n = 5 766 638), those who received at least 1 dose of 
      the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from 11 December 2020 to 25 March 
      2021 (n = 2 099 871) were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio 
      according to demographic, clinical, and geographic characteristics. INTERVENTION: 
      Follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as death 
      within 30 days of infection, began after the vaccination date or an identical 
      index date for the matched unvaccinated controls and continued until up to 30 
      June 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection or 
      SARS-CoV-2-related death. RESULTS: Vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were well 
      matched; both were predominantly male (92.9% vs. 93.4%), had advanced age (mean, 
      68.7 years in both groups), had diverse racial and ethnic distribution (for 
      example, Black: 17.3% vs. 17.0%, Hispanic: 6.5% vs. 6.1%), and had substantial 
      comorbidity burden. Vaccine effectiveness 7 or more days after the second vaccine 
      dose was 69% (95% CI, 67% to 70%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 86% (CI, 82% 
      to 89%) against SARS-CoV-2-related death and was similar when follow-up was 
      extended to 31 March versus 30 June. Vaccine effectiveness against infection 
      decreased with increasing age and comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly 
      male population and lack of data on SARS-CoV-2 variants. CONCLUSION: In an 
      elderly, diverse, high-comorbidity population, COVID-19 VE against infection was 
      substantially lower than previously reported, but VE against death was high. 
      Complementary infection mitigation efforts remain important for pandemic control, 
      even with vaccination. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: U.S. Department of Veterans 
      Affairs.

TI  - Impact of CoronaVac on Covid-19 outcomes of elderly adults in a large and 
      socially unequal Brazilian city: A target trial emulation study.
PG  - 5742-5751
LID - S0264-410X(23)00908-8 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although CoronaVac was the only Covid-19 vaccine adopted in the first 
      months of the Brazilian vaccination campaign, randomized clinical trials to 
      evaluate its efficacy in elderly adults were limited. In this study, we use 
      routinely collected surveillance and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and testing data 
      comprising the population of the fifth largest city of Brazil to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of CoronaVac in adults 60+ years old against severe outcomes. 
      METHODS: Using large observational databases on vaccination and surveillance data 
      from the city of Fortaleza, Brazil, we defined a retrospective cohort including 
      324,302 eligible adults aged ≥60 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
      CoronaVac vaccine. The cohort included individuals vaccinated between January 21, 
      2021, and August 31, 2021, who were matched with unvaccinated persons at the time 
      of rollout following a 1:1 ratio according to baseline covariates of age, sex, 
      and Human Development Index of the neighborhood of residence. Only 
      Covid-19-related severe outcomes were included in the analysis: hospitalization, 
      ICU admission, and death. Vaccine effectiveness for each outcome was calculated 
      by using the risk ratio between the two groups, with the risk obtained by the 
      Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: We obtained 62,643 matched pairs for assessing 
      the effectiveness of the two-dose regimen of CoronaVac. The demographic profile 
      of the matched population was statistically representative of the population of 
      Fortaleza. Using the cumulative incidence as the risk associated with each group, 
      starting at day 14 since the receipt of the second dose, we found an 82.3 % (95 % 
      CI 66.3-93.9) effectiveness against Covid-19-related death, 68.4 % (95 % CI 
      42.3-86.4) against ICU admission, and 55.8 % (95 % CI 42.7-68.3) against hospital 
      admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that, despite critical delays in vaccine 
      delivery and limited evidence in efficacy trial estimates, CoronaVac contributed 
      to preventing deaths and severe morbidity due to Covid-19 in elderly adults.

TI  - Hybrid immunity against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 following a previous 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in children and 
      adolescents: a target trial emulation.
PG  - e495-e505
LID - S2666-5247(23)00103-9 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although most children and adolescents have had a previous SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and many continue to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, studies of the 
      effectiveness of hybrid immunity against reinfection with the omicron (B.1.1.529) 
      variant are scarce. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of vaccination in 
      convalescent children and adolescents against reinfection with the delta 
      (B.1.617.2) variant and the BA.1 and BA.2 and BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants. 
      METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was devised to emulate a target 
      randomised control trial using a retrospective dataset of anonymised health 
      records of children (5-11 years old) and adolescents (12-16 years old) who were 
      members of the Maccabi Healthcare Services, Israel. The design emulated 91 
      randomised trials by devising a series of multiple nested trials, compiling the 
      results into a single dataset, and fitting Cox proportional hazards models to 
      estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs of each measured outcome. The 
      primary aim was to assess the protection from reinfection with the delta variant 
      and the BA.1 and BA.2 and BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants associated with 
      hybrid immunity as a result of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by 
      vaccination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. FINDINGS: Data from 
      between from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2022, for 163 812 individuals (120 721 
      children [59 404 girls and 61 317 boys], median age 8·0 years [IQR 6·7 to 10·2]; 
      and 43 091 adolescents [21 239 girls and 21 852 boys], median age 13·5 years 
      [12·6 to 14·8]) were included in at least one trial. A single dose of the 
      BNT162b2 vaccine in convalescent children and adolescents confers statistically 
      significant protection against the delta variant (78% [95% CI 72 to 83] in 
      adolescents and 64% [3 to 87] in children) and the omicron BA.1 and BA.2 
      subvariants (54% [50 to 57] in adolescents and 71% [67 to 73] in children) 
      compared with children who had a previous infection but were unvaccinated. 
      However, the vaccine was not found to confer statistically significant protection 
      against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants in adolescents (8% [-18 to 29]) and 
      children (12% [-6 to 27]). INTERPRETATION: Decision makers in BA.4 and BA.5 
      dominant regions should re-examine whether convalescent individuals aged 5-16 
      years should receive the BNT162b2 vaccine to prevent future reinfection, 
      especially in light of reports that show that most children and adolescents have 
      already been infected with SARS-CoV-2. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Multigene Panel Sequencing in 
      Advanced Melanoma: A Population-Level Real-World Target Trial Emulation.

AB  - PURPOSE: Targeted therapy and immunotherapy promise improved survival in patients 
      with advanced melanoma, yet the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multigene 
      panel sequencing compared with single-gene BRAF testing to guide therapeutic 
      decisions is unknown. METHODS: Our population-based quasi-experimental 
      retrospective target trial emulation used comprehensive patient-level data for 
      364 British Columbia, Canada, adults with an advanced melanoma diagnosis 
      receiving multigene panel sequencing or single-gene BRAF testing between 
      September 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018. We 1:1 matched multigene panel patients 
      to controls using genetic algorithm-based matching. Outcomes included 3-year 
      overall survival (OS) and health care costs (2021 Canadian dollars [CAD]) with 
      incremental net monetary benefit for life-years gained (LYG). Outcomes were 
      analyzed using inverse probability of censoring weighted linear regression for 
      the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect. The per-protocol (PP) effect estimation also 
      included stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights. We then used 
      Weibull regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: We matched 147 
      multigene panel patients to controls, achieving balance for all covariates. After 
      matching, ITT incremental costs were $19,447 CAD (95% CI, -$18,516 to $76,006) 
      and incremental LYG were 0.22 (95% CI, -0.05 to 0.49). We found uncertainty in 
      differences on OS using Kaplan-Meier (P = .11) and Weibull regression (hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.03]) in the ITT. PP incremental costs were 
      $36,367 CAD (95% CI, -$6,653 to $120,216]) and incremental LYG were 0.56 (95% CI, 
      0.39 to 1.24), with corresponding differences in OS using Kaplan-Meier (P = .02) 
      and Weibull regression (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.87]). The probability of 
      multigene panels being cost-effective at $100,000/LYG CAD was 55% for ITT and 65% 
      for PP. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of multigene panels was evenly poised 
      at higher thresholds, even when accounting for treatment initiation. Health 
      systems reimbursing multigene panels and expensive therapies may be confronted 
      with a value tradeoff, in which there may be improved survival albeit with a 
      modest change in cost-effectiveness.

AB  - AIM: To estimate the effect of a sustained physical activity intervention on 
      12-year risk of late-life depressive symptoms among older adults. METHODS: We 
      emulated a target trial of a sustained intervention of moderate to vigorous 
      physical activity at least twice a week using data from the Health and Retirement 
      Survey (HRS) and English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). The HRS included 
      10,735 eligible participants (57.5 % women; 65.8y ± 9.4) and the ELSA included 
      4898 participants (54.0 % women, 66.3y ± 9.2). We adjusted for pre-baseline, 
      baseline and time-varying risk factors using parametric g-formula to estimate the 
      12-year risk of depressive symptoms under the physical activity intervention vs 
      under natural course. RESULTS: The estimated 12-year risk of developing 
      depressive symptoms was 44.3 % (95%CI: 36.2; 51.1) under natural course and 
      39.1 % (32.5; 45.9) under the physical activity intervention, resulting in a risk 
      difference of -5.20 percentage points (-7.40; -2.37) in the HRS. In the ELSA, the 
      risk was 64.8 % (58.9; 73.4) under natural course vs 56.1 % (49.3; 64.5) under 
      the physical activity intervention, resulting in a risk difference of -8.70 
      percentage points (-11.78; -6.14). CONCLUSION: We estimated that older adults 
      have experienced a lower incidence of depressive symptoms under a long-term 
      sustained intervention of physical activity.

TI  - Comparison of Moderna versus Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outcomes: A target 
      trial emulation study in the U.S. Veterans Affairs healthcare system.
PG  - 101326
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101326 [doi]
LID - 101326
AB  - BACKGROUND: mRNA COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and 
      Moderna (mRNA-1273) have been shown to be efficacious but have not been compared 
      in head-to-head clinical trials. METHODS: We designed this observational study to 
      emulate a target trial of COVID-19 vaccination by BNT162b2 versus mRNA-1273 among 
      persons who underwent vaccination in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) 
      healthcare system from 11/12/2020 to 25/03/2021 using combined VA and Medicare 
      electronic health records. We identified the best matching mRNA-1273 recipient(s) 
      for each BNT162b2 recipient, using exact/coarsened-exact matching (calendar week, 
      VA integrated service network, age buckets and Charlson comorbidity index 
      buckets) followed by propensity score matching. Vaccine recipients were followed 
      from the date of first vaccine dose until 25/08/2021 for the development of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization or SARS-CoV-2-related 
      death. FINDINGS: Each group included 902,235 well-matched vaccine recipients, 
      followed for a mean of 192 days, during which 16,890 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 3591 
      SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and 381 SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were 
      documented. Compared to BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 recipients had significantly lower 
      risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.736, 95% CI 
      0.696-0.779) and SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization (aHR 0.633, 95% CI 
      0.562-0.713), which persisted across all age groups, comorbidity burden 
      categories and black/white race. The differences between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 
      in risk of infection or hospitalization were progressively greater when the 
      follow-up period was longer, i.e. extending to March 31, June 30 or August 25, 
      2021. These differences were more pronounced when we analyzed separately the 
      outcomes that occurred during the follow-up period from July 1 to August 25, 2021 
      when the Delta variant became predominant in the U.S. (aHR for infection 0.584, 
      95% CI 0.533-0.639 and aHR for hospitalization 0.387, 95% 0.311-0.482). 
      SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were less common in mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 
      recipients (168 versus 213) but this difference was not statistically significant 
      (aHR 0.808, 95% CI 0.592-1.103). INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, although absolute 
      rates of infection, hospitalization and death in both vaccine groups were low 
      regardless of the vaccine received, our data suggests that compared to BNT162b2, 
      vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significantly lower rates of 
      SARS-CoV-2-infection and SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization. These differences 
      were greater with longer follow-up time since vaccination and even more 
      pronounced in the Delta variant era. FUNDING: U.S. Department of Veterans

TI  - Management of high-risk acute pulmonary embolism: an emulated target trial 
      analysis.
PG  - 490-505
LID - 10.1007/s00134-025-07805-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-risk acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening 
      condition necessitating hemodynamic stabilization and rapid restoration of 
      pulmonary perfusion. In this context, evidence regarding the benefit of advanced 
      circulatory support and pulmonary recanalization strategies is still limited. 
      METHODS: In this observational study, we assessed data of 1060 patients treated 
      for high-risk acute PE with 991 being included in a target trial emulation to 
      investigate all-cause in-hospital mortality estimates with different advanced 
      treatment strategies. The four treatment groups consisted of patients undergoing 
      (I) veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) alone (n = 126), 
      (II) intrahospital systemic thrombolysis (SYS) (n = 643), (III) surgical 
      thrombectomy (ST) (n = 49), and (IV) percutaneous catheter-directed treatment 
      (PCDT) (n = 173). VA-ECMO was allowed as bridging to pulmonary recanalization in 
      groups II, III, and IV. Marginal causal contrasts were estimated using the 
      g-formula with logistic regression models as the primary approach. Sensitivity 
      analyses included targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with machine 
      learning, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), as well as 
      variations of estimands, handling of missing values, and a complete target trial 
      emulation excluding the VA-ECMO alone group. RESULTS: In the overall target trial 
      population, the median age was 62.0 years, and 53.3% of patients were male. The 
      estimated probability of in-hospital mortality from the primary target trial 
      intention-to-treat analysis for VA-ECMO alone was 57% (95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 47%; 67%), compared to 48% (95% CI 44%; 53%) for intrahospital SYS, 34% 
      (95%CI 18%; 50%) for ST, and 43% (95% CI 35%; 51%) for PCDT. The mortality risk 
      ratios were largely in favor of any advanced recanalization strategy over VA-ECMO 
      alone. The robustness of these findings was supported by all sensitivity 
      analyses. In the crude outcome analysis, patients surviving to discharge had a 
      high probability of favorable neurologic outcome in all treatment groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Advanced recanalization by means of SYS, ST, and several promising 
      catheter-directed systems may have a positive impact on short-term survival of 
      patients presenting with high-risk PE compared to the use of VA-ECMO alone as a 
      bridge to recovery.

TI  - Association of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists With Liver-Related 
      Outcomes and All-Cause Mortality in Patients With Harmful Alcohol Use: A Target 
      Trial Emulation Study.
LID - 10.14309/ajg.0000000000003585 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anecdotal observations report a decrease in craving for alcohol 
      among patients taking glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA). We 
      aimed to assess liver-related outcomes and mortality among individuals with 
      harmful alcohol use who received GLP-1 RAs. METHODS: We emulated a target trial 
      using the electronic health records of US Veterans with positive alcohol use 
      disorders-concise score (AUDIT-C), comparing new initiators of GLP-1 RA between 
      1/3/2017 and 9/30/2024, with controls, with follow-up until outcomes or study 
      end. Each GLP-1 RA new user with a positive AUDIT-C screen was propensity score 
      (PS) matched 1:1 with a patient not on a GLP-1 RA. The primary outcomes were the 
      time to a composite outcome of decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
      liver-related death, and all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome was the 
      proportion of patients with positive AUDIT-C scores. RESULTS: We matched 8,040 
      patients with positive AUDIT-C initiated on GLP-1 RA with 8,040 noninitiators. 
      GLP-1 RA use was associated with a lower risk of composite liver-related outcomes 
      (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.87) and 
      death (aHR 0.43, 95% CI 0.37-0.49). Among semaglutide users, a 1 mg/wk dose 
      increase was associated with a reduced risk of composite liver-related outcomes 
      (aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.88) and death (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.58). GLP-1 RA use 
      was also associated with lower odds of positive AUDIT-C during follow-up 
      (adjusted Odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.82). DISCUSSION: In this observational 
      target trial emulation study, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a lower risk of 
      liver outcomes, death, and harmful alcohol use.

TI  - Observational methods for COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness research: an empirical 
      evaluation and target trial emulation.
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyad138 [doi]
LID - dyad138
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are scarce data on best practices to control for confounding in 
      observational studies assessing vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19. We 
      compared the performance of three well-established methods [overlap weighting, 
      inverse probability treatment weighting and propensity score (PS) matching] to 
      minimize confounding when comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated people. 
      Subsequently, we conducted a target trial emulation to study the ability of these 
      methods to replicate COVID-19 vaccine trials. METHODS: We included all 
      individuals aged ≥75 from primary care records from the UK [Clinical Practice 
      Research Datalink (CPRD) AURUM], who were not infected with or vaccinated against 
      SARS-CoV-2 as of 4 January 2021. Vaccination status was then defined based on 
      first COVID-19 vaccine dose exposure between 4 January 2021 and 28 January 2021. 
      Lasso regression was used to calculate PS. Location, age, prior observation time, 
      regional vaccination rates, testing effort and COVID-19 incidence rates at index 
      date were forced into the PS. Following PS weighting and matching, the three 
      methods were compared for remaining covariate imbalance and residual confounding. 
      Last, a target trial emulation comparing COVID-19 at 3 and 12 weeks after first 
      vaccine dose vs unvaccinated was conducted. RESULTS: Vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      cohorts comprised 583 813 and 332 315 individuals for weighting, respectively, 
      and 459 000 individuals in the matched cohorts. Overlap weighting performed best 
      in terms of minimizing confounding and systematic error. Overlap weighting 
      successfully replicated estimates from clinical trials for vaccine effectiveness 
      for ChAdOx1 (57%) and BNT162b2 (75%) at 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: Overlap weighting 
      performed best in our setting. Our results based on overlap weighting replicate 
      previous pivotal trials for the two first COVID-19 vaccines approved in Europe.

TI  - Can metformin prevent cancer relative to sulfonylureas? A target trial emulation 
      accounting for competing risks and poor overlap via double/debiased machine 
      learning estimators.
PG  - 512-523
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae217 [doi]
AB  - There is mounting interest in the possibility that metformin, indicated for 
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, has a range of additional beneficial 
      effects. Randomized trials have shown that metformin prevents adverse 
      cardiovascular events, and metformin use has also been associated with reduced 
      cognitive decline and cancer incidence. In this paper, we dig more deeply into 
      whether metformin prevents cancer by emulating target randomized trials comparing 
      metformin to sulfonylureas as first-line diabetes therapy using data from the 
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a UK primary-care database (1987-2018). We 
      included 93 353 individuals with diabetes, no prior cancer diagnosis, no chronic 
      kidney disease, and no prior diabetes therapy who initiated use of metformin 
      (n = 79 489) or a sulfonylurea (n = 13 864). In our cohort, the estimated 
      overlap-weighted additive separable direct effect of metformin compared with 
      sulfonylureas on cancer risk at 6 years was -1 percentage point (95% CI, -2.2 to 
      0.1), which is consistent with metformin's providing no direct protection against 
      cancer incidence or substantial protection. The analysis faced 2 methodological 
      challenges: (1) poor overlap and (2) precancer death as a competing risk. To 
      address these issues while minimizing nuisance model misspecification, we develop 
      and apply double/debiased machine learning estimators of overlap-weighted 
      separable effects in addition to more traditional effect estimates. This article 
      is part of a Special Collection on Pharmacoepidemiology.

TI  - Effectiveness of Ampicillin-Sulbactam Versus Ceftriaxone for the Initial 
      Treatment of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Older Adults: A Target Trial 
      Emulation Study.
PG  - ofaf133
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofaf133 [doi]
LID - ofaf133
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) include 
      ampicillin-sulbactam as an initial treatment option, though they do not mandate 
      routine coverage of anaerobic organisms. This study aimed to compare the 
      effectiveness of ampicillin-sulbactam with that of ceftriaxone as initial 
      treatment for CAP in older adults. METHODS: This study was conducted using the 
      target trial emulation framework, using a nationwide Japanese database (May 
      2010-June 2023). The study included patients aged ≥65 years, admitted to 
      Diagnosis Procedure Combination hospitals for CAP, who received either 
      ampicillin-sulbactam or ceftriaxone as the initial treatment. The exposure group 
      received ampicillin-sulbactam, while the control group received ceftriaxone, both 
      on the day of hospitalization. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; the 
      secondary outcome was the development of Clostridioides difficile infection 
      during hospitalization. RESULTS: The study included 26 633 older patients 
      hospitalized with CAP, with 14 906 receiving ampicillin-sulbactam and 11 727 
      receiving ceftriaxone as initial treatment. After inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting, the ampicillin-sulbactam group was associated with a higher 
      in-hospital mortality rate than the ceftriaxone group (10.5% vs 9.0%, 
      respectively; adjusted risk difference, 1.5% [95% confidence interval, .7%-2.4%]; 
      adjusted odds ratio, 1.19 [1.08-1.31]). The incidence of C difficile infection 
      was numerically higher in the ampicillin-sulbactam group (0.6% vs 0.4%; adjusted 
      risk difference, 0.2% [95% confidence interval, .0%-.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 
      1.45 [.99-2.11]). These results were consistent among patients with risk factors 
      for aspiration. CONCLUSIONS: In older patients with CAP, initial treatment with 
      ampicillin-sulbactam was associated with higher mortality compared to treatment 
      with ceftriaxone.

TI  - Hormone therapy and increased risk of psoriasis in reproductive-age and 
      postmenopausal women: a nationwide cohort study and target trial emulation.
PG  - 259-266
LID - 10.1093/bjd/ljaf179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely administered for contraception and 
      menopausal symptom management. However, its impact on psoriasis risk remains 
      unclear, requiring an evaluation across diverse age groups to inform clinical 
      practice and optimize treatment strategies. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 
      association between HT and the risk of psoriasis in reproductive-age and 
      postmenopausal women. METHODS: This study utilized both nationwide cohort design 
      and target trial emulation, analysing data from Taiwan's National Health 
      Insurance Database (2001-2021). Women over 20 years old without a prior history 
      of psoriasis, ovarian cancer or breast cancer were included, and categorized into 
      reproductive-age (≤ 50 years) and postmenopausal (> 50 years) groups. Women who 
      initiated HT were assigned as the exposed group, while women without HT formed 
      the comparison group. The primary outcome was the incidence of psoriasis over a 
      5-year period. The study applied inverse probability of treatment weighting 
      (IPTW) and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Both 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed to enhance 
      the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: In the postmenopausal cohort, comprising 
      1 482 302 HT users and 1 313 799 nonusers, the IPTW-adjusted HR for psoriasis in 
      the ITT analysis was 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-1.52]. The PP 
      analysis indicated a more pronounced risk, with an HR of 5.93 (95% CI 5.66-6.22). 
      Among the reproductive-age cohort, which included 3 849 721 HT users and 1 585 
      461 nonusers, the IPTW-adjusted HR in the ITT analysis was 1.93 (95% CI 
      1.90-1.99). In the PP analysis, the risk increased, showing an HR of 7.85 (95% CI 
      7.56-8.15). These findings highlight the significantly elevated psoriasis risk 
      associated with HT, especially in younger women. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      establishes an association between HT and an increased risk of psoriasis in both 
      reproductive-age and postmenopausal women using a nationwide cohort design and 
      target trial emulation. These findings further highlight the potential influence 
      of hormonal factors on psoriasis development. Clinicians should remain attentive 
      to early signs of psoriasis in women receiving HT to ensure timely recognition 
      and management.

OAB - Hormone therapy (HT) is commonly used by women for birth control and to relieve 
      some symptoms after menopause. Psoriasis is a long-term skin condition that 
      causes red, itchy and scaly patches. It affects about 2% of people and is linked 
      to problems with the immune system. Some studies have suggested that hormones may 
      affect psoriasis, but the risk for women using HT has not been clearly 
      understood. This study was carried out in Taiwan and used health records from 
      over 8 million women. We examined the health records from two groups of women: 
      those of reproductive age (50 years of age or younger) and those who were 
      postmenopausal (over 50 years of age). We then compared women who used HT with 
      those who did not, and followed their health records for 5 years to see who 
      developed psoriasis. Our results showed that women using HT had a higher risk of 
      developing psoriasis. In younger women, the risk was almost twice as high, and 
      even higher among those who used HT continuously. In postmenopausal women, the 
      risk was also increased, although it was slightly lower than in younger women. In 
      conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that hormones may play a role in 
      psoriasis. Women using HT should be aware of this possible side-effect. If people 
      notice changes in their skin, they should consult their doctor or a 
      dermatologist.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noncompressible truncal hemorrhage is a major contributor to 
      preventable deaths in trauma patients and, despite advances in emergency care, 
      still poses a big challenge. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the clinical

      uncontrolled torso or lower body hemorrhage. METHODS: This study utilized a 
      target trial design with a matched case-control methodology, emulating randomized 
      1 : 1 allocation for patients receiving trauma resuscitation care with or without 
      the use of REBOA. The study was conducted at a high-volume trauma center in 
      Southern Austria, including trauma patients treated between January 2019 and 
      October 2023, aged 16 and above, with suspected severe non-compressible torso 
      hemorrhage. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary 
      outcomes were in-hospital mortality rates at 3, 6, 24 h, and 90 days, need for 
      damage control procedures, time to these procedures, computed tomography (CT) 
      scan rates during resuscitation, complications, length of intensive care and 
      in-hospital stay, and causes of death. RESULTS: Median age was 55 [interquartile 
      range (IQR) 42-64] years. Median total injury severity, assessed by Injury 
      Severity Score, was 46.5 (IQR: 43-57). There was no significant difference in 
      30-day in-hospital mortality between groups [9/22 (41%) vs. 9/22 (41%), odds 
      ratio: 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3-3.36, P  > 0.999]. Lower mortality 
      rates within 3, 6, and 24 h were observed in the REBOA group; in a Cox 
      proportional hazards model, hazard ratio (95% CI) for mortality in the REBOA 
      group was 0.87 (0.35-2.15). Timing to damage control procedures did not 
      significantly differ between groups, although patients in the REBOA group 
      underwent significantly more CT scans. Bleeding was cited as the main cause of 
      death less frequently in the REBOA group. CONCLUSION: In severely injured 
      patients presenting with possible major non-compressible torso hemorrhage, a 
      systematically implemented resuscitation strategy including REBOA during the 
      initial hospital phase, is not associated with significant changes in mortality.

TI  - Immediate or delayed initiation of renal replacement therapy in patients with 
      leptospirosis and acute kidney injury: a target trial emulation.
PG  - 65

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anecdotal evidence suggests that early renal replacement therapy 
      (RRT) may improve the mortality associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in 
      patients with leptospirosis. Conversely, several randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) conducted in intensive care units have refuted the positive impact of 
      early RRT on mortality in patients with AKI and other causes of sepsis. METHODS: 
      In this emulated RCT utilizing a propensity score-weighted logistic regression 
      performed in the two academic centers on the island of La Réunion, France, 
      between 2010 and 2020, we evaluated the impact of the timing of RRT on a 
      composite outcome of mortality or new-onset or worsening chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) within a year, in patients hospitalized with leptospirosis, Stage 3 AKI, 
      and no immediate need for RRT. RESULTS: We included 295 consecutive patients with 
      leptospirosis and Stage 3 AKI: 82 (28%) began RRT within 48 h of admission 
      ("early" group), 213 (72%) did not start RRT within 48 h ("delayed" group). In 
      the delayed group, 53/213 (25%) patients eventually required RRT. 59/295 patients 
      (20%) met the primary outcome: 32 (15%) in the delayed group and 27 (33%) in the 
      early group. The odds ratio (OR) for primary outcome occurrence before weighing 
      was 2.78 (95% confidence interval CI 1.53 to 5.01, p < 0.001; reference: delayed 
      group) and after weighting was 2.08 (95% CI: 1.01 to 4.26, p = 0.046). In 
      secondary analyses, there was a significantly higher probability of CKD 
      occurrence in the early group (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.25 to 6.0, p = 0.012). Mortality 
      at 1 year did not differ between groups (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.68, 
      p = 0.666). CONCLUSION: Early initiation of RRT may be associated with an 
      increased risk of death and development of CKD within 1 year in patients with 
      leptospirosis and Stage 3 AKI.

TI  - Time-Dependent Effect of Prophylactic Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole on the 
      Incidence of Serious Infections in Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated 
      Vasculitis: A Target Trial Emulation Study.
LID - 10.1002/art.43185 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of 
      prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) on the incidence of serious 
      infections in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated 
      vasculitis (AAV). METHODS: This multicenter cohort study was designed to emulate 
      a target trial that studied 296 patients with AAV who were treated with rituximab 
      (RTX) or cyclophosphamide (CYC) as induction therapy. Patients were grouped based 
      on the administration of TMP-SMX within 14 days following induction therapy (n = 
      240 and 56 patients in prophylaxis and control groups, respectively) 
      (intention-to-treat) and also as a time-dependent exposure (time-varying). 
      Inverse probability weighting was applied to minimize the baseline imbalance 
      between the two groups. The primary outcome was one-year incidence of serious 
      infection. RESULTS: During the 252.1 person-years of observation, 77 cases of 
      serious infections were recorded in 65 patients with a fatality rate of 18.5%. 
      Most serious infections (n = 66, 85.7%) occurred within the first 180 days of 
      observation. The prophylaxis group showed a significantly lower incidence of 
      serious infections than the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48 [95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.32-0.72]). However, this beneficial effect of TMP-SMX was only 
      significant during the first 180 days (HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.22-0.76]) and not 
      thereafter (HR 3.67 [95% CI 0.46-29.43]) (interaction P = 0.044). This result was 
      also consistent with the time-varying analysis result. Based on one case of 
      severe adverse drug reaction related to TMP-SMX, the number needed to harm was 
      127.4, whereas the number needed to treat to prevent one serious infection was 
      8.0. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic TMP-SMX significantly reduced the risk of serious 
      infections in patients with AAV, particularly during the first six months of 
      induction therapy with RTX or CYC.

TI  - Early Mortality After the First Dose of COVID-19 Vaccination: A Target Trial 
      Emulation.
PG  - 625-632
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciad604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy persists alongside concerns about the safety of 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. We aimed to examine the effect of 
      COVID-19 vaccination on risk of death among US veterans. METHODS: We conducted a 
      target trial emulation to estimate and compare risk of death up to 60 days under 
      two COVID-19 vaccination strategies: vaccination within 7 days of enrollment 
      versus no vaccination through follow-up. The study cohort included individuals 
      aged ≥18 years enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration system and eligible 
      to receive a COVID-19 vaccination according to guideline recommendations from 1 
      March 2021 through 1 July 2021. The outcomes of interest included deaths from any 
      cause and excluding a COVID-19 diagnosis. Observations were cloned to both 
      treatment strategies, censored, and weighted to estimate per-protocol effects. 
      RESULTS: We included 3 158 507 veterans. Under the vaccination strategy, 364 993 
      received vaccine within 7 days. At 60 days, there were 156 deaths per 100 000 
      veterans under the vaccination strategy versus 185 deaths under the no 
      vaccination strategy, corresponding to an absolute risk difference of -25.9 (95% 
      confidence limit [CL], -59.5 to 2.7) and relative risk of 0.86 (95% CL, .7 to 
      1.0). When those with a COVID-19 infection in the first 60 days were censored, 
      the absolute risk difference was -20.6 (95% CL, -53.4 to 16.0) with a relative 
      risk of 0.88 (95% CL, .7 to 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against COVID-19 was 
      associated with a lower but not statistically significantly different risk of 
      death in the first 60 days. These results agree with prior scientific knowledge 
      suggesting vaccination is safe with the potential for substantial health 
      benefits.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The exclusion of pregnant women and infants from many randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) has left critical gaps in medication safety, 
      complicating clinical decision-making during these sensitive life stages. This 
      commentary explores target trial emulation using real-world data as a robust 
      alternative for advancing medication safety research when RCTs are not feasible. 
      METHODS: Target trial emulation replicates the design principles of RCTs within 
      observational data, accounting for the dynamic nature of medication exposure 
      across gestational stages and adjusting for time-varying confounders. While 
      challenges such as unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and violations of 
      positivity assumptions remain, this method provides crucial insights to address 
      current evidence gaps. RESULTS: Information on medication exposure effects will 
      be obtained, which will inform safer medication guidelines in pregnancy and 
      infancy. Future research integrating artificial intelligence-driven tools, open 
      science practices, and robust data governance frameworks will further strengthen 
      the reliability and impact of target trial emulation. Multinational collaboration 
      and data sharing across diverse sources will accelerate the generation of 
      evidence, ultimately advancing medication safety. CONCLUSION: Target trial 
      emulation, leveraging real-world data, is a promising alternative when 
      traditional clinical trials are not feasible. This approach promotes safer 
      medication use and improves health outcomes for mothers and infants. PLAIN 
      LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Many clinical trials exclude pregnant women and infants, 
      leaving critical gaps in understanding medication safety during pregnancy and 
      early life. Target trial emulation, which applies clinical trial principles to 
      real-world data, offers a promising alternative when traditional trials are not 
      feasible. This method allows researchers to study how medications affect pregnant 
      women and babies at different stages of pregnancy while also considering factors 
      that change over time. While there are still challenges, like unmeasured factors 
      and bias remain, target trial emulation helps fill these knowledge gaps. Future 
      advancements, including AI, Open Science, enhanced data sharing, and 
      international collaboration, can further enhance this method's ability to improve 
      the safety of medications for mothers and infants worldwide.

TI  - Effect of adjuvant chemotherapy after pancreatectomy in patients with 
      node-negative pancreatic cancer: target trial emulation.
LID - znad398 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znad398 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of adjuvant therapy in node-negative pancreatic cancer is 
      uncertain. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of adjuvant 
      chemotherapy on survival after surgery for pancreatic cancer in patients with 
      node-negative (pN0) and node-positive (pN+) disease using target trial emulation. 
      METHODS: This was an observational cohort study emulating a hypothetical RCT by 
      the clone-censor-weight approach using population-based Danish healthcare 
      registries. The study included Danish patients undergoing curative-intent surgery 
      for pancreatic cancer during 2008-2021, who were discharged alive no more than 4 
      weeks after surgery. At the time of discharge after surgery, the data for each 
      patient were duplicated; one copy was assigned to the adjuvant chemotherapy 
      strategy and the other to the no adjuvant chemotherapy strategy of the 
      hypothetical trial. Copies were censored when the assigned treatment was no 
      longer compatible with the observed treatment. To account for informative 
      censoring, uncensored patients were weighted according to measured confounders. 
      The primary outcomes were absolute difference in 2-year survival and median 
      overall survival, comparing adjuvant with no adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Some 
      424 patients with pN0 and 953 with pN+ disease were included. Of these, 62.0 and 
      74.6% respectively initiated adjuvant chemotherapy within the 8-week grace 
      period. Among patients with pN0 tumours, the difference in 2-year survival 
      between those with and without adjuvant therapy was -2.2 (95% c.i. -11.8 to 
      7.4)%. In those with pN+ disease, the difference in 2-year survival was 9.9 (1.6 
      to 18.1)%. Median overall survival was 24.9 (i.q.r. 12.8-49.4) and 15.0 
      (8.0-34.0) months for patients having adjuvant and no adjuvant therapy 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: In a target trial emulation using observational data, 
      adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve survival after surgery for node-negative 
      pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Later-age neutering causes lower risk of early-onset urinary incontinence than 
      early neutering-a VetCompass target trial emulation study.
PG  - e0305526

AB  - There is growing evidence supporting clinically important associations between 
      age at neutering in bitches and subsequent urinary incontinence (UI), although 
      much of this evidence to date is considered weak. Target trial emulation is an 
      innovative approach in causal inference that has gained substantial attention in 
      recent years, aiming to simulate a hypothetical randomised controlled trial by 
      leveraging observational data. Using anonymised veterinary clinical data from the 
      VetCompass Programme, this study applied the target trial emulation framework to 
      determine whether later-age neutering (≥ 7 to ≤ 18 months) causes decreased odds 
      of early-onset UI (diagnosed < 8.5 years) compared to early-age neutering (3 to < 
      7 months). The study included bitches in the VetCompass database born from 
      January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, and neutered between 3 and 18 months old. 
      Bitches were retrospectively confirmed from the electronic health records as 
      neutered early or later. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of early-onset UI. 
      Informed from a directed acyclic graph, data on the following covariates were 
      extracted: breed, insurance status, co-morbidities and veterinary group. Inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for confounding, with 
      inverse probability of censoring weighting accounting for censored bitches. The 
      emulated trial included 612 early-age neutered bitches and 888 later-age neutered 
      bitches. A pooled logistic regression outcome model identified bitches neutered 
      later at 0.80 times the odds (95% CI 0.54 to 0.97) of early-onset UI compared 
      with bitches neutered early. The findings show that later-age neutering causes 
      reduced odds of early-onset UI diagnosis compared with early-age neutering. 
      Decision-making on the age of neutering should be carefully considered, with 
      preference given to delaying neutering until after 7 months of age unless other 
      major reasons justify earlier surgery. The study is one of the first to 
      demonstrate successful application of the target trial framework to veterinary 
      observational data.

AB  - Bipolar disorder is associated with increased rates of many physical disorders, 
      but the effects of medication are unclear. We systematically investigated the 
      associations between sustained use of first line maintenance agents, lithium 
      versus lamotrigine and valproate, and the risk of physical disorders using a 
      nation-wide population-based target trial emulation covering the entire 5.9 
      million inhabitants in Denmark. We identified two cohorts. Cohort 1: patients 
      with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder prior to first purchase (N = 12.607). Cohort 
      2: all 156.678 adult patients who had their first ever purchase (since 1995) of 
      either lithium, lamotrigine or valproate between 1997 and 2021 regardless of 
      diagnosis. Main analyses investigated the effect of sustained exposure defined as 
      exposure for all consecutive 6-months periods during a 10-year follow-up. 
      Outcomes included a diagnosis of incident stroke, arteriosclerosis, angina 
      pectoris, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, myxedema, osteoporosis, 
      dementia, Parkinson's disease, chronic kidney disease and cancer (including 
      subtypes). In both Cohorts 1 and 2, there were no systematic statistically 
      significant differences in associations between sustained use of lithium versus 
      lamotrigine and valproate, respectively, and any physical disorder, including 
      subtypes of disorders, except myxedema, for which exposure to lithium increased 
      the absolute risk of myxedema with 7-10 % compared with lamotrigine or valproate. 
      In conclusion, these analyses emulating a target trial of "real world" 
      observational register-based data show that lithium does not increase the risk of 
      developing any kind of physical disorders, except myxedema, which may be a result 
      of detection bias.

TI  - Timing of Adjuvant Chemotherapy After Surgical Resection for Non-small Cell Lung 
      Cancer: A Target Trial Emulation Using Nationwide Swedish Registry Data.
PG  - 4650-4659
LID - 10.1245/s10434-025-17193-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the impact of time to adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) on 
      survival after surgical resection (<8 weeks or 8-16 weeks) for patients with 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by applying a target-trial emulation. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: We used Swedish population-based healthcare registries to emulate a 
      hypothetical target trial, with treatment arms of 'initiate AC <8 weeks 
      postoperatively' and 'initiate AC 8-16 weeks postoperatively'. The 
      clone-censor-weight approach was used in which all patients were cloned and all 
      clones were assigned to each treatment arm. Clones were then censored when the 
      assigned treatment was no longer compatible with the actual treatment. RESULTS: 
      We included 510 patients in the hypothetical target trial, of whom 51% received 
      AC and 150 (57%) started AC within 8 weeks. More than half of the patients were 
      female (52.5%) and the mean age was 69 years. The 5-year disease-free survival 
      (DFS) in the emulated trial for the group who initiated AC <8 weeks 
      postoperatively was 50.3% and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 58.1%. For the 
      group who initiated AC 8-16 weeks postoperatively, the emulated trial showed a 
      5-year DFS and OS of 49.1% and 57.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: By using target 
      trial emulation, our study supports earlier data on timing for AC after surgical 
      resection for NSCLC. However, further research is needed and our data indicate 
      that a randomized controlled trial could be conducted without major harm to the 
      experimental group (>8 weeks).

TI  - Designing observational studies for credible causal inference in addiction 
      research-Directed acyclic graphs, modified disjunctive cause criterion and target 
      trial emulation.
PG  - 1125-1134
LID - 10.1111/add.16442 [doi]
AB  - Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for causal 
      inference. With a sufficient sample size, randomization removes confounding up to 
      the time of randomization and allows the treatment effect to be isolated. 
      However, RCTs may have limited generalizability and transportability and are 
      often not feasible in addiction research due to ethical or logistical 
      constraints. The importance of observational studies from real-world settings has 
      been increasingly recognized in research on health. This paper provides an 
      overview of modern approaches to designing observational studies that enable 
      causal inference. It illustrates three key techniques, Directed Acyclic Graphs 
      (DAGs), modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion and Target Trial Emulation, and 
      discusses the strengths and limitations of their applications.

TI  - An Emulated Target Trial Case Study of Real-World Overall Survival With 
      Second-Line Maintenance Niraparib Versus Active Surveillance in Patients With 
      Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.
PG  - e70001
LID - 10.1002/pds.70001 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This retrospective real-world study compared overall survival (OS) 
      between patients with BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer 
      (OC) who received niraparib second-line maintenance (2LM) versus active 
      surveillance (AS) using target trial emulation, cloning, inverse probability of 
      censoring weighting (IPCW) methodology to minimize immortal time bias. METHODS: 
      Eligible patients from a United States-based, deidentified, electronic health 
      record-derived database were diagnosed with epithelial OC (January 1, 2011-May 
      31, 2021), were BRCAwt, and completed second-line (2L) therapy (January 1, 
      2017-March 2, 2022). Patient data were cloned at index (2L last treatment date), 
      assigned to niraparib 2LM and AS cohorts, and censored when treatment deviated 
      from clone assignment. Follow-up was measured from index to earliest of study end 
      (May 31, 2022), last activity, or death. Median OS (mOS) and hazard ratios were 
      estimated from stabilized IPCW Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 199 patients received niraparib 2LM, and 707 had their care 
      managed with AS. Key characteristics were balanced across cohorts after cloning 
      and stabilized IPCW. Median follow-up was 15.6- and 9.3-months pre-cloning. IPCW 
      mOS was 24.1 months (95% CI: 20.9-29.5) and 18.4 months (95% CI: 15.1-22.8) in 
      niraparib 2LM and AS cohorts, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI: 
      0.66-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study provides supportive evidence of an 
      OS benefit for patients with BRCAwt recurrent OC who received 2LM niraparib 
      monotherapy compared with those whose care was managed with AS. The analytic 
      strategies implemented were useful in minimizing immortal time bias and measured 
      confounding.

TI  - Comparing the impact of targeting limited driving pressure to low tidal volume 
      ventilation on mortality in mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 ARDS: an 
      exploratory target trial emulation.
LID - 10.1136/bmjresp-2024-002439 [doi]
LID - e002439
AB  - BACKGROUND: An association between driving pressure (∆P) and the outcomes of 
      invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) may exist. However, the effect of a 
      sustained limitation of ∆P on mortality in patients with acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome (ARDS), including patients with COVID-19 (COVID-19-related 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS)) undergoing IMV, has not been 
      rigorously evaluated. The use of emulations of a target trial in intensive care 
      unit research remains in its infancy. To inform future, large ARDS target trials, 
      we explored using a target trial emulation approach to analyse data from a cohort 
      of IMV adults with C-ARDS to determine whether maintaining daily ∆p<15 cm H(2)O 
      (in addition to traditional low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) (tidal volume 
      5-7 cc/PBW+plateau pressure (P(plat)) ≤30 cm H(2)O), compared with LTVV alone, 
      affects the 28-day mortality. METHODS: To emulate a target trial, adults with 
      C-ARDS requiring >24 hours of IMV were considered to be assigned to limited ∆P or 
      LTVV. Lung mechanics were measured twice daily after ventilator setting 
      adjustments were made. To evaluate the effect of each lung-protective ventilation 
      (LPV) strategy on the 28-day mortality, we fit a stabilised inverse probability 
      weighted marginal structural model that adjusted for baseline and time-varying 
      confounders known to affect protection strategy use/adherence or survival. 
      RESULTS: Among the 92 patients included, 27 (29.3%) followed limited ∆P 
      ventilation, 23 (25.0%) the LTVV strategy and 42 (45.7%) received no LPV 
      strategy. The adjusted estimated 28-day survival was 47.0% (95% CI 23%, 76%) in 
      the limited ∆P group, 70.3% in the LTVV group (95% CI 37.6%, 100%) and 37.6% (95% 
      CI 20.8%, 58.0%) in the no LPV strategy group. INTERPRETATION: Limiting ∆P may 
      not provide additional survival benefits for patients with C-ARDS over LTVV. Our 
      results help inform the development of future target trial emulations focused on 
      evaluating LPV strategies, including reduced ∆P, in adults with ARDS.

TI  - The Use of the Target Trial Approach in Perinatal Pharmacoepidemiology: A Scoping 
      Review Protocol.

AB  - Background: Pregnant and postpartum women have been historically excluded from 
      clinical trials, with data on the safety of drugs relying on observational 
      research. Methodological concerns regarding the timing and dosing of medications, 
      data sources, study designs, and methods used for estimating associations are 
      still problematic in observational studies. Answering causal questions is even 
      more complex. Despite the increased interest in emulating target trials using 
      observational data, little is known about this approach in perinatal 
      pharmacoepidemiology. Objective: This scoping review protocol aims to describe 
      the methodology for assessing the available literature concerning emulating 
      target trials for studying outcomes in women exposed to medications in the 
      preconception, perinatal, or postpartum periods. Methods and Analysis: We will 
      follow the methods detailed in the Joanna Briggs Institute reviewer's manual. We 
      will adopt the six-stage framework recommended by Arksey and O'Malley and Levac 
      and others. Web scraping techniques will be used for identifying relevant 
      studies. Two authors will select articles based on the title and abstract, with 
      discrepancies resolved by consensus, by a third reviewer. Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews flow 
      diagram will be presented to reflect the search process. We will use existing 
      statements to identify quality gaps in the current literature. Variables related 
      to the content for perinatal pharmacoepidemiologic research will be included. The 
      Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) will guide 
      the assessment of the target trial emulation (i.e., treatment strategies 
      compared, assignment procedures, follow-up period, outcome, and causal 
      contrasts). Discussion: Data regarding the safety of drugs taken, prior to and 
      during pregnancy and while lactating are lacking and it is necessary to 
      understand how we can answer these questions using rigorous methods in 
      observational research. Through this scoping review, we intend to understand to 
      what extent the target trial approach is being used in perinatal 
      pharmacoepidemiology and provide recommendations to improve its use in this 
      field. Ethics and Dissemination: Secondary data from published scientific 
      articles will be used, not requiring approval by the Research Ethics Committee 
      with human beings. Findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Effectiveness of Xuanshen Yishen Decoction on Intensive Blood Pressure Control: 
      Emulation of a Randomized Target Trial Using Real-World Data.
LID - 10.1007/s11655-025-4007-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of Xuanshen Yishen Decoction (XYD) in 
      the treatment of hypertension. METHODS: Hospital electronic medical records from 
      2019-2023 were utilized to emulate a randomized pragmatic clinical trial. 
      Hypertensive participants were eligible if they were aged ⩾40 years with baseline 
      systolic blood pressure (BP) ⩾140 mm Hg. Patients treated with XYD plus 
      antihypertensive regimen were assigned to the treatment group, whereas those who 
      followed only antihypertensive regimen were assigned to the control group. The 
      primary outcome assessed was the attainment rate of intensive BP control at 
      discharge, with the secondary outcome focusing on the 6-month all-cause 
      readmission rate. RESULTS: The study included 3,302 patients, comprising 2,943 
      individuals in the control group and 359 in the treatment group. Compared with 
      the control group, a higher proportion in the treatment group achieved the target 
      BP for intensive BP control [8.09% vs. 17.5%; odds ratio (OR)=2.29, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI)=1.68 to 3.13; P<0.001], particularly in individuals with 
      high homocysteine levels (OR=3.13; 95% CI=1.72 to 5.71; P<0.001; P for 
      interaction=0.041). Furthermore, the 6-month all-cause readmission rate in the 
      treatment group was lower than in the control group (hazard ratio=0.58; 95% 
      CI=0.36 to 0.91; P=0.019), and the robustness of the results was confirmed by 
      sensitivity analyse. CONCLUSIONS: XYD could be a complementary therapy for 
      intensive BP control. Our study offers real-world evidence and guides the choice 
      of complementary and alternative therapies. (Registration No. ChiCTR2400086589).

TI  - Effect of caesarean birth on perinatal mortality for singleton breech 
      presentation in spontaneous preterm labour-A target trial emulation using 
      Scottish health record data.
PG  - e0326001
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0326001 [doi]
LID - e0326001
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of mode of birth for women in preterm breech labour could 
      not be successfully determined in randomised trials. We aimed to explore the 
      effect of caesarean birth on perinatal mortality for women in spontaneous-onset 
      preterm labour with a singleton baby presenting breech through target trial 
      emulation. METHODS: A target trial emulation of a parallel group randomised 
      controlled trial using routinely collected Scottish electronic health record data 
      was performed. Participants were pregnant women at 24-36 gestational weeks with a 
      singleton breech baby, no prior caesarean birth, in spontaneous labour with a 
      live baby at labour onset (1 January 1997 to 31 December 2019). We compared 
      caesarean birth (intervention) to vaginal breech birth (control) in a 
      per-protocol analysis (actual mode of birth). The primary outcome was extended 
      perinatal mortality (intrapartum stillbirths and neonatal deaths). A multiple 
      logistic regression model with inverse probability weight was used to adjust for 
      measured confounders. There were 2,092 caesarean births and 967 vaginal breech 
      births. In the emulated trial, caesarean birth reduced extended perinatal 
      mortality compared to vaginal breech birth (odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.43). At 24 weeks' gestation, caesarean birth decreased 
      the odds of perinatal death by 47.7% (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.78). At 36 
      gestational weeks it was associated with an 82.1% reduction in the odds of 
      perinatal death (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.32). As the risk of perinatal 
      mortality is inversely correlated with gestational age at birth, seven and 88 
      caesarean births were needed to prevent one perinatal death at 24 weeks and 36 
      weeks' gestation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Caesarean birth was associated with 
      a reduced risk of extended perinatal mortality in spontaneous preterm singleton 
      breech labour in a per-protocol trial emulation. Observational data that 
      accurately captures planned mode of birth and unmeasured confounders such as 
      breech subtype is required to emulate an intention-to-treat analysis.

      we constructed a cohort of patients aged ≥40 years who were dispensed SGLT2 
      inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or biguanides between April 
      2014 and March 2015. For computational ease, we randomly sampled 100% of SGLT2 
      inhibitor users, 3% of DPP-4 inhibitor users, and 20% of biguanide users; new 
      antidiabetic drug initiators were analysed. We estimated the intention-to-treat 
      (ITT) hazard ratios (HRs) of UTI with inverse probability of treatment 
      (IPT)-weighted Cox's proportional hazards models that ignored subsequent 
      treatment changes. Treatment weights were computed using patient sex, age, 
      medications, medical history and hospitalization history. We also estimated 
      per-protocol (PP) HRs using IPT- and inverse probability of censoring-weighted 
      Cox's models that adjusted for nonrandom treatment changes. RESULTS: We analysed 
      11 364 SGLT2 inhibitor initiators, 9035 DPP-4 inhibitor initiators, and 10 359 
      biguanide initiators. When compared with biguanide initiators, SGLT2 inhibitor 
      initiators had a crude HR of 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.24), an 
      ITT HR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.86-1.03), and a PP HR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.78-1.03); and 
      DPP-4 inhibitor initiators had a crude HR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23), an ITT HR 
      of 0.85 (95% CI 0.77-0.94), and a PP HR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.71-0.95). CONCLUSION: 
      Use of SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors did not increase the risk of UTI 
      compared with biguanide use. Accounting for treatment changes did not 
      substantially influence the estimated effects.

TI  - Psoriasis Risk With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.
PG  - 31-38
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2024.4129 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are recognized as revolutionary 
      cancer therapies but have raised concerns about immune-related adverse events, 
      including the development of autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      psoriasis risk associated with the use of ICIs in patients with cancer. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study with a target trial 
      emulation design used data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database and 
      the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The participants included were patients who received 
      antineoplastic medications for cancer at stages III and IV between January 1, 
      2019, and June 30, 2021. Data were analyzed from May 2023 to July 2024. 
      EXPOSURES: Patients treated with ICIs were classified as ICI users, while those 
      who received chemotherapy or targeted therapies were categorized as non-ICI 
      users. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of 
      psoriasis during the follow-up period. Stabilized inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to mitigate potential confounders. Cox and 
      Fine-Gray hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for psoriasis 
      risk between groups. RESULTS: Of 135 230 patients who received antineoplastic 
      medications (mean [SD] age, 62.94 [13.01] years; 45.1% female), 3188 patients 
      were eligible for the ICI user group, while 132 042 patients were eligible for 
      the non-ICI user group. ICI users experienced a higher incidence of psoriasis at 
      5.76 cases per 1000 person-years, compared to 1.44 cases in the non-ICI group. 
      After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, ICI users were found to have 
      a 2-fold increase in the risk of developing psoriasis (IPTW-adjusted HR, 3.31; 
      IPTW-adjusted subdistribution HR, 2.43). Both as-started design and on-treatment 
      design showed consistent findings, and the results were consistent and robust 
      across all follow-up intervals and all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, patients with cancer treated with ICIs faced an 
      increased risk of psoriasis. Medical professionals should be aware of the 
      potential adverse effects of immunotherapy to ensure optimal cancer care.

TI  - Emulating a target trial of proton pump inhibitors and dementia risk using claims 
      data.
PG  - 1335-1343
LID - 10.1111/ene.15284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Understanding the adverse effects of proton pump 
      inhibitors (PPIs) is important due to their widespread use, but the available 
      evidence for an increased dementia risk amongst patients taking PPIs is 
      inconclusive. The present study aimed to estimate the causal effect of PPIs on 
      the risk of dementia by target trial emulation and time-varying exposure 
      modeling. METHODS: Using claims data of 2,698,176 insured people of a large 
      German statutory health insurer, a target trial was conceptualized in which 
      individuals aged 40 years and older were classified as PPI initiators or 
      non-initiators between 2008 and 2018, and were followed until diagnosis of 
      dementia, death, loss to follow-up or end of study. Incidence of dementia 
      (International Classification of Diseases 10 codes F00, F01, F03, F05.1, G30, 
      G31.0, G31.1, G31.9 and F02.8+G31.82) was defined applying a 1-year lag window. 
      Weighted Cox models were used to estimate the effect of PPI initiation versus 
      non-initiation on dementia risk and weighted pooled logistic regression was used 
      to estimate the effect of time-varying use versus non-use. RESULTS: In all, 
      29,746 PPI initiators (4.4%) and 26,830 non-initiators (1.3%) were diagnosed with 
      dementia. Comparing PPI initiation with no initiation, the hazard ratio for 
      dementia was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.51-1.58). The hazard ratio for 
      time-dependent PPI use versus non-use was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 
      1.50-1.63). Differentiated subtypes, including unspecified dementia, Alzheimer's 
      disease and vascular dementia, showed increased risk by PPI initiation and 
      time-varying PPI use. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that PPI initiation and 
      time-varying PPI use may increase overall dementia risk.

TI  - Impact on Survival of Early Versus Late Initiation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy After 
      Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Surgery: A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 1310-1318
LID - 10.1245/s10434-023-14497-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the impact of early (0-4 weeks after discharge) versus 
      late (> 4-8 weeks after discharge) initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy on 
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma survival. METHODS: We used Danish population-based 
      healthcare registries to emulate a hypothetical target trial using the 
      clone-censor-weight approach. All eligible patients were cloned with one clone 
      assigned to 'early initiation' and one clone assigned to 'late initiation'. 
      Clones were censored when the assigned treatment was no longer compatible with 
      the actual treatment. Informative censoring was addressed using inverse 
      probability of censoring weighting. RESULTS: We included 1491 patients in a 
      hypothetical target trial, of whom 32.3% initiated chemotherapy within 0-4 weeks 
      and 38.3% between > 4 and 8 weeks after discharge for pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
      surgery; 206 (13.8%) initiated chemotherapy after > 8 weeks, and 232 (15.6%) did 
      not initiate chemotherapy. Median overall survival was 30.4 and 29.9 months in 
      late and early initiators, respectively. The absolute differences in OS, 
      comparing late with early initiators, were 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      - 1.5%, 7.9%), - 0.7% (95% CI - 7.2%, 5.8%), and 3.2% (95% CI - 2.8%, 9.3%) at 1, 
      3, and 5 years, respectively. Late initiators had a higher increase in albumin 
      levels as well as higher pretreatment albumin values. CONCLUSIONS: Postponement 
      of adjuvant chemotherapy up to 8 weeks after discharge from pancreatic 
      adenocarcinoma surgery is safe and may allow more patients to receive adjuvant 
      therapy due to better recovery.

TI  - GLP-1RA Use and Thyroid Cancer Risk.
PG  - 243-252

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The increasing use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RA) demands a better understanding of their association with thyroid 
      cancer. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of incident thyroid cancer among adults 
      with type 2 diabetes being treated with GLP-1RA vs other common glucose-lowering 
      medications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prespecified secondary 
      analysis of a target trial emulation of a comparative effectiveness study using 
      claims data for enrollees in commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare 
      fee-for-service plans across the US. Eligible participants were adults with type 
      2 diabetes at moderate risk for cardiovascular disease and without history of 
      thyroid cancer who had newly filled prescriptions for GLP-1RA, sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i), or 
      sulfonylurea from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed 
      February 1 to October 31, 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall and piecewise 
      (<1, 1-2, and ≥2 years since treatment initiation) hazard ratios (HRs) for 
      thyroid cancer with use of GLP-1RA vs the other 3 drug classes were estimated 
      using inverse propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Modified 
      intention-to-treat (mITT) (primary) and as-treated (sensitivity) analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: Of 351 913 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [8.5] years; 173 391 
      [49.3%] females and 178 522 [50.7%] males), 41 112 started treatment with 
      GLP-1RA; 76 093, with DPP4i; 43 499, with SGLT2i; and 191 209, with sulfonylurea 
      therapy. The numbers of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer were 69 (0.17%) in 
      the GLP-1RA group, 172 (0.23%) in the DPP4i group, 72 (0.17%) in the SGLT2i 
      group, and 381 (0.20%) in the sulfonylurea group. In the mITT analysis, GLP-1RA 
      initiation was not significantly associated with increased overall risk for 
      thyroid cancer compared to the other 3 diabetes drugs (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 
      0.88-1.76). However, the risk for thyroid cancer was significantly higher within 
      the first year after GLP-1RA initiation (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11-3.08) and was 
      amplified in the overall as-treated analysis that censored patients when therapy 
      was discontinued or another medication was added (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.10-3.95). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This secondary analysis of a target trial emulation of 
      a comparative effectiveness study found that despite the low absolute risk of 
      thyroid cancer among patients receiving GLP-1RA therapy, there was an increased 
      risk of new thyroid cancer diagnoses within the first year of GLP-1RA initiation 
      compared to 3 other diabetes drugs. This finding may have been due to enhanced 
      early detection; therefore, further research is necessary to understand the 
      underlying causes of this association.

TI  - Review of the target trial methodological approach on treatment effect estimates 
      in kidney failure: protocol for a systematic assessment.
PG  - 280
LID - 10.1186/s13643-024-02672-4 [doi]
LID - 280
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with kidney failure often lack robust evidence because they 
      are excluded from randomized trials. Trial emulation provides an alternative 
      approach to derive treatment effect estimates when randomized trials cannot be 
      conducted. Critical questions about the comparative efficacy and safety of 
      interventions in kidney failure are now being answered using this approach or 
      parts of it. However, variations and inconsistencies in reporting cast doubt on 
      the reliability and validity of effect estimates not derived from randomized 
      trials. The aim of this methodological systematic review is to understand the 
      extent to which the target study approach is used in kidney failure and the 
      appropriateness of this approach. By identifying and evaluating studies that 
      qualify as emulating a target trial, compared with studies that did not apply the 
      principles. We aim to provide more specific methodological guidance to increase 
      the clarity and reliability of reporting treatment effect estimates when running 
      a trial in kidney failure is not feasible. METHODS: This protocol is developed in 
      accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. MEDLINE, Embase, and reference 
      lists (backwards citation chasing) will be searched up until 1st July 2023 and 
      the search updated prior to publication to identify all studies evaluating 
      patient outcomes in late-stage kidney disease and failure that use target trial 
      emulation as the primary approach for analysis. Two authors (A. A., P. K.) will 
      select articles based on title and abstract and then full text, with a third 
      reviewer settling disagreements (J. P.). The prespecified variables will be 
      extracted, and the risk of bias will be assessed by at least two authors (A. A., 
      P. K., A. N.) using prespecified data forms. This will enable the determination 
      of the robustness of the methodological quality of observational studies in using 
      the whole or elements of the target trial approach. We will thereby assess their 
      ability to reliably report treatment effect estimates. DISCUSSION: We will 
      provide specific methodological recommendations on how to design target trials 
      and model assumptions for emulation to get reliable treatment effect estimates 
      for therapeutic interventions in kidney failure. METHODOLOGICAL SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of primary tumor resection versus chemotherapy in 
      patients with asymptomatic unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: a 
      retrospective cohort study using the target trial emulation framework.
PG  - 2172-2186
LID - 10.62347/UGXA9515 [doi]
AB  - Patients who undergo primary tumor resection (PTR) reportedly have significantly 
      higher overall survival (OS) than those who do not undergo this procedure. 
      However, this result is only evident in past retrospective studies, and clinical 
      trial results did not show the same trend. Thus, it remains unclear whether 
      primary tumor resection effectively increases survival in patients with 
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) across different study designs. We compared 
      the OS of patients with asymptomatic unresectable mCRC who underwent PTR with 
      that of those who did not. This retrospective cohort study was designed to be a 
      target trial emulation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that would have 
      compared the effectiveness of PTR versus non-PTR in patients with asymptomatic 
      unresectable mCRC from 2009 to 2017. A systematic review and meta-analysis were 
      conducted to compare the efficacy of PTR and non-PTR in patients with mCRC, and 
      corresponding results were compared. This cohort included 1,132 patients for a 
      per-protocol analysis. The PTR group had non-significantly longer survival 
      (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.62-1.01) than the 
      non-PTR group in our cohort. A meta-analysis including five RCTs (1,016 patients) 
      and our cohort found that the PTR group did not have a significantly lower 
      mortality rate than the non-PTR group. The results of this cohort study and 
      previous RCTs suggest that PTR is not associated with improved survival compared 
      to systemic chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy among asymptomatic 
      unresectable mCRC patients. Therefore, routine PTR is not recommended in these 
      patients.

TI  - Trial emulation and survival analysis for disease incidence registers: A case 
      study on the causal effect of pre-emptive kidney transplantation.
PG  - 4176-4199
LID - 10.1002/sim.9503 [doi]
AB  - When drawing causal inference from observed data, failure time outcomes present 
      additional challenges of censoring often combined with other missing data 
      patterns. In this article, we follow incident cases of end-stage renal disease to 
      examine the effect on all-cause mortality of starting treatment with transplant, 
      so-called pre-emptive kidney transplantation, vs starting with dialysis possibly 
      followed by delayed transplantation. The question is relatively simple: which 
      start-off treatment is expected to bring the best survival for a target 
      population? To address it, we emulate a target trial drawing on the long term 
      Swedish Renal Registry, where a growing common set of baseline covariates was 
      measured nationwide. Several lessons are learned which pertain to long term 
      disease registers more generally. With characteristics of cases and versions of 
      treatment evolving over time, informative censoring is already introduced in 
      unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves. This leads to misrepresented survival chances in 
      observed treatment groups. The resulting biased treatment association may be 
      aggravated upon implementing IPW for treatment. Aware of additional challenges, 
      we further recall how similar studies to date have selected patients into 
      treatment groups based on events occurring post treatment initiation. Our study 
      reveals the dramatic impact of resulting immortal time bias combined with other 
      typical features of long-term incident disease registers, including missing 
      covariates during the early phases of the register. We discuss feasible ways of 
      accommodating these features when targeting relevant estimands, and demonstrate 
      how more than one causal question can be answered relying on the no unmeasured 
      baseline confounders assumption.

TI  - Association of early statin initiation during COVID-19 admission with inpatient 
      mortality at an academic health system in Illinois, March 2020 to September 2022: 
      a target trial emulation using observational data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the association of early statin initiation with inpatient 
      mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This observational study emulated a hypothetical target trial using electronic 
      health records data from Northwestern Medicine Health System, Illinois, 
      2020-2022. We included patients who were ≥40 years, admitted ≥48 hours for 
      COVID-19 from March 2020 to August 2022 and had no evidence of statin use before 
      admission. INTERVENTIONS: Individuals who initiated any statins within 48 hours 
      of admission were compared with individuals who did not initiate statins during 
      this period. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Inpatient mortality at hospital days 7, 
      14, 21 and 28 were determined using hospital records. Risk differences between 
      exposure groups were calculated using augmented inverse propensity weighting 
      (AIPW) with SuperLearner. RESULTS: A total of 8893 individuals (24.5% early 
      statin initiators) were included. Early initiators tended to be older, male and 
      have higher comorbidity burdens. Unadjusted day 28 mortality was higher in early 
      initiators (6.0% vs 3.6%). Adjusted analysis showed slightly higher inpatient 
      mortality risk at days 7 (RD: 0.5%, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.8) and 21 (RD: 0.6%, 95% CI: 
      0.04 to 1.1), but not days 14 (RD: 0.4%, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.9) and 28 (RD: 0.4%, 
      95% CI: -0.2 to 1.1). Sensitivity analyses using alternative modelling approaches 
      showed no difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Early statin initiation was not 
      associated with lower mortality contrasting with findings of previous 
      observational studies. Trial emulation helped in identifying and addressing 
      sources of bias incompletely addressed by previous work. Statin use may be 
      indicated for other conditions but not COVID-19.

TI  - Association of perioperative initiation of gabapentin versus pregabalin with 
      kidney function: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 1488773

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are opioid 
      substitutes commonly included in perioperative multimodal analgesia regimens. We 
      investigated whether the initiation of gabapentin and pregabalin during the 
      perioperative period have varying effects on the adverse renal outcomes. METHODS: 
      This study included adult participants who received surgery in the INSPIRE 
      database. The exposure of interest was the initiation of pregabalin or gabapentin 
      during the perioperative period. The primary outcome was renal function decline. 
      Secondary outcomes included incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI), and in-hospital mortality. We 
      conducted a propensity score to balance the baseline characteristics. Cox 
      proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of the 
      initiation of gabapentin compared with pregabalin. RESULTS: Among 640 pairs of 
      pregabalin and gabapentin initiators in the matched cohort, the initiation of 
      gabapentin was associated with a higher risk of kidney function decline (HR, 
      1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.89) as compared with pregabalin. After 
      excluding participants who were diagnosed with CKD at the baseline, the 
      initiation of gabapentin was associated with a higher risk of incident CKD (HR, 
      1.46; 95% CI, 1.03-2.05) as compared with pregabalin. For the in-hospital 
      outcomes, the proportion of AKI and mortality were similar between participants 
      initiating gabapentin and pregabalin. In addition, the risk of kidney function 
      decline did not vary across each subgroup. CONCLUSION: The initiation of 
      gabapentin during the perioperative period was associated with a higher risk of 
      kidney function decline and incident CKD as compared with pregabalin.

TI  - Association Between Coronary Assessment in Heart Failure and Clinical Outcomes 
      Within a Safety-Net Setting Using a Target Trial Emulation Observational Design.
PG  - e010800
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.123.010800 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ischemic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of heart failure (HF). 
      Most patients do not undergo coronary assessment after HF diagnosis. There are no 
      randomized clinical trials of coronary assessment after HF diagnosis. METHODS: 
      Using an electronic health record cohort of all individuals with HF within the 
      San Francisco Health Network from 2001 to 2019, we identified factors associated 
      with coronary assessment. Then, we studied the association of coronary assessment 
      within 30 days of HF diagnosis with all-cause mortality and a composite of 
      mortality and emergent angiography using a target trial emulation observational 
      comparative-effectiveness approach. Target trial emulation is an approach to 
      causal inference based on creating a hypothetical randomized clinical trial 
      protocol and using observational data to emulate the protocol. We used propensity 
      scores for covariate adjustment. We used national death records to improve the 
      ascertainment of mortality and included falsification end points for the cause of 
      death. RESULTS: Among 14 829 individuals with HF (median, 62 years old; 5855 
      [40%] women), 3987 (26.9%) ever completed coronary assessment, with 2467/13 301 
      (18.5%) with unknown coronary artery disease status at HF diagnosis assessed. 
      Women, older individuals, and people without stable housing were less likely to 
      complete coronary assessment. Among 5972 eligible persons of whom 627 underwent 
      early elective coronary assessment, coronary assessment was associated with lower 
      mortality (hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.72-0.97]; P=0.025), reduced risk of the 
      composite outcome (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.73-1.00]), higher rates of 
      revascularization (odds ratio, 7.6 [95% CI, 5.4-10.6]), and higher use of medical 
      therapy (odds ratio, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]), but not the falsification end 
      points. CONCLUSIONS: In a safety-net population, disparities in coronary 
      assessment after HF diagnosis are not fully explained by coronary artery disease 
      risk factors. Early coronary assessment is associated with improved HF outcomes 
      possibly related to higher rates of revascularization and guideline-directed 
      medical therapy but with low certainty that this finding is not attributable to 
      unmeasured confounding.

AB  - Due to dependent happenings, vaccines can have different effects in populations. 
      In addition to direct protective effects in the vaccinated, vaccination in a 
      population can have indirect effects in the unvaccinated individuals. Vaccination 
      can also reduce person-to-person transmission to vaccinated individuals or from 
      vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated individuals. Design of vaccine 
      studies has a history extending back over a century. Emerging infectious 
      diseases, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, 
      have stimulated new interest in vaccine studies. We focus on some recent 
      developments, such as target trial emulation, test-negative design, and 
      regression discontinuity design. Methods for evaluating durability of vaccine 
      effects were developed in the context of both blinded and unblinded placebo 
      crossover studies. The case-ascertained design is used to assess the transmission 
      effects of vaccines. The novel ring vaccination trial design was first used in 
      the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

TI  - Physical activity across midlife and health-related quality of life in Australian 
      women: A target trial emulation using a longitudinal cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little long-term causal evidence on the effect of physical 
      activity on health-related quality of life. This study aimed to examine the 
      associations between longitudinal patterns of physical activity over 15 years and 
      health-related quality of life in both the physical and mental health domains, in 
      a cohort of middle-aged Australian women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data 
      collected at 3-year intervals (1998 to 2019) from 11,336 participants in the 
      Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) (1946 to 1951 birth 
      cohort). Primary outcomes were the physical (PCS) and mental health component 
      summary (MCS) scores (range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate higher 
      perceived physical/mental health) from the SF-36 in 2019 (when women aged 68 to 
      73 years). Using target trial emulation to imitate a randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT), we tested 2 interventions: (1) meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      physical activity guidelines consistently throughout the 15-year "exposure 
      period" (2001 to 2016; when women aged 50-55 to 65-70 years; physical activity 
      assessed every 3 years); and (2) not meeting the guidelines at the beginning of 
      the exposure period but starting to first meet the guidelines at age 55, 60, or 
      65; against the control of not meeting the guidelines throughout the exposure 
      period. Analysis controlled for confounding using marginal structural models 
      which were adjusted for sociodemographic and health variables and conditions. 
      Consistent adherence to guidelines during the exposure period (PCS: 46.93 [99.5% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 46.32, 47.54]) and first starting to meet the 
      guidelines at age 55 (PCS: 46.96 [99.5% CI: 45.53, 48.40]) were associated with 
      three-point higher PCS (mean score difference: 3.0 [99.5% CI: 1.8, 4.1] and 3.0 
      [99.5% CI:1.2, 4.8]) than consistent non-adherence (PCS: 43.90 [99.5% CI: 42.79, 
      45.01]). We found a similar pattern for most SF-36 subscales but no significant 
      effects of the interventions on MCS. The main limitations of the study were that 
      it may not account for all underlying health conditions and/or other unmeasured 
      or insufficiently measured confounders, the use of self-reported physical 
      activity and that findings may not be generalizable to all mid-age women. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results from the emulated RCT suggest women should be active 
      throughout mid-age, ideally increasing activity levels to meet the guidelines by 
      age 55, to gain the most benefits for physical health in later life.

AB  - The preferred approach to compare two treatments is a randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT). Indeed, randomization ensures that the groups compared are similar. 
      Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs thus allow to draw causal conclusions on 
      the relative efficacy and safety of treatments compared. However, it is not 
      always possible to conduct RCTs for all clinical questions of interest, and 
      observational data may also be used to infer on the relative effectiveness of 
      treatments. In this review, we present different approaches that allow 
      statistically valid comparisons of the effectiveness of treatments using 
      observational data under some assumptions. Those are based on regression 
      modelling or the propensity score. We also present the principles of target trial 
      emulation.

TI  - A Post-Authorisation Safety Study of a Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine in 
      Pregnant Women and Their Offspring in a Real-World Setting: Generic Protocol for 
      a Target Trial Emulation.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13030272 [doi]
LID - 272
AB  - Background: Assessing the real-world safety of preventive products against 
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in pregnant women holds significant public 
      health implications, especially as vaccination programs become more widespread. 
      This generic protocol describes a post-authorisation safety study (PASS) to 
      evaluate the safety of RSV vaccination in pregnant women using a target trial 
      emulation framework. Methods: This generic protocol, adapted from an ongoing 
      PASS, is designed using the target trial emulation framework to evaluate the 
      safety of an RSV vaccine in pregnant women. Emulating target trial conditions 
      have the ability to minimise confounding and bias. In this pragmatic real-world 
      observational study, RSV-vaccinated pregnant women are matched (1:N) with 
      unexposed women based on gestational age, calendar time, maternal age, 
      immunocompromised status, and high-risk pregnancy. Key adverse outcomes include 
      preterm birth, stillbirth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, Guillain-Barré 
      Syndrome (GBS), low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA). 
      Future studies may add additional outcomes per vaccine risk profile and Global 
      Alignment of Immunization safety Assessment (GAIA) recommendations. 
      Distinguishing outcomes measured during pregnancy from those assessed at or after 
      birth is crucial for analysis and interpretation. Conclusions: This protocol 
      offers a structured approach to evaluating the safety of RSV vaccines in pregnant 
      women. It aims to guide researchers in designing studies and should be adapted to 
      specific settings and data availability.

TI  - A Trial Emulation Approach for Policy Evaluations with Group-level Longitudinal 
      Data.
PG  - 533-540
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001369 [doi]
AB  - To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world 
      implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home 
      orders. Numerous studies aim to estimate the effects of these policies. Many 
      statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage 
      repeated measurements, and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, 
      including in the COVID-19 context. Although these methods are less common in 
      epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar 
      complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. Target trial emulation 
      emphasizes the need to carefully design a nonexperimental study in terms of 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome 
      measurement-and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations 
      using group-level longitudinal ("panel") data need to take a similar careful 
      approach to study design that we refer to as policy trial emulation. This 
      approach is especially important when intervention timing varies across 
      jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each 
      treatment cohort (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then 
      aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level 
      stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from 
      panel methods-with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics-can help 
      add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging.

TI  - Comparing the effectiveness of different vaccines in individuals with and without 
      autoimmune diseases: a study protocol for a target trial emulation.

AB  - AIM: This article presents the study protocol of a retrospective cohort study 
      designed to compare the effectiveness of herpes zoster, and influenza vaccines in 
      individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic inflammatory bowel diseases 
      (IBD), or chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRD) to individuals without 
      these diseases, using claims data of one of the largest population based health 
      insurances in Germany. BACKGROUND: Individuals with autoimmune diseases such as 
      MS, IBD, and CIRD are more susceptible to vaccine preventable infectious diseases 
      such as influenza and herpes zoster, due to the autoimmune disease itself, the 
      presence of comorbidities and immunosuppressive therapies. Vaccines are the 
      primary means to prevent such diseases. The efficacy of these vaccines is usually 
      estimated using large randomized controlled trials, from which patients with MS, 
      IBD, and CIRD are often excluded. It is therefore unclear whether these vaccines 
      are also effective for these patients. DESIGN: A target trial emulation based on 
      observational claims data of a statutory health insurance company is proposed. 
      METHODS: This study will aim to emulate multiple target trials to compare the 
      effectiveness of herpes zoster and influenza vaccines in patients with and 
      without MS, IBD and CIRD using data from a large German statutory health 
      insurance provider (BARMER). The primary outcome for each vaccine effectiveness 
      analysis is the disease itself. The analysis will be carried out using both 
      time-dependent matching and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model in 
      conjunction with g-computation. Additionally, the moderating effect of 
      immunosuppressive therapies on the vaccine effectiveness will be estimated using 
      a stratified secondary analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will estimate and compare 
      the effectiveness of influenza and herpes zoster vaccines in individuals with and 
      without MS, IBD, and CIRD. Because of the large amount of data, this study will 
      also be able to investigate the role of the immunosuppressive medication on 
      vaccine effectiveness, which may provide guidance for vaccine administration 
      guidelines.

TI  - Effectiveness of post-COVID-19 primary care attendance in improving survival in 
      very old patients with multimorbidity: a territory-wide target trial emulation.
LID - bjgp24X737517 [pii]
LID - 10.3399/bjgp24X737517 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults with multimorbidity are at high risk of mortality 
      following COVID-19 hospitalisation. However, the potential benefit of timely 
      primary care follow-up on severe outcomes post-COVID-19 has not been well 
      established. AIM: To examine the effectiveness of attending general outpatient 
      within 30 days after discharge from COVID-19 on 1-year survival among older 
      adults aged ≥85 years, with multimorbidity. METHOD: We emulated a target trial 
      using a comprehensive public healthcare database in Hong Kong. The 
      cloning-censoring-weighting technique was used to minimise immortal time bias and 
      confounding bias by adjusting for demographics, hospitalisation duration and ICU 
      admission, baseline chronic conditions, and medication history. The outcome 
      included all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Of 6183 eligible 
      COVID-19 survivors, the all-cause mortality rate following COVID-19 
      hospitalisation was lower in general out-patient clinics (GOPC) group compared to 
      non-GOPC group (17.1 versus 42.8 deaths per 100 person-year). After adjustment, 
      primary care consultations within 30 days after discharge were associated with a 
      significantly greater 1-year survival (difference in 1-year survival: 11.2%, 95% 
      CI = 8.1% to 14.4%). We also observed better survival from respiratory diseases 
      in the GOPC group. In a sensitivity analysis for different grace period lengths, 
      we found that the earlier participants had a GOPC visit after COVID-19 discharge, 
      the better the survival. CONCLUSION: Timely primary care consultations after 
      discharge may improve survival following COVID-19 hospitalisation among older 
      adults aged ≥85 years, with multimorbidity. Expanding primary care services and 
      implementing follow-up mechanisms are crucial to support this vulnerable 
      population's recovery and well-being.

TI  - Personalized Timing for Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation in Hematologic 
      Neoplasms: A Target Trial Emulation Approach Using Multistate Modeling and 
      Microsimulation.
PG  - e2300205
LID - 10.1200/CCI.23.00205 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Decision about the optimal timing of a treatment procedure in patients 
      with hematologic neoplasms is critical, especially for cellular therapies (most 
      including allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation [HSCT]). In the 
      absence of evidence from randomized trials, real-world observational data become 
      beneficial to study the effect of the treatment timing. In this study, a 
      framework to estimate the expected outcome after an intervention in a 
      time-to-event scenario is developed, with the aim of optimizing the timing in a 
      personalized manner. METHODS: Retrospective real-world data are leveraged to 
      emulate a target trial for treatment timing using multistate modeling and 
      microsimulation. This case study focuses on myelodysplastic syndromes, serving as 
      a prototype for rare cancers characterized by a heterogeneous clinical course and 
      complex genomic background. A cohort of 7,118 patients treated according to 
      conventional available treatments/evidence across Europe and United States is 
      analyzed. The primary clinical objective is to determine the ideal timing for 
      HSCT, the only curative option for these patients. RESULTS: This analysis enabled 
      us to identify the most appropriate time frames for HSCT on the basis of each 
      patient's unique profile, defined by a combination relevant patients' 
      characteristics. CONCLUSION: The developed methodology offers a structured 
      framework to address a relevant clinical issue in the field of hematology. It 
      makes several valuable contributions: (1) novel insights into how to develop 
      decision models to identify the most favorable HSCT timing, (2) evidence to 
      inform clinical decisions in a real-world context, and (3) the incorporation of 
      complex information into decision making. This framework can be applied to 
      provide medical insights for clinical issues that cannot be adequately addressed 
      through randomized clinical trials.

TI  - The association of economic difficulties with social and health care costs of 
      children-target trial emulation using complete birth cohort data in Finland.

AB  - It is unclear how much costs economic difficulties in families with children 
      incur to the health and social care sector. We examined the health and social 
      service costs after families entered into, and transitioned out of, social 
      assistance used as a proxy measure for economic difficulties. We analyzed 
      register data on all Finnish children born in 1997 and used the non-randomized 
      target trial framework. The two target trials of entry to economic difficulties 
      (social assistance) and continued economic difficulties included 697 680 and 
      71 131 children-year observations, respectively, in total. Inverse probability 
      treatment weighting techniques were used to make the comparison group similar to 
      the treatment group in terms of health, socioeconomic and demographic-related 
      pretreatment variables. Entry to social assistance use was associated with some 
      1511-2619€ (50% compared to the control group) higher cumulative health and 
      social care costs of the children three years after their families transitioned 
      to social assistance, compared to the group that did not enter to social 
      assistance system. This difference was primarily attributed to higher social care 
      costs. Continued social assistance use was associated with some 1007-2709€ (31%) 
      higher costs compared to the comparison group that exited social assistance. 
      These findings support an economic argument to prevent families from entering 
      economic difficulties and to help those in such situations to transition out.

TI  - Two Weeks Versus One Week of Maximal Patient-Intensivist Continuity for Adult 
      Medical Intensive Care Patients: A Two-Center Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 1323-1332
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000006322 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes for 2 weeks vs. 1 week of maximal 
      patient-intensivist continuity in the ICU. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. 
      SETTING: Two U.S. urban, teaching, medical ICUs where intensivists were scheduled 
      for 2-week service blocks: site A was in the Midwest and site B was in the 
      Northeast. PATIENTS: Patients 18 years old or older admitted to a study ICU 
      between March 1, 2017, and February 28, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS 
      AND MAIN RESULTS: We applied target trial emulation to compare admission during 
      an intensivist's first week (as a proxy for 2 wk of maximal continuity) vs. 
      admission during their second week (as a proxy for 1 wk of maximal continuity). 
      Outcomes included hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, and, for mechanically 
      ventilated patients, duration of ventilation. Exploratory outcomes included 
      imaging, echocardiogram, and consultation orders. We used inverse probability 
      weighting to adjust for baseline differences and random-effects meta-analysis to 
      calculate overall effect estimates. Among 2571 patients, 1254 were admitted 
      during an intensivist's first week and 1317 were admitted during a second week. 
      At sites A and B, hospital mortality rates were 25.8% and 24.2%, median ICU 
      length of stay were 4 and 2 days, and median mechanical ventilation durations 
      were 3 and 3 days, respectively. There were no differences in adjusted mortality 
      (odds ratio [OR], 1.01 [95% CI, 0.96-1.06]) or ICU length of stay (-0.25 d [-0.82 
      d to +0.32 d]) for 2 weeks vs. 1 week of maximal continuity. Among mechanically 
      ventilated patients, there were no differences in adjusted mortality (OR, 1.00 
      [0.87-1.16]), ICU length of stay (+0.06 d [-0.78 d to +0.91 d]), or duration of 
      mechanical ventilation (+0.37 d [-0.46 d to +1.21 d]) for 2 weeks vs. 1 week of 
      maximal continuity. CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks of maximal patient-intensivist 
      continuity was not associated with differences in clinical outcomes compared with 
      1 week in two medical ICUs.

TI  - Effectiveness of health checkup with depression screening on depression treatment 
      and outcomes in middle-aged and older adults: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 100978
LID - 10.1016/j.lanwpc.2023.100978 [doi]
LID - 100978
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult preventive health checkups with depression screening were 
      launched in August 2011 in Taiwan; however, its impact has not yet been 
      evaluated. This study aimed to use real-world data to assess the effectiveness of 
      depression screening among middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: A total of 
      4,972,228 adults aged 40 years and above who participated in a health checkup 
      with depression screening between 2013 and 2019 and the same number of unscreened 
      counterparts were included. The target trial emulation study was conducted to 
      estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for newly treated depression, psychiatric 
      hospitalisation, and suicide. The changes in HRs during the study period were 
      assessed using interval Cox models. FINDINGS: The screening group had a higher 
      rate of newly treated depression (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.62, 1.64]) and a lower risk 
      of psychiatric hospitalisation (HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.91, 0.95]). There was a null 
      association between depression screening and suicide; however, a higher suicide 
      risk was found in screened older adults aged 65 years and above. Only 10.8% 
      received depression treatment during the study period among the screen-positive 
      individuals. INTERPRETATION: Health checkups with depression screening could 
      potentially promote depression treatment and reduce the risk of psychiatric 
      hospitalisation; however, there was no effect on suicide. The treatment rate for 
      depression remained low after screening for depression. Further attention to 
      enhance referral and treatment is required. FUNDING: The study was funded by the 
      National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan.

TI  - Impact of ibrutinib dose adjustment on TTNT in first-line CLL/SLL: a real-world 
      analysis using target trial emulation.
PG  - 100022
LID - 10.1016/j.bneo.2024.100022 [doi]
LID - 100022
AB  - Ibrutinib, a once-daily Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a standard-of-care 
      first-line (1L) treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
      (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Dosing flexibility (adjustment to daily 
      dose of <420 mg/d) with ibrutinib can help prevent recurrence or worsening of 
      adverse events while maintaining long-term efficacy. This study compared time to 
      next treatment among patients with CLL/SLL in the United States initiating 1L 
      single-agent ibrutinib at 420 mg/d (index date) and staying on this dose vs 
      patients with dose adjustment (DA) within 3 to 12 months. Two databases were 
      used: Komodo claims (a majority from community practices) and Acentrus electronic 
      medical records (from academic and nonteaching hospital systems). To account for 
      immortal time bias (patients with DA survived on 1L therapy until DA) and overlap 
      between follow-up time and definition of treatment strategies, a target trial 
      emulation approach was used, in which patients were cloned at index date and 
      contributed follow-up to both treatment strategy arms until deviation from the 
      strategy. Among 3343 patients in Komodo (mean age: 67.5 years; 37.6% female) and 
      1171 patients in Acentrus (mean age: 70.4 years; 34.6% female) who initiated 1L 
      single-agent ibrutinib 420 mg/d, 18.0% and 19.6%, respectively, had a DA. DA was 
      not associated with an increased risk of having a next treatment in both 
      databases (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: Komodo: 0.95 
      [0.80-1.14], Acentrus: 1.14 [0.80-1.62]). These findings suggest that a flexible 
      dosing approach with ibrutinib may be effective in allowing patients to achieve 
      optimal outcomes while remaining on long-term continuous 1L treatment.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There are limited data for the utility of statins for primary 
      prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and death in adults 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of 
      statin use with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events 
      (MACE) among US veterans older than 65 years with CKD stages 3 to 4. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used a target trial emulation design 
      for statin initiation among veterans with moderate CKD (stages 3 or 4) using 
      nested trials with a propensity weighting approach. Linked Veterans Affairs (VA) 
      Healthcare System, Medicare, and Medicaid data were used. This study considered 
      veterans newly diagnosed with moderate CKD between 2005 and 2015 in the VA, with 
      follow-up through December 31, 2017. Veterans were older than 65 years, within 5 
      years of CKD diagnosis, had no prior ASCVD or statin use, and had at least 1 
      clinical visit in the year prior to trial baseline. Eligibility criteria were 
      assessed for each nested trial, and Cox proportional hazards models with 
      bootstrapping were run. Analysis was conducted from July 2021 to October 2023. 
      EXPOSURE: Statin initiation vs none. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome 
      was all-cause mortality; secondary outcome was time to first MACE (myocardial 
      infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, revascularization, or mortality). 
      RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 14 828 veterans. Mean (SD) age at CKD 
      diagnosis was 76.9 (8.2) years, 14 616 (99%) were men, 10 539 (72%) White, and 
      2568 (17%) Black. After expanding to person-trials and assessing eligibility at 
      each baseline, there were 151 243 person-trials (14 685 individuals) of nonstatin 
      initiators and 2924 person-trials (2924 individuals) of statin initiators 
      included. Propensity score adjustment via overlap weighting with nonparametric 
      bootstrapping resulted in covariate balance, with mean (SD) follow-up of 3.6 
      (2.7) years. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.91 (95% CI, 
      0.85-0.97) comparing statin initiators to noninitiators. The hazard ratio for 
      MACE was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91-1.02). Results remained consistent in prespecified 
      subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this target trial emulation of 
      statin initiation in US veterans older than 65 years with CKD stages 3 to 4 and 
      no prior ASCVD, statin initiation was significantly associated with a lower risk 
      of all-cause mortality but not MACE. Results should be confirmed in a randomized 
      clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of molnupiravir for high-risk adults in 
      a highly vaccinated Asian population is sparse. In this study, we aimed to 
      estimate the association between molnupiravir use and hospital admission or death 
      in high-risk adults with COVID-19 during the Omicron era. METHODS: This 
      retrospective cohort study included high-risk patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in 
      Shimonoseki City between September 16, 2022, and May 8, 2023. The outcome was a 
      composite of hospital admission or death within 28 days. Participants were 
      categorized into two groups: those who used molnupiravir within 5 days of 
      diagnosis and those who did not. The outcomes were compared using a Cox 
      proportional hazards model. Treatment weighting was used to balance patient 
      backgrounds between the groups, and the clone method with inverse probability of 
      censoring weighting was used to adjust for informative censoring. RESULTS: We 
      analyzed 330 patients (190 females, 57.6 %) with a mean age of 68.6 years. The 
      proportion of fully vaccinated and boosted patients was 82.9 % (155/187) in the 
      molnupiravir group and 90.2 % (129/143) in the control group. The overall 28-day 
      incidence of all-cause hospitalization and mortality was 5.2 % (17/330), with 
      3.2 % (6/187) in the molnupiravir group and 7.7 % (11/143) in the control group. 
      Molnupiravir was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions or death 
      within 28 days (weighted hazard ratio, 0.35 [95 % confidence intervals, 0.13 to 
      0.90]). CONCLUSIONS: Molnupiravir was linked to fewer hospitalizations or deaths 
      within 28 days compared to no treatment in highly vaccinated high-risk patients 
      with COVID-19 in Japan.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of vaccination with a monovalent 
      covid-19 mRNA vaccine containing the omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant against severe 
      covid-19 disease in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. DESIGN: Target trial emulation 
      based on registry data. SETTING: Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, 1 October 2023 to 
      21 April 2024. PARTICIPANTS: Source population of 3 898 264 individuals eligible 
      for vaccination with the XBB.1.5 containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine at the start of 
      the study on 1 October 2023. Study cohort comprised 1 876 282 recipients of an 
      XBB.1.5 containing vaccine during the study period matched with 1 876 282 
      non-recipients. Individuals were aged ≥65 years (mean age 75.4 years, standard 
      deviation 7.4 years) and had received at least four doses of a previous covid-19 
      vaccine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidences of hospital admissions and 
      deaths related to covid-19 in a follow-up period of 24 weeks after immunisation 
      (defined as one week after vaccination) in recipients of an XBB.1.5 containing 
      covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used 
      to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk 
      differences. RESULTS: The associated comparative vaccine effectiveness was 57.9% 
      (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.9% to 65.8%) against hospital admission for 
      covid-19 (1085 v 2635 events) and 75.2% (70.6% to 79.9%) against deaths related 
      to covid-19 disease (348 v 1458 events) after 24 weeks of follow-up. This result 
      corresponded to 154.7 (95% CI 78.3 to 231.0) hospital admissions for covid-19 and 
      120.3 (110.5 to 130.2) deaths prevented per 100 000 individuals who were 
      vaccinated with an XBB.1.5 containing vaccine. The associated comparative vaccine 
      effectiveness was similar irrespective of sex, age group (65-74 v ≥75 years), 
      number of doses of previous covid-19 vaccines, subgroup of co-administered 
      seasonal influenza vaccines, and period of when either the omicron XBB or BA.2.86 
      sublineage was predominant. Although the observed reduction in risk was highest 
      during the first weeks after vaccination, comparative vaccine effectiveness was 
      well maintained after 24 weeks of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, in 
      adults aged ≥65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5 containing covid-19 
      mRNA vaccine was associated with reduced rates of hospital admissions for 
      covid-19 and deaths related to covid-19, during the autumn and winter of 2023-24 
      in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden.

TI  - Optimizing physician-encounter frequency for type 2 diabetes patients in primary 
      care based on cardiovascular risk assessment: A target trial emulation study.
PG  - 5358-5367
LID - 10.1111/dom.15899 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether the physician-encounter interval for patients with 
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be optimized from 2-3 to 4-6 months among those with a 
      calculated 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score of less than 20% 
      without compromising their long-term outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 
      territory-wide public electronic medical records in Hong Kong, we emulated a 
      target trial to compare the effectiveness of the physician-encounter intervals of 
      4-6 versus 2-3 months for T2D patients without prior CVDs and with a predicted 
      risk for CVDs of less than 20% (i.e. those patients not in the high-risk 
      category). Propensity score matching was used to emulate the randomization of 
      participants at baseline, where 42 154 matched individuals were included for 
      analysis. The marginal structural model was applied to estimate the hazard ratio 
      (HR) for CVD incidence and all-cause mortality, the incidence rate ratio of 
      secondary and tertiary care utilization, as well as the between-group differences 
      in HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. RESULTS: During a follow-up 
      period of up to 12 (average: 5.1) years, there was no significantly increased 
      risk of CVD in patients with physician-encounter intervals of 4-6 months compared 
      with those patients with physician-encounter intervals of 2-3 months (HR [95% 
      confidence interval {CI}]: 1.01 [0.90, 1.14]; standardized 10-year risk 
      difference [95% CI]: -0.1% [-0.7%, 0.6%]), nor for all-cause mortality (HR: 1.00 
      [0.84, 1.20]; standardized 10-year risk difference: -0.1% [-0.5%, 0.3%]). 
      Additionally, there was no observable difference in the utilization of secondary 
      and tertiary care or key clinical parameters between these two follow-up 
      frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: For T2D patients with a calculated 10-year CVD risk of 
      less than 20%, the interval of regular physician encounters can be optimized from 
      2-3 to 4-6 months without compromising patients' long-term outcomes and saving 
      substantial service resources in primary care.

TI  - Causal inference using observational intensive care unit data: a scoping review 
      and recommendations for future practice.
PG  - 221
LID - 10.1038/s41746-023-00961-1 [doi]
LID - 221
AB  - This scoping review focuses on the essential role of models for causal inference 
      in shaping actionable artificial intelligence (AI) designed to aid clinicians in 
      decision-making. The objective was to identify and evaluate the reporting quality 
      of studies introducing models for causal inference in intensive care units 
      (ICUs), and to provide recommendations to improve the future landscape of 
      research practices in this domain. To achieve this, we searched various databases 
      including Embase, MEDLINE ALL, Web of Science Core Collection, Google Scholar, 
      medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and the ACM Digital Library. Studies involving models 
      for causal inference addressing time-varying treatments in the adult ICU were 
      reviewed. Data extraction encompassed the study settings and methodologies 
      applied. Furthermore, we assessed reporting quality of target trial components 
      (i.e., eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, follow-up period, outcome, and 
      analysis plan) and main causal assumptions (i.e., conditional exchangeability, 
      positivity, and consistency). Among the 2184 titles screened, 79 studies met the 
      inclusion criteria. The methodologies used were G methods (61%) and reinforcement 
      learning methods (39%). Studies considered both static (51%) and dynamic 
      treatment regimes (49%). Only 30 (38%) of the studies reported all five target 
      trial components, and only seven (9%) studies mentioned all three causal 
      assumptions. To achieve actionable AI in the ICU, we advocate careful 
      consideration of the causal question of interest, describing this research 
      question as a target trial emulation, usage of appropriate causal inference 
      methods, and acknowledgement (and examination of potential violations of) the 
      causal assumptions.

TI  - Risk of Osteoarthritis and Arthroplasty Between Baclofen and Tizanidine: A Target 
      Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 335-346
LID - 10.1007/s40261-025-01448-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that baclofen may reduce the risk of 
      osteoarthritis through its anti-inflammatory effect. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to 
      clarify this association by comparing the risks of osteoarthritis and joint 
      replacement surgery in patients receiving baclofen and tizanidine. METHODS: This 
      retrospective cohort study was conducted on the global TriNetX platform (October 
      31, 2024). New users of baclofen and tizanidine aged ≥40 years were included in 
      the baclofen and tizanidine group, respectively. The propensity score matching 
      method was used. The primary outcomes were osteoarthritis and joint replacement 
      surgery. The secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, a composite outcome 
      of osteoarthritis and all-cause mortality, and a composite outcome of joint 
      replacement surgery and all-cause mortality. Cause specific hazard ratios (HRs) 
      with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the outcomes were calculated with Cox 
      regression using the TriNetX platform. RESULTS: Two well-balanced groups 
      containing 68,210 patients each were generated by propensity score matching (age: 
      57.8 years; female: 55.6% in both groups). Baclofen users had a significantly 
      lower risk of developing osteoarthritis than tizanidine users (HR: 0.965, 95% CI: 
      0.941 to 0.989). A similar relationship was observed for joint replacement 
      surgery (HR: 0.847, 95% CI: 0.750 to 0.956). However, the composite outcome of 
      osteoarthritis or death had a HR of 1.129 (95% CI: 1.109 to 1.150), and the HR of 
      joint replacement surgery or death was 1.509 (95% CI: 1.463 to 1.556). The HR of 
      death was 1.577 (95% CI: 1.527 to 1.629), suggesting a higher risk of mortality 
      in the baclofen group. CONCLUSION: The surviving baclofen users had a lower risk 
      of osteoarthritis and joint replacement surgery compared to surviving tizanidine 
      users. However, baclofen users exhibited a higher risk of mortality than 
      tizanidine users. Future studies are necessary to clarify the impact of baclofen 
      on osteoarthritis and joint replacement surgery while accounting for mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence is limited regarding the comparative effectiveness and 
      safety of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) vs catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) 
      for high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). OBJECTIVES: This observational study aimed 
      to compare the outcomes of older adults with high-risk PE treated with MT vs CDT 
      using a target trial emulation framework. METHODS: We included Medicare 
      fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 to 99 years admitted with high-risk PE 
      (defined by cardiac arrest, shock, and vasopressor use) who underwent MT/CDT from 
      2017 to 2020. We evaluated 1-year mortality using an inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting approach, controlling for 62 baseline covariates. We also 
      evaluated readmissions and in-hospital outcomes, including intracranial 
      hemorrhage. Patients were followed from the date of the index procedure to the 
      outcomes of interest, 1 year, or December 2020. RESULTS: We included 235 and 484 
      patients in the MT and CDT groups, respectively. The absolute risk of 1-year 
      mortality was 48.4% (95% CI: 34.1%-63.3%) in the MT group and 45.4% (95% CI: 
      37.8%-55.8%) in the CDT group, with an adjusted HR of 1.16 (95% CI: 0.84-1.59). 
      We found no evidence that all-cause readmission (MT vs CDT; subdistribution HR: 
      0.89; 95% CI: 0.56-1.40), intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 
      0.07-1.77), or transfusions (adjusted OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.52-1.76) differed 
      significantly between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults with 
      high-risk PE treated with catheter-based therapies, the clinical outcomes were 
      similar between the patients treated with MT vs CDT. Randomized trials are needed 
      to confirm our findings.

TI  - Discontinuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors after incident hyperkalemia and 
      clinical outcomes: target trial emulation.
PG  - 2034-2044
LID - 10.1038/s41440-025-02218-8 [doi]
AB  - Although renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) are the mainstay in the 
      management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, chronic kidney 
      disease, and other cardiovascular conditions, they are often discontinued due to 
      hyperkalemia. The prognostic impact of discontinuing RASi after developing 
      hyperkalemia remains uncertain. Using a target trial framework based on the 
      cloning, censoring, and weighting method, we compared discontinuing RASi after 
      incident hyperkalemia with continuing RASi. We identified 2305 patients with an 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥10 ml/min/1.73 m(2) who developed 
      hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels ≥5.5 mEq/L) while on RASi in the Osaka 
      Consortium for Kidney Disease Research (OCKR) database. The primary outcome was a 
      composite of initiation of kidney replacement therapy, a ≥50% decline in eGFR, or 
      reaching eGFR <5 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Secondary outcomes included all-cause death 
      and severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels ≥6.5 mEq/L). The mean (standard 
      deviation) age and eGFR were 68 (14) years and 29 (17) mL/min/1.73 m², 
      respectively. After developing hyperkalemia, 346 (15%) discontinued RASi. 
      Discontinuing RASi was associated with a 16% [95% confidence interval 2-33%] 
      higher hazard of mortality than continuing RASi while the composite kidney 
      outcome did not differ between groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.01 
      [0.81-1.26]). Severe hyperkalemia occurred less frequently in those who 
      discontinued RASi than those who continued RASi (adjusted HR 0.83 [0.69, 0.99]). 
      RASi discontinuation after incident hyperkalemia was associated with higher 
      mortality despite a lower risk of severe hyperkalemia. It was not related to 
      kidney outcome. Appropriate clinical decision-making regarding RASi 
      discontinuation may depend on the clinical context.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to determine the appropriate 
      gestational age for planned births by elective cesarean section (ECS) or 
      induction of labor (IOL) in relation to no excess risk of neonatal respiratory 
      distress. STUDY DESIGN: Register-based Swedish cohort study including 575,817 
      singleton live births at 36 weeks or later. Births not eligible for vaginal 
      delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes and infants with congenital 
      anomalies were excluded. The primary outcome was respiratory distress, and a 
      secondary outcome was Apgar score <7 at five minutes. The risk of outcomes 
      according to onset of birth was calculated for each day from gestational week 36 
      to 41 and compared with expectant management (EM), defined as births at least one 
      day later. RESULTS: No excess risk of respiratory distress was found for ECS from 
      40 weeks and for IOL from 38 weeks compared with EM. At 37 weeks, the absolute 
      risk of respiratory distress was 12.4 % for ECS (aRR:5.7; 95 %CI:4.8; 6.5) and 
      4.0 % for IOL (aRR:1.7; 95 %CI:1.5; 2.0). At 39 weeks, the absolute risk of 
      respiratory distress for ECS was 3.2 % (aRR:1.6; 95 %CI:1.3; 1.8) whereas the 
      risk was reduced for IOL. ECS <38 weeks increased the risk of Apgar <7 compared 
      with EM. CONCLUSION: Regarding neonatal respiratory distress, IOL was safe from 
      38 weeks and ECS from 40 weeks. At earlier gestational ages, the risk of 
      respiratory distress was significantly higher, which highlights the importance of 
      clear health policies regarding appropriate timing and indications for planned 
      births by ECS and IOL.

AB  - AIMS: There's no scientific consensus on the best way to diagnose gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) globally. This study uses target trial emulation to 
      assess different glycemic criteria for GDM diagnosis. METHODS: 38,995 singleton - 
      pregnant women who took a 75 - g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-32 weeks of 
      gestation were involved. Cloning, censoring, and inverse probability weighting 
      were applied for emulation. Log - binomial regression estimated the effects of 
      various criteria on adverse birth outcomes, and statistical significance and 
      estimates were evaluated. RESULTS: 4,539 women (11.6 %) were diagnosed with lower 
      criteria, 2,463 (6.3 %) with intermediate, and 1,744 (4.5 %) with higher 
      criteria. The proportion of large - for - gestational - age (LGA) infants was 
      7.12 % in the lower criteria group and 8.26 % in the higher criteria group (RR = 
      0.96, 95 % CI: 0.90 to 1.02). Similar LGA risks were found between intermediate 
      and lower criteria. All outcomes showed statistical significance and agreement 
      with targeted trials. CONCLUSIONS: Lower glycemic criteria increased GDM 
      diagnosis 2.53 - fold compared to higher criteria and 1.80 - fold relative to 
      intermediate criteria, yet risks of LGA newborns and other issues remained 
      unchanged.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Type 2 diabetes and hypertension are obesity-related, noncommunicable 
      diseases becoming increasingly common worldwide. In 2008, Japan launched a 
      nationwide universal health checkup program, Specific Health Checkup (SHC), for 
      the primary prevention of obesity-related diseases, but its effectiveness has 
      been understudied. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the SHC program 
      with incident diabetes and hypertension, using a target trial emulation 
      framework. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study 
      used data from a longitudinal health care database involving both checkup history 
      and medical encounter records in Japan. Individuals aged 40 to 74 years, without 
      diabetes or hypertension, and without a prior checkup history, were eligible. 
      Individuals were repeatedly assessed for eligibility from April 1, 2008, to March 
      31, 2020, to assemble sequential cohorts of 78 620 SHC participants and 214 554 
      nonparticipants. Statistical analysis was conducted from June 8 to December 30, 
      2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The composite risk of incident type 2 diabetes 
      or hypertension over a period of up to 10 years, defined as the combination of a 
      newly documented diagnosis and use of relevant medications. A propensity 
      score-weighted survival analysis was conducted to adjust for baseline variables. 
      A series of sensitivity analyses and a negative outcome control analysis were 
      conducted using depression as a benchmark. RESULTS: Sequential cohorts consisted 
      of 78 620 SHC participants (median age, 46 years [IQR, 41-53 years]; 62.7% women) 
      and 214 554 nonparticipants (median age, 49 years [IQR, 44-55 years]; 82.0% 
      women) from 153 084 unique persons, each of whom entered the study cohort a mean 
      (SD) of 1.9 (1.5) times. Within a median follow-up of 4.2 years (IQR, 2.7-6.3 
      years), the primary end point occurred among 11.2% of all individuals (10.6% of 
      the SHC participants and 11.4% of the nonparticipants), with a lower hazard ratio 
      (HR) among the SHC recipients (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89-0.92); the difference in 
      cumulative incidence at 10 years was -1.6% (95% CI, -1.8% to -1.3%). The 
      sensitivity analyses showed similar results. The negative control analysis 
      suggested the potential for residual confounding (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07); 
      the bias-calibrated HR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.89) for the primary outcome. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, within a median of 4.2 years of 
      follow-up, SHC recipients had a 9.8% lower risk of incident diabetes and 
      hypertension (13.8% in the bias-calibrated analysis). The cost-effectiveness of 
      the SHC and its transportability to other regions are unclear, requiring future 
      investigations.

      microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
PG  - 2484-2493
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keae219 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two different intravenous 
      methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse doses in patients with severe microscopic 
      polyangiitis (MPA) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). METHODS: We 
      emulated a target trial using observational data from the nationwide registry in 
      Japan. Patients with severe glomerulonephritis or diffuse alveolar haemorrhage 
      were selected and pseudo-randomized into three groups using propensity 
      score-based overlap weighting as follows: non-IVMP, IVMP 0.5 g/day and IVMP 
      1.0 g/day. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary 
      outcomes were composite all-cause mortality and kidney failure, severe relapse 
      and serious infection from 2 to 48 weeks after treatment initiation. To estimate 
      the treatment effects, the Cox proportional hazard model and Fine-Gray 
      subdistribution hazard model were used. RESULTS: In this emulated target trial, 
      of 201 eligible patients (MPA, 175; GPA, 26), 6 (3%) died, 4 (2.0%) had kidney 
      failure, 11 (5.5%) had severe relapse, and 40 (19.9%) had severe infections. 
      Hazard ratios (HR) for IVMP 0.5 g/day and IVMP 1.0 g/day pulse groups compared 
      with non-IVMP pulse were as follows: all-cause mortality 0.46 (95% CI: 0.07, 
      2.81) and 0.07 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.41), respectively; all-cause mortality/kidney 
      failure 1.18 (95% CI: 0.26, 5.31) and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.08, 4.52), respectively; 
      subdistribution HRs for severe relapse were 1.26 (95% CI: 0.12, 13.70) and 3.36 
      (95% CI: 0.49, 23.29), respectively; and for serious infection 1.88 (95% CI: 
      0.76, 4.65) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.28, 3.13), respectively. CONCLUSION: IVMP 
      1.0 g/day pulse may improve 48-week mortality in patients with severe MPA/GPA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that 
      glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists (GLP1-ras) may offer neuroprotective 
      and cardiovascular benefits. However, concerns have been raised about potential 
      adverse effects of GLP1-ras including depression and suicidal ideation. This 
      target-trial-emulation study aims to examine the effects of GLP1-ras treatment on 
      psychiatric hospital admission and all-cause mortality in individuals with 
      schizophrenia. METHODS: We used the Danish nationwide registers to identify all 
      individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and who were treated with metformin 
      (Glucophage). Among these, we identified those who initiated second-line 
      treatment for type-2-diabetes with one of the following glucose-lowering drugs: 
      GLP1-ras, sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2-inhibitors(SGLT2is), or 
      dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-inhibitors(DPP-4is). We then compared the hazard rate 
      ratios(HRR) for psychiatric admission and all-cause mortality between the 
      different treatment arms using a Cox-proportional-hazards model, adjusting for 
      covariates to minimize confounding. RESULTS: We included 354 individuals with 
      schizophrenia(47 % female, mean age 43.8 years) and type-2-diabetes who initiated 
      treatment with a second-line GLD. Of these, 71, 197, and 86 initiated treatment 
      with GLP1-ras, DPP-4is, and SGLT2is respectively. We found no difference in the 
      risk of psychiatric admission between the three treatment arms. In the fully 
      adjusted model, treatment with DPP-4is and SGLT2is analysed as a compound 
      exposure, was not associated with a significant reduced risk of psychiatric 
      admission, with a HRR of 0.78(95 %-CI:0.38-1.59), when compared to GLP1-ras. Only 
      5 deaths occurred during follow-up, making a comparison of all-cause mortality 
      between the treatment arms unfeasible. CONCLUSION: We observed no difference in 
      the risk of psychiatric admission or all-cause mortality for individuals with 
      schizophrenia treated with GLP1-ras compared to SGLT2is and DPP-4is.

TI  - Global containment policy duration and long-term epidemic progression: A target

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Global countries often apply containment policies (CPs) to combat 
      infectious disease surges. Whether countries with longer cumulative duration of 
      CPs are associated with slower long-term epidemic progression necessitates a 
      thorough evaluation. METHODS: We collected CP and COVID-19 data of 185 
      territories during 2020-2022, with a total of 23 CPs. Using the target trial 
      emulation and cloning-censoring-weighting approaches, we assessed the 
      effectiveness of CPs with different cumulative durations in delaying countries 
      from reaching the 1% and 10% cumulative infection incidence end points (i.e. 
      10,000 and 100,000 COVID-19 cases per million population, respectively) over a 
      3-year observation period. RESULTS: For reaching the 1% cumulative infection 
      incidence, recommending closing workplaces and limiting gatherings to 10 people, 
      each presented that a longer cumulative duration of those CPs is associated with 
      a lower proportion of countries achieving this end point throughout 2020-2022. 
      For reaching the 10% cumulative infection incidence, mandatory bans on public 
      events and domestic movements, closing public transports, and screening and 
      quarantining inbound tourists, each showed similar associations. Notably, 
      long-lasting border bans upon high-risk regions are associated with a higher 
      proportion of countries reaching the 10% cumulative infection incidence. 
      CONCLUSIONS: From the long-term perspective, we highlight CPs that warrant 
      extending the duration to achieve slower epidemic progression. By contrast, our 
      findings demonstrate the limited effectiveness of the ban on regions in slowing 
      the long-term epidemic progression.

TI  - Effectiveness of the 2023-to-2024 XBB.1.5 COVID-19 Vaccines Over Long-Term 
      Follow-up : A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 348-359
LID - 10.7326/ANNALS-24-01015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monovalent COVID-19 vaccines targeting the XBB.1.5 Omicron variant 
      were introduced in September 2023. In the absence of randomized controlled trials 
      demonstrating their efficacy, information on real-world vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) is needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine XBB.1.5 COVID-19 VE and the extent to 
      which it declines over time. DESIGN: Target trial emulation. SETTING: U.S. 
      Veterans Health Administration. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible XBB.1.5 vaccine recipients 
      were matched 1:1 to unvaccinated persons in 7 sequential biweekly trials with 
      enrollment from 2 October 2023 through 3 January 2024. INTERVENTION: XBB.1.5 
      COVID-19 vaccination versus no XBB.1.5 vaccination. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were 
      ascertained through 10 May 2024 and included any positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 
      test from day 10 after the matched index date, subsequent hospitalization within 
      1 day before or 10 days after the positive result, or death within 30 days after 
      the positive result. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 100 × (1 - risk 
      ratio). RESULTS: Participants (91.3% male; mean age, 69.9 years) included 587 137 
      pairs of vaccinated and matched unvaccinated persons. Over a mean follow-up of 
      176 days (range, 118 to 211 days), VE was -3.26% (95% CI, -6.78% to -0.22%) 
      against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, 16.64% (CI, 6.47% to 25.77%) against 
      SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization, and 26.61% (CI, 5.53% to 42.32%) against 
      SARS-CoV-2-associated death. When estimated at 60, 90, and 120 days, 
      respectively, VE against documented infection (14.21%, 7.29%, and 3.15%), 
      hospitalization (37.57%, 30.84%, and 25.25%), or death (54.24%, 44.33%, and 
      30.25%) showed substantial waning. LIMITATION: Potential for residual confounding 
      and incomplete capture of COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes. 
      CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccines targeting the XBB.1.5 variant of Omicron were not 
      effective in preventing infection and had relatively low VE against 
      hospitalization and death, which declined rapidly over time. PRIMARY FUNDING

TI  - Mortality of metallo-β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales bacteremias with 
      combined ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam vs. other active antibiotics: a 
      multicenter target trial emulation.
PG  - 101175

LID - 101175
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteremias caused by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing 
      Enterobacterales are a critical challenge due to their limited treatment options. 
      Although ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZAVI) combined with aztreonam (ATM) has shown 
      in vitro efficacy, no prior studies have rigorously compared its clinical 
      effectiveness to Other Active Antibiotics (OAAs). This study aims to evaluate the 
      efficacy and safety of CAZAVI + ATM vs. OAAs in a large cohort of MBL bacteremia. 
      METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter, target trial emulation was conducted 
      across 17 hospitals in Argentina between January 2016 and October 2024. Patients 
      with confirmed MBL bacteremia who initiated active antibiotic treatment within 24 
      h of MBL identification and 96 h of blood sampling were included. Inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to reduce indication bias, and 
      the analysis accounted for hospital clustering within Argentina's public, 
      private, and social security health systems. The primary outcome was 30-day 
      all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes including clinical failure (relapse, 
      complications, or death) and adverse events. FINDINGS: Among 243 patients (93 
      receiving CAZAVI + ATM and 150 receiving OAAs), the 30-day mortality rate was 35% 
      in the CAZAVI + ATM group vs. 47% in the OAA group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 
      0·63, 95% CI 0·43-0·91, p < 0·01). Clinical failure occurred in 46% of the CAZAVI 
      + ATM group and 53% of the OAA group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·65, 95% CI 
      0·44-0·97; p = 0·03). Adverse events were lower with CAZAVI + ATM (9·6% vs. 
      22·8%, p = 0·014). INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest CAZAVI + ATM might be 
      associated with lower mortality, reduced clinical failure, and fewer adverse 
      events compared to OAAs in patients with MBL-type Enterobacterales bacteremia. 
      Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations. FUNDING: 
      No specific funding was provided for this study.

TI  - The Effect on Extubation of Early vs. Late Definitive Closure of the Patent 
      Ductus Arteriosus in Premature Infants: A Target Trial Emulation Using Electronic 
      Health Records.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14062072 [doi]
LID - 2072
AB  - Background/Objectives: Premature infants are often referred for the definitive 
      procedural closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with the failure of, or 
      contraindication to, pharmacotherapy and the inability to wean respiratory 
      support. However, once this need is identified, the importance of expedited 
      closure is unclear. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of the 
      timing of definitive closure (i.e., surgical ligation or device occlusion) on 
      early respiratory outcomes in premature infants. Method: We first specify a 
      hypothetical randomized trial (the "target trial") that would estimate the effect 
      on extubation of early (0-4 days from referral) vs. late (5-14 days from 
      referral) definitive PDA closure. We then emulate this target trial using a 
      single-institution registry of premature infants (born <30 weeks or with a birth 
      weight < 1500 g) who underwent the definitive closure of PDA between January 2014 
      and October 2023. Results: We identify 131 eligible infants. At the end of the 
      follow-up, 70 and 38 infants were adherent to early and late PDA closure 
      strategies, respectively. The cumulative incidence of extubation in the early 
      group was higher than that in the late group until day 40 (maximum risk 
      difference: 22 percentage points at day 13; 95% CI: -11 to 56). Outcomes were 
      similar at the end of the 45-day follow-up period (risk difference: -1 percentage 
      point; 95% CI: -46 to 42). Conclusions: The need for mechanical ventilation was 
      equivalent between early and late PDA closure strategies at the end of a 45-day 
      follow-up period although infants in the early intervention group were extubated 
      sooner.

TI  - Impact of doxycycline on mycoplasma pneumonia treatment and cancer prognosis in 
      pediatric leukemia patients post-chemotherapy: a target trial emulation.
PG  - 1790-1805
LID - 10.62347/KGBQ9641 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute leukemia is the most common malignancy in children. While 
      chemotherapy is effective, it significantly compromises immune function, leading 
      to a high incidence of infectious complications, such as secondary pneumonia, 
      particularly Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP). The treatment of infections in pediatric 
      leukemia patients faces challenges such as antibiotic resistance and drug 
      interactions during chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the 
      therapeutic efficacy and safety of doxycycline in treating MP in pediatric 
      leukemia patients post-chemotherapy, as well as it impact on chemotherapy 
      continuity. METHODS: This study employed a target trial emulation design using 
      retrospective data from pediatric leukemia patients diagnosed with MP. Patients 
      aged 12-17 years with confirmed leukemia and clinical evidence of pneumonia 
      following chemotherapy were included. Doxycycline was compared to azithromycin 
      and other empirical treatments. Follow-up assessments at 3 days, 5 days, 30 days, 
      and 180 days evaluated fever resolution, radiological improvement, additional 
      interventions, and adverse events. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier 
      survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: In Trial 2, 
      doxycycline demonstrated a significantly higher treatment success rate than other 
      empirical treatments (87.72% vs. 73.13%, P = 0.013) and was associated with 
      faster fever resolution (P = 0.048) and shorter time to chest X-ray improvement 
      (P = 0.048). The 30-day survival rate was significantly higher in the Doxycycline 
      group compared to other empirical treatments (100% vs. 91.04%, P = 0.019). Fewer 
      patients require additional interventions such as ICU admission (P = 0.019). 
      Furthermore, patients in the Doxycycline group had a significantly higher 
      likelihood of completing chemotherapy without delays (84.21% vs. 59.70%, P = 
      0.01). In Trial 1, no significant differences were observed in treatment success 
      rate, fever resolution time, hospitalization duration, or chemotherapy tolerance 
      between Doxycycline and Azithromycin (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Doxycycline, as a 
      broad-spectrum antibiotic, demonstrates efficacy comparable to azithromycin in 
      treating MP with advantages in reducing chemotherapy-related delays, 
      hospitalization duration, and the need for additional interventions. It enhances 
      chemotherapy tolerance and continuity. Doxycycline may serve as an economical and 
      effective alternative for managing post-chemotherapy infections in pediatric 
      leukemia patients, especially in cases of antibiotic resistance or intolerance.

TI  - Specifying a target trial protocol to estimate the effect of preconception 
      treatment of periodontitis on time-to-pregnancy: A commentary and applied 
      example.
PG  - 125-134
LID - 10.1111/cdoe.13000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The target trial framework was developed as a strategy to design and 
      analyze observational epidemiologic studies with the aim of reducing bias due to 
      analytic decisions. It involves designing a hypothetical randomized trial to 
      answer a question of interest and systematically considering how to use 
      observational data to emulate each trial component. AIMS: The primary aim of this 
      paper is to provide a detailed example of the application of the target trial 
      framework to a research question in oral epidemiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      describe the development of a hypothetical target trial and emulation protocol to 
      evaluate the effect of preconception periodontitis treatment on 
      time-to-pregnancy. We leverage data from Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), a 
      preconception cohort, to ground our example in existing observational data. We 
      discuss the decision-making process for each trial component, as well as 
      limitations encountered. RESULTS: Our target trial application revealed data 
      limitations that precluded us from carrying out the proposed emulation. 
      Implications for data quality are discussed and we provide recommendations for 
      researchers interested in conducting trial emulations in the field of oral 
      epidemiology. DISCUSSION: The target trial framework has the potential to improve 
      the validity of observational research in oral health, when properly applied. 
      CONCLUSION: We encourage the broad adoption of the target trial framework to the 
      field of observational oral health research and demonstrate its value as a tool 
      to identify directions for future research.

TI  - Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization After Truly Curative Resection Does Not 
      Improve Survival of Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma at High Risk of 
      Recurrence: A Target Trial Emulation Study.
LID - 10.1111/hepr.14219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consensus guidelines from China recommend adjuvant transarterial 
      chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are 
      at high risk of recurrence after curative resection. However, some of the 
      clinical evidence behind this recommendation involves patients who underwent 
      palliative resection. METHODS: The study design followed the target trial 
      emulation framework with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and 
      propensity score matching (PSM) to minimize biases. This study compared 
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) during follow-up among 
      patients who received TACE after truly curative resection, defined as absence of 
      tumor staining during postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA); 
      patients who received TACE after palliative resection; and patients who received 
      only active surveillance after both kinds of resection. RESULTS: Patients who 
      received TACE showed significantly higher RFS (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.93) and OS 
      (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.98). However, adjuvant TACE after truly curative 
      resection was associated with marginally, but not significantly, higher RFS (HR 
      0.92, 95% CI 0.80-1.08) and OS (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70-1.06) than active 
      surveillance. The patients who underwent palliative resection, therapeutic TACE 
      was associated with longer RFS (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56-0.87) and OS (HR 0.61, 95% 
      CI 0.45-0.83) than active surveillance. These similar results with both types of 
      survival were found after PSM and IPTW. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant TACE may not 
      improve survival of HCC patients at high risk of recurrence. Our work highlights 
      the efficacy of DSA for detecting microscopic lesions and could help guide 
      adjuvant treatment decisions after hepatic resection.

TI  - Antifibrotics and mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: external validity 
      and avoidance of immortal time bias.
PG  - 293
LID - 10.1186/s12931-024-02922-y [doi]
LID - 293
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pooled analyses of previous randomized controlled 
      trials reported that antifibrotics improved survival in patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but the results were only based on short-term outcome 
      data from selected patients who met strict criteria. Observational 
      studies/meta-analyses also suggested that antifibrotics improve survival, but 
      these studies failed to control for immortal time bias that considerably 
      exaggerates drug effects. Therefore, whether antifibrotics truly improve 
      long-term survival in patients with IPF in the real world remains undetermined 
      and requires external validity. METHODS: We used data from the Japanese National 
      Claims Database to estimate the intention-to-treat effect of antifibrotics on 
      mortality. To address immortal time bias, we employed models treating 
      antifibrotic initiation as a time-dependent covariate and target trial emulation 
      (TTE), both incorporating new-user designs for antifibrotics and treating lung 
      transplantation as a competing event. RESULTS: Of 30,154 patients with IPF, 
      14,525 received antifibrotics. Multivariate Fine-Gray models with antifibrotic 
      initiation as a time-dependent covariate revealed that compared with no 
      treatment, nintedanib (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.81-0.89) and pirfenidone (aHR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93) were associated 
      with reduced mortality. The TTE model also replicated the associations of 
      nintedanib (aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.65-0.74) and pirfenidone (aHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 
      0.78-0.85) with reduced mortality. Subgroup analyses confirmed this association 
      regardless of age, sex, and comorbidities, excluding certain subpopulations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale real-world analysis support the 
      generalizability of the association between antifibrotics and improved survival 
      in various IPF populations.

      in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study.

AB  - Sustained melatonin supplement use may delay pubertal onset, but evidence is 
      limited. In the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, we assessed if 
      melatonin use for 38 months affected the timing of pubertal onset in males 
      (N=3,134) and menarche in females (N=4,424). Pubertal outcomes were 
      parent-reported using the Pubertal Development Scale. We emulated sequential 
      target trials to evaluate the effect of initiating and continuing melatonin 
      supplement use. Findings were contrasted with comparisons of ever- to never-users 
      and initiators to non-initiators using Cox models. In sequentially emulated 
      trials with 1,037,709 person-months among males and 1,818,084 person-months among 
      females, there were 1,872 and 3,377 instances of melatonin use initiation among 
      186 males and 333 females, respectively. Observational analogues of 
      intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects from target trial emulation showed no 
      difference in risk of pubertal onset in males (end-of-follow-up per-protocol 
      RR=1.00, 95%CI=0.87,1.13) or menarche in females (RR=0.93, 95%CI=0.80,1.07). By 
      contrast, Cox models suggested a delay in menarche among 335(7.74%) melatonin 
      ever-users after adjustment for child, family, and neighborhood characteristics 
      collected at the enrollment visit (HR=0.80, 95%CI=(0.69,0.94)). In large samples, 
      rigorous causal analyses that aligned eligibility criteria with treatment 
      initiation and adjusted for time-varying confounding showed no effect of 
      melatonin supplement use on pubertal timing.

TI  - Effectiveness of total hip arthroplasty versus non-surgery on patient-reported 
      hip function at 3 months: a target trial emulation study of patients with 
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - 310-316
LID - 10.2340/17453674.2025.43332 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:  This study introduces an innovative research design in 
      the field of orthopedics, using a target trial emulation approach. We aimed to 
      assess the causal effects of total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared with 
      nonoperative treatment in reducing patient-reported hip disability at 3 months in 
      patients with osteoarthritis, using real-world data. METHODS:  We emulated a 
      target trial using real-world data of 2 Dutch hospitals between April 2020 and 
      January 2022. Patients diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis and eligible for primary 
      THA were included in the study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, THA was often 
      cancelled due to external factors (i.e., limited operating room capacity, or 
      surgeon unavailable due to quarantine rules), resulting in an arbitrary 
      allocation of patients to THA (n = 132) or non-THA (n = 60). We compared changes 
      in hip disability, measured using the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
      Score Physical function Short form (HOOS-PS), between the THA group at 3 months 
      postoperatively and the non-THA group at ≥3 months post waiting-list. Linear 
      regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounders, was used to compare 
      between-group differences. RESULTS:  THA showed preferable outcomes compared with 
      non-THA, indicated by a difference of -33 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      -37 to -28) on the HOOS-PS. Patients in the THA group demonstrated a clinically 
      significant improvement in hip function, with a mean change of -27 points (CI -31 
      to -24), while the control group showed no improvement with a mean change of 7 
      points (CI 3-11) on the HOOS-PS. CONCLUSION:  THA significantly improves hip 
      function in osteoarthritis patients, surpassing the outcomes observed in the 
      non-surgery group.

TI  - The intention-to-treat effect of changes in planned participation on injury risk 
      in adolescent ice hockey players: A target trial emulation.
PG  - 132-139
LID - S1440-2440(24)00524-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2024.09.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Target trial emulation is a framework for conducting causal inference 
      using observational data. We employ this framework to estimate the effect of 
      changing planned participation duration, measured using the acute:chronic 
      workload ratio (ACWR), on injury risk among adolescent ice hockey players without 
      recent injuries. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study designed to emulate a 
      hypothetical randomized trial. METHODS: We used data from a 5-year cohort study 
      (2013-2018) of ice hockey players aged 13-17 years in Alberta and British 
      Columbia. We estimated injury risks associated with different planned changes in 
      hockey participation duration (e.g. half [ACWR = 0.5], no change [ACWR = 1], 
      two-fold [ACWR = 2], three-fold [ACWR = 3], and five-fold [ACWR = 5]) relative to 
      participation in the previous 4 weeks. Outcomes were modeled using generalized 
      additive models. We conducted secondary analyses restricted to concussions, and 
      stratified by league bodychecking status. RESULTS: There were 2633 eligible 
      participants, contributing 115,821 player-trials. Injury risk was 1.9 % (95 % CI: 
      1.7 %-2.3 %) for no change in participation (ACWR = 1). Injury risk ratios (RRs) 
      were 0.43 at ACWR = 0.5 (95 % CI: 0.31-0.54), 1.62 (95 % CI: 1.33-1.98) at 
      ACWR = 2, 1.91 at ACWR = 3 (95 % CI: 1.52-2.48) and 2.35 at ACWR = 5 (95 % CI: 
      1.68-3.26). Patterns were similar by league bodychecking status. Concussion RRs 
      were stable between ACWR = 1 and 1.5, but RRs were greater than for any injury 
      past ACWR = 2. CONCLUSIONS: Within the assumptions of this target trial 
      emulation, injury risk increases consistently (no sweet spots) for increases in 
      planned changes in participation duration relative to the previous 4 weeks among 
      adolescent ice hockey players without recent injuries. Injuries in injury risk 
      are less than expected for the increased exposure time at risk, suggesting 
      beneficial effects of increasing participation that partially counteract the 
      increased exposure time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pivotal trial on venetoclax and hypomethylating agents in unfit 
      elderly acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has got FDA approval. However, Asian 
      patients were under-represented and showed no survival advantage. OBJECTIVE: We 
      aimed to compare overall survival and healthcare resource utilisation in elderly 
      patients newly diagnosed with AML, receiving venetoclax with hypomethylating 
      agents versus hypomethylating agents alone. DESIGN: Target trial emulation. 
      METHODS: Propensity score matching balanced the baseline characteristics. 
      Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression compared overall survival. Negative 
      binomial regression assessed healthcare resource utilisation with time offset. 
      RESULTS: Venetoclax plus hypomethylating agents treatment conferred superior 
      overall survival in patients with AML ⩾60 years old and significantly reduced 
      transfusion requirement compared to those receiving hypomethylating agents alone. 
      The difference was particularly prominent among patients ⩾75 years old. 
      CONCLUSION: Compared to hypomethylating agent alone, venetoclax plus 
      hypomethylating agent benefits elderly patients with AML on overall survival and 
      healthcare resource utilisation.

TI  - Intimate partner relationship strain and general health for prospective mothers 
      and their child: A target trial emulation study.
PG  - 467-478
LID - 10.1037/hea0001473 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the causal effect of: (a) women's exposure 
      to intimate partner relationship strain during early young adulthood (ages 19-20) 
      on self-rated general health at ages 23-28 and during pregnancy (32 weeks' 
      gestation) and (b) women's exposure to relationship strain during early young 
      adulthood and pregnancy on caregiver-reported 12-month-old offspring general 
      health. To strengthen our causal inferences using observational data, we applied 
      a target trial emulation framework. METHOD: This study makes use of maternal and 
      caregiver-reported self-report data spanning young adulthood (three waves) and 
      the early perinatal period (two waves) obtained from a population-based subsample 
      of mothers (N = 300) and their offspring (N = 521), participating in the 
      Australian Temperament Project Generation 3. We estimated the effect 
      (standardized mean difference [β]) using a G-computation procedure. RESULTS: We 
      observed no evidence for an association between maternal relationship strain in 
      early young adulthood and maternal and offspring health (β = -.14 to .00). 
      However, exposure to elevated relationship strain in pregnancy reduced 
      offspring's general health (β = -.29). Associations were strongest for patterns 
      of persistent or time-limited elevated strain during pregnancy (β = -.34 and 
      -.43, respectively), albeit with weaker evidence. CONCLUSION: Evidence for a 
      causal effect of maternal exposure to relationship strain on lower offspring 
      health was found. The results suggest that pregnancy may be a sensitive period 
      for this intergenerational transmission. While the target trial emulation 
      framework does not eliminate all possible biases, it strengthens causal inference 
      and provides precedence for future research to further investigate these 
      intergenerational transmission processes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA,

TI  - A trial emulation approach for policy evaluations with group-level longitudinal 
      data.
LID - arXiv:2011.05826v1
AB  - To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world 
      implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home 
      orders, and numerous studies aim to estimate their effects. Many statistical and 
      econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated 
      measurements and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the 
      COVID-19 context. While these methods are less common in epidemiology, 
      epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in 
      studies of individual-level interventions. "Target trial emulation" emphasizes 
      the need to carefully design a non-experimental study in terms of inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement -- 
      and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using 
      group-level longitudinal ("panel") data need to take a similar careful approach 
      to study design, which we refer to as "policy trial emulation." This is 
      especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the 
      main idea is to construct target trials separately for each "treatment cohort" 
      (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We 
      present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on 
      total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from panel methods -- with the 
      right data and careful modeling and diagnostics -- can help add to our 
      understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging.

TI  - Impact of early initiation of renal replacement therapy in patients on 
      venoarterial ECMO using target trial emulation with Japanese nationwide data.
PG  - 1074

LID - 1074
AB  - While renal replacement therapy (RRT) allows for precise fluid management as well 
      as addressing electrolyte imbalances and the removal of other necessary 
      compounds, its early initiation has not shown benefit in the general critically 
      ill population. Moreover, the effects of early RRT initiation specifically in 
      patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) also 
      remain unclear. This retrospective study investigated adult patients who 
      underwent VA-ECMO between April 2018 and March 2022 and used the 
      clone-censor-weight method to emulate a hypothetical target trial and compare two 
      groups: patients who initiated RRT within 2 days of VA-ECMO initiation (Early) 
      and those who did not (Late). The primary outcomes were 28-day and 90-day 
      hospital mortality analyzed by Cox proportional hazards models and the secondary 
      outcome was 90-day RRT dependence by pooled logistic regression models. Inverse 
      probability censoring weights were applied to adjust the models. A total of 2,513 
      VA-ECMO patients were cloned into both groups. The 28-day and 90-day mortalities 
      were lower in the Early group (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.53-0.68] and 0.67 [0.61-0.75]). 
      However, the early group experienced greater RRT dependence at 90 days than the 
      late group (OR 2.58 [1.94-3.46]). In conclusion, early initiation of RRT (within 
      2 days of VA-ECMO) was associated with lower hospital mortality but with a higher 
      likelihood of 90-day RRT dependence in adult patients on VA-ECMO.

TI  - Investigating Primary Care Indications to Improve the Quality of Electronic 
      Health Record Data in Target Trial Emulation for Dementia.
LID - 2025.04.08.25325485 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2025.04.08.25325485 [doi]
AB  - Missing data, inaccuracies in medication lists, and recording delays in 
      electronic health records (EHR) are major limitations for target trial emulation 
      (TTE), which uses EHR data to retrospectively emulate a clinical trial. EHR-based 
      TTE relies on recorded data that proxy actual drug exposures and outcomes. While 
      prior work has proposed various methods to improve EHR data quality, here we 
      investigate the underutilized consideration that encounters with a primary care 
      provider (PCP) may result in more accurate data in the EHR. Patients with a PCP 
      within the EHR network being studied tend to have more encounters overall and a 
      greater proportion of the types of encounters that yield comprehensive and 
      up-to-date records. By contrasting data for patients with and without a PCP in 
      the considered EHR network, we demonstrate how PCP status affects EHR data 
      quality. Through a case study, we then empirically examine the impact on TTE of 
      including a PCP status feature either in the propensity score and outcome models 
      or as an eligibility criterion for cohort selection, versus ignoring it. 
      Specifically, we compare the estimated effects of two first-line antidiabetic 
      drug classes on the onset of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. We find 
      that the estimated treatment effect is sensitive to the consideration of PCP 
      status, particularly when used as an eligibility criterion. Our work suggests 
      that further researching the role of PCP status may improve the design of 
      pragmatic trials.

TI  - Effectiveness of chemotherapy with/without radiotherapy for stage IVb esophageal 
      squamous cell carcinoma: a population-based target trial emulation study.
PG  - 672

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of radiation therapy in combination with systemic treatment 
      for stage IVb esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unclear. We aimed to 
      investigate the effectiveness of primary chemoradiotherapy for these patients and 
      compare it to that chemotherapy alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 
      retrospective cohort study, we adopted a target trial emulation framework to 
      identify eligible patients in the Taiwan Cancer Registry diagnosed between 2011 
      and 2021. In the primary analysis, overall survival (OS) was the primary 
      endpoint, whereas the incidence of esophageal cancer mortality was the secondary 
      endpoint. Extensive supplementary analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: We 
      included 5294 patients in the primary analysis and found that OS was 
      significantly better for those treated with chemoradiotherapy (n = 5065) than for 
      those treated with chemotherapy only (n = 229). The propensity score weighting 
      adjusted hazard ratio of death was 0.46 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.52, 
      p < 0.0001). The secondary endpoint and supplementary analyses also favored the 
      chemoradiotherapy group. CONCLUSION: The OS of stage IVb ESCC patients treated 
      with chemoradiotherapy was significantly better than that of patients treated 
      with chemotherapy alone. The results of relevant ongoing clinical trials are 
      eagerly awaited.

TI  - Postoperative Weight Loss After Antiobesity Medications and Revision Risk After 
      Joint Replacement.
PG  - e2461200
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.61200 [doi]
LID - e2461200
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The 2023 American College of Rheumatology and American Association of 
      Hip and Knee Surgeons Clinical Practice Guideline concluded that obesity alone 
      should not delay joint replacement. Therefore, a substantially increased 
      utilization of joint replacement among patients with obesity could be expected. 
      However, patients with obesity are at increased risk of revision, posing unique 
      challenges as the surgery is complex and costly, and it remains unknown whether 
      postoperative weight loss could decrease the risk of revision. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine the association of the proportion of postoperative weight loss following 
      antiobesity medication use with the risk of revision among patients with obesity 
      undergoing hip or knee replacement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a 
      target trial emulation, a causal inference framework, this retrospective cohort 
      study investigated patients with obesity who underwent hip or knee replacement. 
      Data were from the IQVIA Medical Research Database (2000-2023). Statistical 
      analysis was performed from October 2023 to June 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Emulated analyses of a hypothetical target trial were assessed for the 
      association of small-to-moderate (2%-10%) or large (≥10%) weight loss after 
      initiating antiobesity medications (orlistat, sibutramine, glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 receptor agonists, and rimonabant) within 1 year with the risk of 
      5-year and 10-year revision after initiation of antiobesity medications. RESULTS: 
      Among 3691 qualified participants (mean [SD] age, 64.7 [9.3] years; 2322 [62.9%] 
      women), the 5-year risks of revision were 5.6%, 4.4%, and 3.7% for weight gain or 
      stable, small-to-moderate weight loss, and large weight loss groups, 
      respectively. Compared with the weight gain or stable group, the hazard ratios 
      (HRs) were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.55-1.04) for the small-to-moderate weight loss group 
      and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.36-0.91) for the large weight loss group. Similar results 
      were observed when the analyses were performed separately for hip or knee 
      replacement. The HRs for revision were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.32-0.93) for 
      small-to-moderate weight loss and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25-0.97) for large weight loss 
      groups compared with the weight gain or stable group in patients undergoing knee 
      replacement; the corresponding HRs for revision were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.54-1.25) and 
      0.53 (95% CI, 0.30-0.93) in patients undergoing hip replacement. Consistent 
      findings were obtained regarding the association of weight loss with the 10-year 
      risks after initiating antiobesity medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 
      this cohort study using a target trial emulation, a higher proportion of weight 
      loss after initiating antiobesity medications within 1 year was associated with a 
      lower risk of 5-year and 10-year revision among patients with obesity undergoing 
      joint replacement. These results suggest that antiobesity medication use, with 
      relatively safe and sustainable weight loss, may be an effective strategy for 
      improving implant survivorship of hip and knee replacements in the obese 
      population.

TI  - Osteoarthritis risk associated with romosozumab compared with teriparatide in 
      individuals with osteoporosis: a target trial emulation study.
LID - S0003-4967(25)04173-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ard.2025.06.2124 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare osteoarthritis among individuals with osteoporosis 
      initiating romosozumab vs an active comparator. METHODS: This new user 
      comparative effectiveness study, emulating a target trial, included individuals 
      aged ≥50 years in the administrative claims database from 2019 to 2022. 
      Individuals who initiated romosozumab were compared with those who initiated 
      teriparatide. The primary outcome was the incidence of osteoarthritis, while 
      secondary outcomes included joint-specific osteoarthritis (knee, hip, and hand) 
      at 1 year. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to 
      balance baseline characteristics between romosozumab and teriparatide users, and 
      inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) was employed to account for 
      informative censoring. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk (RR) at 1 
      year were estimated using a weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: A total of 
      22,145 individuals were included in the study (87% female; mean age, 80 years). 
      After IPTW-IPCW adjustment, romosozumab was associated with a lower risk of 
      osteoarthritis compared with teriparatide (ARR, 1.1% [95% CI, 0.5%-1.8%]; RR, 
      0.79 [0.66, 0.89]). Joint-specific analyses showed the following results: knee 
      osteoarthritis: ARR, 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.5%), RR, 0.79 (0.66, 0.92); hip 
      osteoarthritis: ARR, 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0%-0.5%), RR, 0.68 (0.37, 1.05); and hand 
      osteoarthritis: ARR, 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0%-0.4%), RR, 0.61 (0.35, 1.06). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Romosozumab was associated with a lower risk of osteoarthritis than 
      teriparatide among individuals with osteoporosis, particularly for knee 
      osteoarthritis. Similar trends were observed for hip and hand osteoarthritis; 
      however, the differences were not significant.

AB  - The authors summarize the methodology for a new pragmatic comparative 
      effectiveness research investigation, Cooling Prospectively Infants with Mild 
      Encephalopathy (COOLPRIME), which uses sites' existing mild hypoxic-ischemic 
      encephalopathy (HIE) treatment preference (hypothermia or normothermia) to assess 
      hypothermia effectiveness and safety. COOLPRIME's primary aim is to determine the 
      safety and effectiveness of hypothermia compared to normothermia in mild HIE. 
      Engagement of Families and Community Affected by Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy 
      strongly favored Effectiveness over Efficacy Trials leading to COOL PRIME design.

TI  - Hyperkalemia and maintenance of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy after 
      initiating SGLT-2 or DPP-4 inhibitors.
PG  - 956-966
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfae227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post hoc analyses of clinical trials suggest that sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) lower the risk of hyperkalemia and 
      facilitate the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) in people with 
      type 2 diabetes. Whether this is also observed in routine care is unclear. We 
      investigated whether SGLT-2i lowered the risk of hyperkalemia and RASi 
      discontinuation as compared to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i). 
      METHODS: Using the target trial emulation framework, we studied adults with type 
      2 diabetes (T2D) who started SGLT-2i or DPP-4i in Stockholm, Sweden (2014-2021). 
      The outcomes were incident hyperkalemia (potassium >5.0 mmol/l), mild 
      hyperkalemia (potassium >5-≤5.5 mmol/l), and moderate to severe hyperkalemia 
      (potassium >5.5 mmol/l). Among RASi users, we studied time to RASi 
      discontinuation through evaluation of pharmacy fills. Cox regression with inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting was used to estimate per-protocol hazard 
      ratios (HRs). RESULTS: In total, 29 849 individuals (15 326 SGLT-2i and 14 523 
      DPP-4i initiators) were included (mean age 66 years, 37% women). About one-third 
      of participants in each arm discontinued treatment within 1 year. Compared with 
      DPP-4i, SGLT-2i use was associated with a lower rate of hyperkalemia (HR 0.77; 
      95% CI: 0.64-0.93), including both mild (0.76; 0.62-0.93) and moderate/severe 
      (0.53; 0.40-0.69) hyperkalemia events. Of 19 116 participants who used RASi at 
      baseline, 7% discontinued therapy. Initiation of SGLT-2i vs. DPP-4i was not 
      associated with the rate of RASi discontinuation (0.97; 0.83-1.14). Results were 
      consistent in intention-to-treat analysis and across strata of sex, 
      cardiovascular disease, use of MRA, and use of RASi. CONCLUSIONS: In patients 
      with diabetes managed in routine clinical care, the use of SGLT-2i was associated 
      with lower rates of hyperkalemia compared with DPP-4i. Possibly because of a 
      relatively high rate of treatment discontinuations, this was not accompanied by 
      higher persistence on RASi therapy.

AB  - Prostate cancer and its treatment can impact health-related quality of life. 
      Evidence for physical activity strategies sustained over long periods to improve 
      quality of life is limited. Given the limited feasibility of a randomized trial 
      to answer this question, we emulated a target trial of physical activity 
      strategies based on current clinical guidelines and 6-year quality of life using 
      observational data from 1,549 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study 
      diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 2004-2016. Eligible 
      individuals were free of conditions that may preclude high levels of physical 
      activity at baseline. We estimated 6-year mean physical quality of life scores 
      (based on EPIC-CP symptom domains; range: 1-12, lower is better) under sustained, 
      dynamic physical activity strategies, adjusting for baseline and time-varying 
      variables using the parametric g-formula. Estimated 6-year mean differences 
      (adherence to physical activity recommendations vs. non-adherence) were 0.1 (95% 
      confidence interval: 0.0,0.2) for bowel symptoms, -0.1 (-0.2,0.1) for urinary 
      incontinence, 0.0 (-0.1,0.2) for urinary irritation/obstruction, -0.3 (-0.7,0.1) 
      for sexual symptoms, and -0.1 (-0.2,0.1) for vitality/hormonal symptoms. 
      Estimated 6-year mean differences comparing adherence to physical activity 
      recommendations vs. no intervention (observed physical activity in this 
      population) were close to zero. Adhering to current physical activity 
      recommendations may help to improve 6-year symptoms in the sexual domain, with 
      little expected influence on symptoms in the bowel, urinary, and 
      vitality/hormonal domains.

TI  - Association between dementia and left atrial appendage occlusion in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation: A TriNetX-based retrospective cohort study with target trial 
      emulation.
PG  - 151-158
LID - 10.1016/j.hroo.2024.11.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia linked to an 
      elevated risk of stroke and dementia. Emerging observational evidence suggests 
      that left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) may reduce the risk of dementia in 
      patients with AF; however, further research is required to confirm this potential 
      benefit. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of LAAO vs 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in reducing the risk of dementia in patients 
      with AF. METHODS: We conducted target trial emulation using data from the TriNetX 
      research network. Patients with AF were allocated to 2 cohorts (2270 patients in 
      each one), treated either with LAAO or with DOACs, and balanced with propensity 
      score matching. The primary end points were composite dementia, vascular 
      dementia, and Alzheimer disease. Secondary end points included mortality, 
      ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and major adverse cardiovascular 
      events. Follow-up was conducted over 3 years. RESULTS: At 3-year follow-up, the 
      risk of composite dementia was lower in the LAAO group than in the DOAC group 
      (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.85). Subgroup analyses 
      demonstrated consistent results, favoring the LAAO group. No significant 
      differences were observed in the incidence of secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: 
      This real-world study suggests that LAAO is associated with a lower risk of 
      dementia in patients with AF compared with DOACs. Further prospective research 
      with long-term follow-up is needed to validate our findings in the population 
      with AF.

      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel in older patients 
      with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). We aimed to assess the risk of major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (MACE) and major bleeding in ACS patients ≥75 years 
      initiating ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used 
      healthcare data from the Stockholm region (2011-2021) to emulate a hypothetical 
      target trial comparing ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel. MACE was defined as composite 
      of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke. Patients were followed 
      for 12 months. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for 
      46 baseline confounders. We used weighted Cox proportional hazards regression to 
      estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the weighted 
      Aalen-Johansen estimator to estimate absolute risks (AR).Among 4,637 older 
      patients (median age 81 years [IQR 77-85]), 49% initiated DAPT with ticagrelor 
      and 51% with clopidogrel. After weighting, all confounders were balanced. 
      Ticagrelor was associated with a lower one-year MACE risk than clopidogrel (11.1% 
      vs. 14.9%), corresponding to an AR difference of -3.8% (95%CI -6.8, -0.8). The HR 
      for ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel was 0.73 (95%CI 0.56-0.95). There was no 
      difference in the risk of major bleeding with one-year ARs of 4.3% with 
      ticagrelor vs. 4.8% with clopidogrel, and a HR of 0.89 (95%CI 0.63-1.27). 
      CONCLUSION: In ACS patients aged ≥75 years, ticagrelor was associated with a 
      lower risk of MACE than clopidogrel. There was no differences in major bleeding, 
      although confidence interval was wide.

TI  - Impact of enhanced pain knowledge on core outcomes in fibromyalgia patients with 
      high self-reported pain education needs: a target trial emulation using the 
      DANFIB registry.
LID - 10.1136/rmdopen-2025-005576 [doi]
LID - e005576
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Relationships between patient education and long-term clinical 
      outcomes are complex. This study used real-world data to evaluate the impact of 
      improved pain knowledge on clinical outcomes in fibromyalgia patients. METHODS: 
      Prospectively collected registry-based observational data were analysed to 
      emulate a randomised clinical trial. Study participants were diagnosed with 
      fibromyalgia, had a high need to learn about pain (Numeric Rating Scale >7), had 
      attended a 2-day therapeutic educational programme and re-rated their learning 
      needs after the programme. A good educational outcome was defined as a re-rating 
      score <5, while a poor outcome was ≥5. The primary endpoint at 9 months was the 
      overall impact of fibromyalgia, measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire 
      Revised (FIQR) impact subscale. RESULTS: The eligible cohort comprised 450 
      participants. The intention-to-treat from population included 121 participants 
      (26.9%) with a good educational outcome and 329 participants (73.1%) with a poor 
      educational outcome (comparator group). Missing outcome data were handled 
      implicitly by the repeated measures linear mixed models, assuming data are 
      missing at random.At the 9-month endpoint, the fully adjusted FIQR impact 
      subscale score was lower in the good educational outcome group (8.0 (95% CI 7.3 
      to 8.7)) compared with the poor educational outcome group (9.6 (95% CI 9.0 to 
      10.2)), indicating a better clinical outcome for those with a good educational 
      outcome. The model-estimated between-group difference was -1.6 (95% CI -2.5 to 
      -0.7; p=0.0006) FIQR impact subscale units. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that 
      achieving pain educational learning objectives leads to better clinical outcomes 
      in fibromyalgia patients, supporting the integration of pain education into 
      patient programmes.

TI  - Real-World Harm Reduction of Metformin Plus DPP4 Inhibitors versus Metformin Plus 
      Sulfonylureas in Older Adults: A Target Trial Emulation Using German Claims Data.
PG  - 655-663
LID - 10.1007/s40266-025-01218-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study complements evidence from randomized controlled trials on 
      the harms (e.g., hypoglycemia) of sulfonylureas compared with dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in older 
      adults using real-world data. Existing evidence suggests an increased risk of 
      hypoglycemia, falls, fractures, and cardiovascular events. METHODS: Using target 
      trial emulation, we analyzed a retrospective cohort drawn from German routine 
      claims data. We included patients older than 65 years who initiated DPP4i 
      (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, or saxagliptin) or sulfonylureas (glibenclamid or 
      glimepirid) as add on to metformin between 2011 and 2018. Confounding was 
      adjusted for through overlap weighting, and the average treatment effects were 
      estimated in the overlap population using generalized linear models. RESULTS: 
      Among 171,318 eligible patients, 111,865 (65%) received DPP4i and 59,453 (35%) 
      sulfonylureas. Patients treated with DPP4i had a higher prevalence of all 
      observed comorbidities. Applying overlap weights to adjust for confounding, 
      patients treated with DPP4i had a higher rate of combined all-cause 
      hospitalizations and outpatient visits compared with those treated with 
      sulfonylureas (rate ratio = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.03) in the total population. In 
      contrast, we found a protective effect of DPP4i on the risk for severe 
      hypoglycemia in the subgroups of new users (ratio rate (RR) = 0.51, 95% CI 0.33, 
      0.76) and patients with severe renal insufficiency (RR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.16, 
      0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Deprescribing sulfonylureas and using DPP4i instead may 
      slightly reduce harm in some subgroups of older adults, which supports 
      recommendations of existing lists of potentially inappropriate medications.

TI  - Early fungal colonization and infection as an independent predictor of 
      in-hospital mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients: A nationwide 
      target trial emulation study in Taiwan.
PG  - 102767
LID - S1876-0341(25)00116-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jiph.2025.102767 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of fungal colonization and infection phenotypes 
      and other prognostic factors on in-hospital mortality among mechanically 
      ventilated COVID-19 patients (n = 376) admitted to ICUs during the first wave of 
      the pandemic in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A target trial emulation framework 
      was used to minimize immortal time bias. Patients were matched 1:1:2 for age and 
      gender and classified into three groups: 94 in the "Early" group (fungal 
      colonization or infection within 10 days), 94 in the "Late" group (10-30 days), 
      and 188 in the "No" group (no fungal colonization or infection within 30 days). 
      In-hospital mortality and clinical outcomes were compared across groups. RESULTS: 
      Patients in the "Early" group received higher cumulative corticosteroid doses, 
      had lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios, and exhibited higher rates of comorbidities, 
      cytomegalovirus viremia, and lung, heart, and kidney complications. They also had 
      a longer duration of ventilator use, ICU stay, and total hospitalization compared 
      to the "Late" and "No" groups. Time-dependent multivariate Cox regression 
      analysis identified the "Early" phenotype as a strong predictor of in-hospital 
      mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]= 3.992, 95 % CI: 2.676-5.956, p < 0.001). 
      Additional independent risk factors included Charlson Comorbidity Index (aHR = 
      1.213, 95 % CI: 1.113-1.323, p < 0.001) and APACHE II score (aHR = 1.028, 95 % 
      CI: 1.011-1.045, p = 0.001). In contrast, higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios (aHR = 
      0.998, 95 % CI: 0.997-1.000, p = 0.021) and ganciclovir use (aHR = 0.419, 95 % 
      CI: 0.245-0.717, p = 0.002) were associated with reduced mortality. CONCLUSIONS: 
      "Early" fungal colonization and infection within 10 days of corticosteroid 
      initiation is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in 
      mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Future research should explore early 
      intervention strategies, including antifungal prophylaxis, optimized 
      corticosteroid dosing, and immune modulation, to improve survival outcomes.

TI  - Vaccine Effectiveness Among 5- to 17-year-old Individuals with Prior SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection: An EHR-Based Target Trial Emulation Study from the RECOVER Project.
LID - 2025.02.07.25321814 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2025.02.07.25321814 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of COVID-19 
      vaccines in children and adolescents. However, the benefits of vaccination in 
      these age groups with prior infection remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing reinfection with 
      various Omicron subvariants (BA.1/2, BA.4/5, XBB, and later) among 5- to 
      17-year-olds with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: A target trial emulation 
      through nested designs with distinct study periods. SETTING: The study utilized 
      data from the Research COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) initiative, a national 
      electronic health record (EHR) database comprising 37 U.S. children's hospitals 
      and health institutions. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 5-17 years with a 
      documented history of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the study start date during a 
      specific variant-dominant period (Delta, BA.1/2, or BA.4/5) who received a 
      subsequent dose of COVID-19 vaccine during the study periods were compared with 
      those with a documented history of infection who did not receive SARS-CoV-2 
      vaccine during the study period. Those infected within the Delta-Omicron 
      composite period (December 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021) were excluded. The 
      study period was from January 1, 2022, to August 30, 2023, and focused on 
      adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and children aged 5 to 11 years. EXPOSURES: At 
      least received one COVID-19 vaccination during the study period vs. no receipt of 
      any COVID-19 vaccine during the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome is documented SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during the study period 
      (both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases). The effectiveness of the COVID-19 
      vaccine was estimated as (1- hazard ratio) *100%, with confounders adjusted by a 
      combination of propensity score matching and exact matching. RESULTS: The study 
      analyzed 87,573 participants during the BA.1/2 period, 229,326 during the BA.4/5 
      period, and 282,981 during the XBB or later period. Among vaccinated individuals, 
      significant protection was observed during the BA.1/2 period, with effectiveness 
      rates of 62% (95% CI: 38%-77%) for children and 65% (95% CI: 32%-81%) for 
      adolescents. During the BA.4/5 period, vaccine effectiveness was 57% (95% CI: 
      25%-76%) for children, but not statistically significant for adolescents (36%, 
      95% CI: -16%-65%). For the XBB period, no significant protection was observed in 
      either group, with effectiveness rates of 22% (95% CI: -36%-56%) in children and 
      34% (95% CI: -10%-61%) in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: COVID-19 
      vaccination provides significant protection against reinfection for children and 
      adolescents with prior infections during the early and mid-Omicron periods. This 
      study also highlights the importance of addressing low vaccination rates in 
      pediatric populations to enhance protection against emerging variants.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Long-Acting Lipoglycopeptides vs Standard-of-Care 
      Antibiotics in Serious Bacterial Infections.
PG  - e2511641
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.11641 [doi]
LID - e2511641
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Serious bacterial infections such as bacteremia, endocarditis, 
      osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis typically require prolonged intravenous 
      antibiotics. Long-acting lipoglycopeptides (laLGPs), such as dalbavancin and 
      oritavancin, offer extended treatment intervals for gram-positive infections that 
      may benefit populations with barriers to traditional treatment, including persons 
      who use drugs (PWUD individuals). OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of 
      laLGPs in managing serious bacterial infections in both PWUD and non-PWUD 
      populations compared with standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study using a target trial 
      emulation framework included data extracted from the US Cerner Real World Data 
      platform. Individuals hospitalized and discharged for serious bacterial 
      infections between October 1, 2015, and October 1, 2022, were included in the 
      analysis. Data were analyzed from July 7, 2023, to February 28, 2025. 
      INTERVENTION: Receipt of an laLGP (dalbavancin or oritavancin) vs SOC 
      antibiotics. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was a 
      composite of readmission, emergency department visit, and inpatient death or 
      discharge to hospice within 90 days post discharge from the index admission. 
      Analyses were stratified by PWUD and non-PWUD status. Clone censor weighting was 
      used to emulate a per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) of time to the 
      composite event and 95% CIs were calculated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Among 
      42 067 included individuals, median age was 61 (IQR, 47-73) years, 24 704 were 
      male (58.7%), and 5047 (12.0%) were classified as PWUD. laLGPs were prescribed in 
      825 individuals (2.0%). There was no statistically significant difference in the 
      composite outcome between the laLGP and SOC groups in both the PWUD (HR, 1.01; 
      95% CI, 0.88-1.13) and non-PWUD (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86-1.00) participants. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of laLGPs vs SOC, findings suggested 
      that laLGPs were effective as step-down treatment of serious gram-positive 
      bacterial infections, offering comparable outcomes to those of SOC antibiotics in 
      PWUD and non-PWUD individuals. Clinicians may consider laLGPs as alternative 
      step-down options to SOC antibiotics for the treatment of serious gram-positive 
      bacterial infections.

TI  - Stopping mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists after hyperkalaemia: trial 
      emulation in data from routine care.
PG  - 1698-1707
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.2287 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Whether to continue or stop mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) 
      after an episode of hyperkalaemia is a challenge in clinical practice. While 
      stopping MRA may prevent recurrent hyperkalaemias, it deprives patients of their 
      cardioprotection. We here assessed the association between stopping vs. 
      continuing MRA therapy after hyperkalaemia and the subsequent risks of adverse 
      health events. METHODS AND RESULTS: Observational study from the Stockholm 
      CREAtinine Measurements (SCREAM) project 2006-2018. We identified patients 
      initiating MRA and surviving a first-detected episode of hyperkalaemia (plasma 
      potassium >5.0 mmol/L). Using target trial emulation methods, we assessed the 
      association between stopping vs. continuing MRA within 6 months after 
      hyperkalaemia and subsequent outcomes. The primary outcome was the composite of 
      hospital admission with heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. 
      The secondary outcome was occurrence of another hyperkalaemia event. Among 39 518 
      patients initiating MRA, we identified 7366 who developed hyperkalaemia. Median 
      age was 76 years, 45% were women and 69% had a history of heart failure. 
      Following hyperkalaemia, 2222 (30%) discontinued treatment. Compared with 
      continuing MRA, stopping therapy was associated with a lower 2-year risk of 
      recurrent hyperkalaemia [hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.72-0.79], but a higher risk of the primary outcome (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14). 
      Similar results were observed in patients with heart failure, after censoring 
      when treatment decision was changed, and across pre-specified subgroups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Stopping MRA after an episode of hyperkalaemia was associated with 
      reduced risk for recurrent hyperkalaemia, but higher risk of death or 
      cardiovascular events. Recurrent hyperkalaemia was common in either strategy.

TI  - Methodologies for the Emulation of Biomarker-Guided Trials Using Observational 
      Data: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/jpm15050195 [doi]
LID - 195
AB  - Background: Target trial emulation involves the application of design principles 
      from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to observational data, and is 
      particularly useful in situations where an RCT would be unfeasible. 
      Biomarker-guided trials, which incorporate biomarkers within their design to 
      either guide treatment and/or determine eligibility, are often unfeasible in 
      practice due to sample size requirements or ethical concerns. Here, we undertake 
      a systematic review of methodologies used in target trial emulations, comparing 
      treatment effectiveness, critically appraising them, and considering their 
      applicability to the emulation of biomarker-guided trials. Methods: A 
      comprehensive search strategy was developed to identify studies reporting on 
      methods for target trial emulation comparing the effectiveness of treatments 
      using observational data, and applied to the following bibliographic databases: 
      PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Ovid MEDLINE. A narrative description of 
      methods identified in the review was undertaken alongside a critique of their 
      relative strengths and limitations. Results: We identified a total of 59 papers: 
      47 emulating a target trial ('application' studies), and 12 detailing methods to 
      emulate a target trial ('methods' studies). A total of 25 papers were identified 
      as emulating a biomarker-guided trial (42%). While all papers reported methods to 
      adjust for baseline confounding, 40% of application papers did not specify 
      methods to adjust for time-varying confounding. Conclusions: This systematic 
      review has identified a range of methods used to control for baseline, 
      time-varying, and residual/unmeasured confounding within target trial emulation 
      and provides a guide for researchers interested in emulation of biomarker-guided 
      trials.

TI  - Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy vs Up-Front Surgery for Resectable Locally Advanced 
      Rectal Cancer.
PG  - e259049
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.9049 [doi]
LID - e259049
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Guidelines for resectable locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) 
      advocate for neoadjuvant radiotherapy (NRT) followed by surgery as the standard 
      approach. However, recent trials have reported no oncological benefits of 
      NRT-based therapy for middle or lower rectal cancer, raising the question of 
      whether NRT followed by surgery remains the optimal treatment approach for 
      resectable LARC overall. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of NRT followed by 
      surgery vs up-front surgery for resectable LARC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study, using a target trial emulation framework with 
      nationwide registries in Taiwan, included patients undergoing curative resection 
      for resectable LARC (cT1-2N1-2, cT3Nany) between January 1, 2014, and December 
      31, 2017, with follow-up until December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from January 
      1, 2024, to February 15, 2025. EXPOSURE: NRT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and local recurrence (LR). The 
      secondary outcome was intraoperative diverting stoma outcomes. RESULTS: A total 
      of 4099 patients were analyzed, including 1436 patients undergoing NRT followed 
      by surgery (median [IQR] age, 62.0 [53.0-71.0] years; 1036 [72.1%] male) and 2663 
      patients undergoing up-front surgery (median [IQR] age, 65.0 [56.0-74.0] years; 
      1626 [61.1%] male). NRT followed by surgery, compared with up-front surgery, was 
      associated with higher 3-year OS rates (88.5% vs 85.2%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 
      95% CI, 0.59-0.92) but higher permanent diverting stoma rates (20.6% vs 11.1%; 
      relative risk [RR], 1.91; 95% CI, 1.62-2.25); LR rates were not significantly 
      different (5.7% vs 6.6%; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.55-1.11). Subgroup analysis revealed 
      that compared with up-front surgery, NRT followed by surgery was associated with 
      improved outcomes in middle or lower rectal cancer but not upper rectal cancer 
      (OS: HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.82-2.90; LR: HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.23-5.00). NRT followed 
      by surgery was associated with significantly increased risks of permanent 
      diverting stomas across different tumor heights, particularly in upper rectal 
      cancer (RR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.44-8.69). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort 
      study of nationwide registries in Taiwan, NRT followed by surgery was associated 
      with improved oncological outcomes for overall resectable LARC, with excessive 
      diverting stoma nonreversal as the trade-off. However, the benefits of NRT were 
      not observed for upper rectal cancer. These findings raise concerns about 
      potential harm from NRT and advise caution when performing NRT for upper rectal 
      cancer.

TI  - Thirty-Five-Year Follow-Up Real-World Data Revealed the Efficacy of Autologous 
      Formalin-Fixed Tumor Vaccine on Metastatic Breast Cancer-A Target Trial 
      Emulation.
LID - S1526-8209(25)00178-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clbc.2025.06.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The prognosis after distant metastasis of breast cancer 
      is generally poor. We analyzed the effect of an autologous formalin-fixed tumor 
      vaccine (AFTV) on postoperative breast cancer using 35-year follow-up real-world 
      data in a concurrent cohort and a target trial emulation, a similar method to the 
      randomized study. The sample (n = 698) was narrowed to cases with distant 
      metastasis, resulting in a cohort of 94 patients. In this study, meta-OS refers 
      to overall survival after distant metastasis. RESULTS: Treatment with AFTV 
      significantly prolonged meta-OS. The median meta-OS was 4.58 years for the AFTV 
      group (n = 59) compared to 2.81 years for the control group (n = 35), with a 
      significant difference (P = .0300). Radiotherapy (RT), a stratified factor, also 
      extended meta-OS, although no superiority was observed between AFTV therapy and 
      RT in multivariable regression analysis. The combination of AFTV therapy and RT 
      demonstrated a synergistic effect in prolonging meta-OS (P = .0320). Chemotherapy 
      (Chemo) alone showed no significant effect on meta-OS in the control group but 
      shortened meta-OS in the AFTV group, if administered within 6 months of AFTV 
      treatment (P = .0478). Treating after distant metastasis, the "Optimum AFTV Set" 
      subgroup (AFTV therapy plus RT without Chemo within 6 months, n = 13) extracted 
      from the AFTV group had a median meta-OS of 12.85 years, showing a significant 
      improvement compared to the corresponding control subgroup (RT without Chemo 
      within 6 months) (n = 6, P = .00819). The 10-year survival rate after distant 
      metastasis was 25.6% in the AFTV group, 7.4% in the control group, 53.8% in the 
      Optimum AFTV Set subgroup, and 0% in the corresponding control subgroup. All 
      AFTV-related adverse events were classified as CTCAE grade 2 or lower. 
      DISCUSSION: The results of Optimum AFTV Set therapy provide a strong rationale 
      for a larger-scale prospective randomized study. CONCLUSION: The present 
      real-world data suggest that Optimum AFTV Set therapy may be a useful option for 
      treatment following the detection of distant metastasis after breast cancer 
      surgery.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Nonsteroid Immunosuppressive Medications in Childhood 
      Nephrotic Syndrome.
PG  - 321-331
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.5286 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cyclophosphamide and calcineurin inhibitors are the most used 
      nonsteroid immunosuppressive medications globally for children with various 
      chronic inflammatory conditions. Their comparative effectiveness remains 
      uncertain, leading to worldwide practice variation. Nephrotic syndrome is the 
      most common kidney disease managed by pediatricians globally and suboptimal 
      treatment is associated with high morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      comparative effectiveness of cyclophosphamide vs calcineurin inhibitors 
      (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) for childhood nephrotic syndrome relapse prevention. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using target trial emulation methods, the 
      study team emulated a pragmatic, open-label clinical trial using available data 
      from the Insight Into Nephrotic Syndrome: Investigating Genes, Health, and 
      Therapeutics (INSIGHT) study. INSIGHT is a multicenter, prospective cohort study 
      in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Participants included children (1 to 18 
      years) with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome diagnosed between 1996 and 2019 
      from the Greater Toronto Area, who initiated cyclophosphamide or a calcineurin 
      inhibitor treatment. Data analysis was performed in 2024. EXPOSURES: Incident 
      cyclophosphamide or calcineurin inhibitor treatment. Randomization was emulated 
      by overlap weighting of propensity scores for treatment assignment. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was time to relapse, analyzed by weighted 
      Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Secondary outcomes included 
      relapse rates, subsequent immunosuppression, kidney function, hypertension, 
      adverse events, and quality of life. RESULTS: Of 578 children (median age at 
      diagnosis, 3.7 [IQR, 2.8-6.0] years; 371 male [64%] and 207 female [36%]), 252 
      initiated cyclophosphamide, 131 initiated calcineurin inhibitors, and 87 
      sequentially initiated both medications. Baseline characteristics were well 
      balanced after propensity score weighting. During median 5.5-year (quarter 1 to 
      quarter 3, 2.5-9.2) follow-up, there was no significant difference in time to 
      relapse between calcineurin inhibitor vs cyclophosphamide treatment (hazard ratio 
      [HR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.84-1.87). Relapses were more common after calcineurin 
      inhibitor treatment than cyclophosphamide (85% vs 73%) in the weighted cohorts, 
      but not statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in 
      subsequent relapse rates, nonsteroid immunosuppression use, or kidney function 
      between medications. Calcineurin inhibitor treatment was associated with more 
      hospitalizations (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.14-2.92) and intravenous albumin use (HR, 
      2.81; 95% CI, 1.65-4.81). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, there was no 
      evidence of difference in time to relapse after cyclophosphamide and calcineurin 
      inhibitor treatment in children with nephrotic syndrome. Cyclophosphamide 
      treatment is shorter in duration and more accessible globally than calcineurin 
      inhibitors.

TI  - Cumulative Incidence of Thiazide-Induced Hyponatremia : A Population-Based Cohort 
      Study.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.7326/M23-1989 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to drug labels, the frequency of thiazide-induced 
      hyponatremia is unknown or uncommon to very rare (that is, <1 in 10 000 to <1 in 
      100), but the exact burden remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the increase 
      in the cumulative incidence of hyponatremia using thiazide diuretics compared 
      with nonthiazide antihypertensive drugs in routine clinical practice. DESIGN: 
      Population and register-based cohort study using target trial emulation. SETTING: 
      Denmark, 1 January 2014 to 31 October 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Two target trials were 
      emulated among persons aged 40 years or older who had no recent prescription for 
      any antihypertensive drug, had no previous hyponatremia, and were eligible for 
      the studied antihypertensive treatments. The first target trial emulation 
      compared new use of bendroflumethiazide (BFZ) versus a calcium-channel blocker 
      (CCB). The second target trial emulation compared new use of hydrochlorothiazide 
      plus a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (HCTZ-RASi; that is, combination pill) 
      versus a RASi alone. MEASUREMENTS: Two-year cumulative incidences of sodium 
      levels less than 130 mmol/L using stabilized inverse probability of 
      treatment-weighted survival curves. RESULTS: The study compared 37 786 new users 
      of BFZ with 44 963 of a CCB and 11 943 new users of HCTZ-RASi with 85 784 of a 
      RASi. The 2-year cumulative incidences of hyponatremia were 3.83% for BFZ and 
      3.51% for HCTZ-RASi. The risk differences were 1.35% (95% CI, 1.04% to 1.66%) 
      between BFZ and CCB and 1.38% (CI, 1.01% to 1.75%) between HCTZ-RASi and RASi; 
      risk differences were higher with older age and higher comorbidity burden. The 
      respective hazard ratios were 3.56 (CI, 2.76 to 4.60) and 4.25 (CI, 3.23 to 5.59) 
      during the first 30 days since treatment initiation and 1.26 (CI, 1.09 to 1.46) 
      and 1.29 (CI, 1.05 to 1.58) after 1 year. LIMITATION: The study assumed that 
      filled prescriptions equaled drug use, and residual confounding is likely. 
      CONCLUSION: Treatment initiation with thiazide diuretics suggests a more 
      substantial excess risk for hyponatremia, particularly during the first months of 
      treatment, than indicated by drug labeling. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Independent

TI  - Real-World Effectiveness of Nirmatrelvir in Protecting Long COVID for Outpatient 
      Adult Patients - A Large-Scale Observational Cohort Study from the RECOVER 
      Initiative.

AB  - Paxlovid has been approved for use in patients who are at high risk for severe 
      acute COVID-19 illness. Evidence regarding whether Paxlovid protects against 
      Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or Long COVID, is mixed in 
      high-risk patients and lacking in low-risk patients. With a target trial 
      emulation framework, we evaluated the association of Paxlovid treatment within 5 
      days of SARS-CoV-2 infection with incident Long COVID and hospitalization or 
      death from any cause in the post-acute period (30-180 days after infection) using 
      electronic health records from the Patient-Centered Clinical Research Networks 
      (PCORnet) RECOVER repository. The study population included 497,499 SARS-CoV-2 
      positive patients between March 1, 2022, to February 1, 2023, and among which 
      165,256 were treated with Paxlovid within 5 days since infection and 307,922 were 
      not treated with Paxlovid or other COVID-19 treatments. Compared with the 
      non-treated group, Paxlovid treatment was associated with reduced risk of Long 
      COVID with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87 to 0.89) and absolute risk 
      reduction of 2.99 events per 100 persons (95% CI, 2.65 to 3.32). Paxlovid 
      treatment was associated with reduced risk of all-cause death (HR, 0.53, 95% CI 
      0.46 to 0.60; risk reduction 0.23 events per 100 persons, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.28) 
      and hospitalization (HR, 0.70, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.73; risk reduction 2.37 events 
      per 100 persons, 95% CI 2.19 to 2.56) in the post-acute phase. For those without 
      documented risk factors, the associations (HR, 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; risk 
      increase 0.80 events per 100 persons, 95% CI -0.84 to 2.45) were inconclusive. 
      Overall, high-risk, nonhospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who were treated 
      with Paxlovid within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection had a lower risk of Long 
      COVID and all-cause hospitalization or death in the post-acute period. However, 
      Long COVID risk reduction with Paxlovid was not observed in low-risk patients.

      health interventions.
PG  - 1765-1775
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.13892 [doi]
AB  - BACKROUND: The evidence base for interventions for child mental health and 
      neurodevelopment is weak and the current capacity for rigorous evaluation 
      limited. We describe some of the challenges that make this field particularly 
      difficult and expensive for evaluation studies. METHODS: We describe and review 
      the use of novel study designs and analysis methodology for their potential to 
      improve this situation. RESULTS: While several novel designs appeared ill-suited 
      to our field, systematic review found others that offered potential but had yet 
      to be widely adopted, some not at all. CONCLUSIONS: While funding is inevitably a 
      constraint, we argue that improvements in the evidence base of both current and 
      new treatments will only be achieved by the adoption of a number of these new 
      technologies and study designs, the consistent application of rigorous 
      constructive but demanding standards, and the engagement of the public, patients, 
      clinical and research services to build a design, recruitment, and analysis 
      infrastructure.

TI  - Comparative Safety of Antidepressants in Adults with CKD.
PG  - 178-188
LID - 10.2215/CJN.0000000000000348 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is prevalent in patients with CKD and is related to poor 
      prognosis. Despite the widespread use of antidepressants in the CKD population, 
      their safety remains unclear. METHODS: We identified adults with CKD stages G3-5 
      (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 not treated with dialysis) and incident depression 
      diagnosis during 2007-2019 from the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements project. 
      Using the target trial emulation framework, we compared the following treatment 
      strategies: ( 1 ) initiating versus not initiating antidepressants, ( 2 ) 
      initiating mirtazapine versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
      and ( 3 ) initiating SSRIs with a lower dose versus a standard dose. RESULTS: Of 
      7798 eligible individuals, 5743 (74%) initiated antidepressant treatment. 
      Compared with noninitiation, initiation of antidepressants was associated with 
      higher hazards of short-term outcomes, including hip fracture (hazard ratio [HR], 
      1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 1.74) and upper gastrointestinal 
      bleeding (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.82 to 2.31), although not statistically 
      significant. Initiation of antidepressants was not associated with long-term 
      outcomes, including all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular event, CKD 
      progression, and suicidal behavior. Compared with SSRIs, initiation of 
      mirtazapine was associated with a lower hazard of upper gastrointestinal bleeding 
      (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.96), but a higher hazard of mortality (HR, 1.11; 95% 
      CI, 1.00 to 1.22). Compared with the standard dose, initiation of SSRIs with a 
      lower dose was associated with nonstatistically significantly lower hazards of 
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.34) and CKD 
      progression (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.02), but a higher hazard of cardiac 
      arrest (HR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.40). CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant treatment 
      was associated with short-term adverse outcomes but not long-term outcomes in 
      people with CKD and depression.

AB  - Objective: To explore the progress and trend in research of target trial 
      emulation (TTE) and provide reference for research in this field. Methods: A 
      literature retrival of research papers in this field published as of November 30, 
      2024 was conducted based on three databases (i.e. PubMed, Web of Science, and 
      Scopus). The papers which were highly cited were analyzed by Bibliometrix package 
      in R 4.3.2. The co-occurrence network of keywords were analyzed by using software 
      VOSviewer. The keyword burst test was carried out with software CiteSpace. 
      Results: A total of 685 papers from 314 journals were included. The annual number 
      of the papers published showed a significant growth in recent three years. JAMA 
      Network Open had the highest publication mumber related to TTE (34 papers), 
      Annals of Internal Medicine had the highest H-index and American Journal of 
      Epidemiology had the highest total citations. In the 2 997 authors, Hernán MA 
      made a greatest contribution. In the 2 046 institutions, Harvard Medical School 
      was at leading position. The analysis on highly cited papers and keyword 
      co-occurrence showed that TTE was mainly used in the studies of COVID-19 vaccine, 
      cancer and the treatment efficacy and safety of chronic diseases. The analysis on 
      the co-occurence of keyword burst test showed that keywords frequently used until 
      2024 were COVID-19 vaccine, cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. 
      Conclusions: TTE is mainly used in the studies of public health emergency (such 
      as COVID-19), patients with cancer and chronic diseases. TTE will play a crucial 
      role when randomized controlled trial is difficult to conduct or current evidence 
      requirement can not be met.

AB  - This article provides a critical review of existing research on intimate 
      (marriage or marriage-like) relationship distress and risk for depression. Using 
      the meta-framework of research triangulation, we seek to synthesize research 
      evidence across several different methodologies and study designs and to draw the 
      most reliable conclusion regarding a potential causal association between 
      relationship distress and depression. Focusing on existing correlational (i.e., 
      observational), genetically informed, and intervention (i.e., experimental) 
      research on the association between relationship distress and depression, we 
      conclude that the existing body of research evidence supports the claim that 
      relationship distress is a causal risk factor for depression. A secondary aim of 
      the article is to highlight a variety of effective methods that, when viewed from 
      the perspective of triangulation, enhance the pursuit of causal inference, 
      including propensity score matching, target trial emulation, directed acyclic 
      graph approach, and Mendelian randomization.

TI  - Emulating a Target Trial of Shorter Compared to Longer Course of Antibiotic 
      Therapy for Gram-Negative Bacteremia.
PG  - 292-300
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciad670 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of antimicrobial therapies, gram-negative 
      bacteremia remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality on a global 
      level. Recent randomized controlled trials support shorter antibiotic treatment 
      duration for individuals with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia. The target 
      trial framework using the cloning approach utilizes real-world data but 
      eliminates the issue of immortal time bias seen in observational studies by 
      emulating the analysis of randomized trials with full adherence. METHOD: A 
      hypothetical target trial allocating individuals with gram-negative bacteremia to 
      either short antibiotic treatment duration (5-7 days) or longer antibiotic 
      treatment duration (8-14 days) was specified and emulated using the cloning, 
      censoring, and weighting approach. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause 
      mortality. Secondary outcome was a composite endpoint of clinical and 
      microbiological relapse. The emulated trial included individuals from four 
      hospitals in Copenhagen from 2018 through 2021. RESULTS: In sum, 1040 individuals 
      were included. The median age of the cohort was 76 years, the majority were male 
      (54%), had community-acquired gram-negative bacteremia (86%), urinary tract 
      infection as the source of the infection (78%), and Escherichia coli as the 
      pathogen of the infection (73%). The adjusted 90-day risk difference in all-cause 
      mortality was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -.7, 3.3), and the risk ratio 
      was 1.12 (95% CI: .89, 1.37). The adjusted 90-day risk difference in relapse was 
      0.7% (95% CI: -2.3, 3.8), and the risk ratio was 1.07 (95% CI: .71, 1.45). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We found comparative outcomes for shorter treatment duration 
      compared to longer treatment duration in patients with gram-negative bacteremia.

TI  - Emulations of oncology trials using real-world data: a systematic literature 
      review.
PG  - 1783-1793
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae346 [doi]
AB  - By evaluating published emulations of oncology randomized control trial (RCT) 
      studies in which both the active and comparator groups are sourced from 
      real-world data (RWD) and target trial results are available for benchmarking, 
      this systematic review aims to gain insight into factors related to emulation 
      performance. Thirteen oncology emulation studies using various types of RWD were 
      identified through an online database search of PubMed through 2022. Based on the 
      ROBINS-I tool, most studies (n = 8) had a serious risk of overall bias driven by 
      risk of bias from confounding. Approximately half of the studies (n = 6) fully 
      proxied the RCT entry criteria. Of 11 RWD studies that provided sufficient detail 
      to quantify emulation performance, the emulation hazard ratio (HR) estimate fell 
      within the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the trial estimate in 9 of the 
      studies. There were no clear trends between risk of bias or degree to which the 
      entry criteria were proxied and emulation performance. Findings may have been 
      influenced by publication bias and researcher degrees of freedom, as only one 
      emulation study preregistered its protocol. Tools for comprehensively 
      characterizing factors that affect emulation performance, including the 
      real-world clinical context as it relates to the RCT research question, are 
      needed to evaluate the feasibility of a RCT emulation. This article is part of a 
      Special Collection on Pharmacoepidemiology.

TI  - Adjuvant Ovarian Function Suppression in Premenopausal Hormone Receptor-Positive 
      Breast Cancer.
PG  - e242082
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.2082 [doi]
LID - e242082
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Few oncology studies have assessed the effectiveness of adjuvant 
      ovarian function suppression (OFS) in observational settings for premenopausal 
      hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Target trial emulation is increasingly 
      used for estimating treatment outcomes in observational cohorts. OBJECTIVES: To 
      describe hormone therapy and OFS treatment patterns (aim 1), examine the 
      association between adding OFS to tamoxifen (TAM) or aromatase inhibitor (AI) and 
      survival (aim 2), and examine the association between duration of hormone 
      treatment (TAM or AI) plus OFS (H-OFS) and survival (aim 3). DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study included all premenopausal, 
      early-stage breast cancer diagnoses between 2010 and 2020 in Alberta, Canada. 
      Target trial emulation was conducted. Eligibility criteria were directly modeled 
      after the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) and Tamoxifen and 
      Exemestane Trial (TEXT). Participants were followed up for a maximum of 5 years. 
      Data were analyzed from July 2022 through March 2023. EXPOSURES: For aim 2, 
      exposures were receiving the following baseline treatments for 2 years: AI + OFS 
      (AI-OFS), TAM + OFS (T-OFS), and TAM alone. For aim 3, exposures were a 2-year or 
      greater and a less than 2-year duration of H-OFS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Recurrence-free survival was the primary outcome of interest. Marginal structural 
      Cox models with inverse probability treatment and censoring weights were used to 
      estimate hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for baseline and time-varying confounding 
      variables. RESULTS: Among 3434 female patients with premenopausal, early-stage 
      breast cancer diagnoses (median [IQR] age, 45 [40-48] years), 2647 individuals 
      satisfied SOFT and TEXT eligibility criteria. There were 2260 patients who 
      initiated TAM, 232 patients who initiated T-OFS, and 155 patients who initiated 
      AI-OFS; 192 patients received H-OFS for 2 or more years, and 195 patients 
      received H-OFS for less than 2 years. The 5-year recurrence risks were not 
      significantly lower in AI-OFS vs TAM (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.38-1.33) or T-OFS vs 
      TAM (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.50-1.45) groups. Patients receiving H-OFS for 2 or more 
      years had significantly better 5-year recurrence-free survival compared with 
      those receiving H-OFS for less than 2 years (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found no significant reductions in 
      recurrence risk for AI-OFS and T-OFS compared with TAM alone. H-OFS duration for 
      at least 2 years was associated with significantly improved recurrence-free 
      survival.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy and the Development of New Depression Among Adults With Primary 
      Hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 1375-1382
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2024.3509 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder 
      associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although parathyroidectomy has been 
      associated with improvement of preexisting depression among adults with PHPT, the 
      effect of parathyroidectomy on the development of new depression is unknown. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of early parathyroidectomy on the incidence of 
      new depression among adults with PHPT compared with nonoperative management. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analyzed data included observational national 
      Veterans Affairs data from adults with a new diagnosis of PHPT from 2000 through 
      2019 using target trial emulation with cloning, a biostatistical method that uses 
      observational data to emulate a randomized clinical trial. New depression rates 
      were compared between those treated with early parathyroidectomy vs nonoperative 
      management using an extended Cox model with time-varying inverse probability 
      censoring weighting, adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, and 
      depression risk factors. Eligible adults with a new biochemical diagnosis of 
      PHPT, excluding those with past depression diagnoses, residing in an assisted 
      living/nursing facility, or with Charlson Comorbidity Index score higher than 4 
      were included. These data were analyzed January 4, 2023, through June 15, 2023. 
      EXPOSURE: Early parathyroidectomy (within 1 year of PHPT diagnosis) vs 
      nonoperative management. MAIN OUTCOME: New depression, including among subgroups 
      according to patient age (65 years or older; younger than 65 years) and baseline 
      serum calcium (11.3 mg/dL or higher; less than 11.3 mg/dL). RESULTS: The study 
      team identified 40 231 adults with PHPT and no history of depression of whom 
      35896 were male (89%) and the mean (SD) age was 67 (11.3) years. A total of 3294 
      patients underwent early parathyroidectomy (8.2%). The weighted cumulative 
      incidence of depression was 11% at 5 years and 18% at 10 years among patients who 
      underwent parathyroidectomy, compared with 9% and 18%, respectively, among 
      nonoperative patients. Those treated with early parathyroidectomy experienced no 
      difference in the adjusted rate of new depression compared with nonoperative 
      management (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.17). There was also no estimated 
      effect of early parathyroidectomy on new depression in subgroup analyses based on 
      patient age or serum calcium. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there was no difference 
      in the incidence of new depression among adults with PHPT treated with early 
      parathyroidectomy vs nonoperative management, which is relevant to preoperative 
      discussions about the benefits and risks of operative treatment.

TI  - Trastuzumab in early curative breast cancer: A target trial emulation benchmarked 
      against two randomized clinical trials.
PG  - e1004661
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004661 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Benchmarking an observational analysis against a randomized trial can 
      increase confidence in the use of observational data to complement inferences 
      made in trials. Until now, few examples of benchmarking have been within 
      oncology. However, benchmarking trials of a cancer treatment poses a unique set 
      of challenges, such as defining composite outcomes like disease-free survival. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed a target trial with a protocol as similar as 
      possible to the B-31 and N9831 randomized trials, which estimated the effect of 
      adjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in 
      individuals with early human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast 
      cancer. We then carried out an observational analysis by emulating the target 
      trial using routinely collected data from Swedish registries to understand if we 
      can estimate a similar effect of trastuzumab as the trial. The primary endpoint 
      was the composite of disease-free survival consisting of the earliest of (1) 
      local or regional recurrences, (2) distant recurrences, (3) contralateral breast 
      cancer, (4) other second primary cancer, or (5) death from any cause. Individuals 
      who had data compatible with both treatment strategies at baseline were cloned 
      and one copy was assigned to each arm. We applied inverse probability weights to 
      adjust for baseline and time-varying confounding (e.g., age and hematological 
      events like neutropenia).. Our observational analysis included 1,578 women, with 
      a median age of 59 years, and who were diagnosed between 2008 and 2015. We 
      estimated a similar effect after five years of follow-up (RR: 0.54, 95% CI [0.44, 
      0.67]) for the composite endpoint of disease-free survival as the two jointly 
      analyzed B-31 and N9831 trials (HR: 0.48, 95% CI [0.39, 0.59]). While the 
      comparability of results increases confidence in our estimates, there remains a 
      risk of residual and unmeasured confounding, as is the case with all 
      observational analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully benchmarked an observational 
      analysis against the B-31 and N9831 trials. By aligning protocols and using 
      appropriate methodological approaches, we show that observational data can be 
      used to estimate similar results as randomized trials of cancer treatments, like 
      trastuzumab. This opens the door to using observational data to complement 
      results from randomized trials of cancer treatments which can provide quick, 
      cheap, and robust evidence to support decision-making where trials leave evidence 
      gaps.

TI  - Modern Evidence Generation on Medication Effectiveness and Safety During 
      Pregnancy: Study Design Considerations.
PG  - 895-909
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3598 [doi]
AB  - Non-randomized studies will remain the mainstay for evidence on medications' 
      effects in pregnancy since the number of pregnant participants in randomized 
      clinical trials is insufficient to evaluate uncommon but serious pregnancy 
      outcomes. There has been a growing interest in conceptualizing causal inference 
      based on observational data as an attempt to emulate a hypothetical randomized 
      trial: the target trial. This approach can help identify design flaws and ensuing 
      biases and can point toward potential solutions. Adoption of the target trial 
      emulation framework in perinatal studies raises unique challenges due to the 
      distinct role of gestational time. Challenges include, among others, identifying 
      the timing of conception, pregnancy losses as competing events for later 
      outcomes, different etiologically relevant time windows depending on the outcome, 
      and time-varying outcome risks. We discuss various considerations in developing a 
      protocol for a target trial evaluating drug effects in pregnancy and its 
      observational emulation in databases and registries. While not a panacea, the 
      framework offers a valuable tool to guide us through the specification of the 
      causal questions, the study population and the treatment strategies to be 
      compared and helps to identify avoidable biases as well as unavoidable deviations 
      from the optimal protocol. Making these deviations explicit elucidates the 
      assumptions we make when drawing causal conclusions, and the types of analyses 
      that can be undertaken to quantify the potential magnitude of such biases. Such 
      discipline in the design, conduct, and reporting of pregnancy studies will 
      ultimately lead to the best information possible to inform treatment decisions 
      during pregnancy.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of systemic heparin during arteriovenous fistula 
      creation by emulating a target trial.
PG  - 651-658
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae098 [doi]
AB  - Most of the 800 000 people living with end-stage kidney disease in the United 
      States rely on a functioning vascular access to provide life-sustaining 
      hemodialysis, yet one-third of arteriovenous fistulas experience early failures. 
      Determining the safety and effectiveness of systemic heparin during fistula 
      creation could improve the quality and quantity of life for these vulnerable 
      patients. In this article, a pragmatic randomized trial was emulated to assess 
      the effect of systemic heparin administration (vs none) during radiocephalic 
      arteriovenous fistula creation on early bleeding and thrombosis, using data from 
      2 international, multicenter, randomized trials performed between 2014 and 2019. 
      Marginal risks were estimated using inverse probability weighted parametric 
      survival analysis and CIs were generated with bootstrapping. A total of 914 
      patients were enrolled and 61% received systemic heparin; their median (IQR) age 
      was 58 (49, 67) years and 45% were on hemodialysis at enrollment. No difference 
      in the risk of bleeding events was observed, with a risk difference (95% CI) at 
      14 days of -0.1% (-1.6 to 1.4). The risk of access thrombosis was lower in the 
      heparin group, with a risk of 3.7% (2.6-4.8) after heparin and 5.3% (3.4-7.4) 
      without heparin at 14 days (risk ratio = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98). Trial 
      registration: ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifiers: NCT02110901 and NCT02414841.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggested breast conserving 
      therapy (BCT) and mastectomy have similar survival for early-stage breast cancer, 
      whereas observational studies reported survival advantage for BCT. We aimed to 
      address biases in observational studies to compare the effect of BCT and 
      mastectomy on survival. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using institutional 
      cancer registry. We included adult women diagnosed with early invasive first 
      primary breast tumors ≤ 5 cm between July 2011 and December 2017. We used 
      cloning, censoring, and weighting to estimate risk differences (RDs) and risk 
      ratios (RRs) for all-cause mortality and recurrence or all-cause mortality 
      between BCT and mastectomy (reference). RESULTS: Our study population comprised 
      534 observations with breast cancer. Median age was 56 years and 65 % were 
      racial/ethnic minorities. The 8-year RD was 1.5 % (95 % confidence limits [CL]: 
      -7.0 %, 9.8 %) and RR was 1.1 (95 % CL: 0.57, 2.2) for all-cause mortality. 
      Results for recurrence or mortality were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that target trial emulation to mitigate selection and immortal-time 
      biases in observational studies may generate estimates that are more compatible 
      with RCTs when comparing the effects of BCT and mastectomy on survival. Studies 
      with longer follow-up and more events are needed to confirm our findings.

TI  - Effect of bariatric surgery on cancer risk: results from an emulated target trial 
      using population-based data.
PG  - 433-438
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znac003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of weight loss induced by bariatric surgery on cancer 
      occurrence is controversial. To study the causal effect of bariatric surgery on 
      cancer risk from an observational database, a target-trial emulation technique 
      was used to mimic an RCT. METHODS: Data on patients admitted between 2010 and 
      2019 with a diagnosis of obesity were extracted from a national hospital 
      discharge database. Criteria for inclusion included eligibility criteria for 
      bariatric surgery and the absence of cancer in the 2 years following inclusion. 
      The intervention arms were bariatric surgery versus no surgery. Outcomes were the 
      occurrence of any cancer and obesity-related cancer; cancers not related to 
      obesity were used as negative controls. RESULTS: A total of 1 140 347 patients 
      eligible for bariatric surgery were included in the study. Some 288 604 patients 
      (25.3 per cent) underwent bariatric surgery. A total of 48 411 cancers were 
      identified, including 4483 in surgical patients and 43 928 among patients who did 
      not receive bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery was associated with a decrease 
      in the risk of obesity-related cancer (hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95 per cent c.i. 
      0.83 to 0.95), whereas no significant effect of surgery was identified with 
      regard to cancers not related to obesity (HR 0.96, 0.91 to 1.01). CONCLUSION: 
      When emulating a target trial from observational data, a reduction of 11 per cent 
      in obesity-related cancer was found after bariatric surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in 2022, brings 
      substantial reforms to the US healthcare system, particularly regarding Medicare. 
      A key aspect includes the introduction of Medicare price negotiation. The 
      objective of this commentary is to explore the implications of the IRA for US 
      pharmaceutical companies, with a specific focus on the role of real-world 
      evidence (RWE) in the context of Medicare reforms. METHODS: This commentary uses 
      a qualitative analysis of the IRA's provisions related to healthcare and 
      pharmaceutical regulation, focusing on how these reforms change the evidence 
      requirements for pharmaceutical companies. It discusses the methodological 
      aspects of generating and using RWE, including techniques such as target trial 
      emulation and quantitative bias analysis methods to address biases inherent in 
      RWE. RESULTS: This commentary highlights that the IRA introduces a unique 
      approach to value assessment in the United States by evaluating drug value 
      several years after launch, as opposed to at launch, similar to health technology 
      assessments in other regions. It underscores the central role of RWE in comparing 
      drug effectiveness across diverse clinical scenarios to improve the accuracy of 
      real-world data comparisons. Furthermore, this article identifies key 
      methodologies for managing the inherent biases in RWE, which are crucial for 
      generating credible evidence for IRA price negotiations. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      article underscores the importance of these methodologies in ensuring credible 
      evidence for IRA price negotiations. It advocates for an integrated approach in 
      evidence generation, positioning RWE as pivotal for informed pricing discussions 
      in the US healthcare landscape.

TI  - Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy versus conventional fractionated radiotherapy 
      for clinical early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer: a population-based study.
PG  - 1779-1791
LID - 10.1111/1759-7714.15404 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) over 
      conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) for early-stage non-small-cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) has been advocated, but is also debated in the literature. 
      METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we adopted a target trial emulation 
      framework to identify eligible patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2021 using the 
      Taiwan Cancer Registry. In the primary analysis, the overall survival (OS) was 
      the primary endpoint, whereas incidences of lung cancer mortality and radiation 
      pulmonary toxicity were the secondary endpoints. Extensive supplementary analyses 
      were also conducted. RESULTS: We included 351 patients in the primary analysis 
      and found that the OS was not significantly different between the SABR (n = 290) 
      and CFRT (n = 61) groups. The propensity score weighting adjusted hazard ratio of 
      death was 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.53-1.07, p = 0.118). The secondary 
      endpoints and supplementary analyses showed no significant differences. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The OS of patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with SABR was not 
      significantly different from that of patients treated with CFRT alone. The 
      results of the relevant ongoing clinical trials are eagerly awaited.

TI  - Benchmarking Observational Analyses Before Using Them to Address Questions Trials 
      Do Not Answer: An Application to Coronary Thrombus Aspiration.
PG  - 1652-1665

AB  - To increase confidence in the use of observational analyses when addressing 
      effectiveness questions beyond those addressed by randomized trials, one can 
      first benchmark the observational analyses against existing trial results. We 
      used Swedish registry data to emulate a target trial similar to the Thrombus 
      Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia (TASTE) 
      randomized trial, which found no difference in the risk of death or myocardial 
      infarction by 1 year with or without thrombus aspiration among individuals with 
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction. We benchmarked the emulation against the 
      trial at 1 year and then extended the emulation's follow-up to 3 years and 
      estimated effects in subpopulations underrepresented in the trial. As in the 
      TASTE trial, the observational analysis found no differences in risk of outcomes 
      by 1 year between groups (risk difference = 0.7 (confidence interval, -0.7, 2.0) 
      and -0.2 (confidence interval, -1.3, 1.0) for death and myocardial infarction, 
      respectively), so benchmarking was considered successful. We additionally showed 
      no difference in risk of death or myocardial infarction by 3 years, or within 
      subpopulations by 1 year. Benchmarking against an index trial before using 
      observational analyses to answer questions beyond those the trial could address 
      allowed us to explore whether the observational data can be trusted to deliver 
      valid estimates of treatment effects.

      effectiveness research: Lessons from the GARFIELD-AF and ORBIT-AF registries.

AB  - Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for 
      estimating the effectiveness of a treatment. However, in many instances they are 
      impractical to conduct because of time limitations, cost restrictions, or ethical 
      reasons. As a consequence, non-randomized observational studies have an important 
      role in comparative effectiveness and safety research since they can address 
      issues that would not be possible using conventional RCT methodology. 
      Observational studies can be strategically designed to reduce the risk of 
      potential sources of bias by emulating the design principles of an equivalent but 
      ideal randomized trial - the target trial - that would answer the research 
      question of interest. In this article, we review some of the necessary components 
      of observational studies required for valid causal inference within the framework 
      of target trial emulation, so as to avoid common methodological pitfalls of study 
      design. We discuss the assumptions of consistency, time-zero specification, 
      exchangeability and positivity. To illustrate these concepts in a context where 
      existing knowledge is well-established through clinical trials, we evaluate and 
      compare the treatment effects of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) against no VKA (No 
      VKA) on the treatment of atrial fibrillation from two real-world observational 
      studies, namely the GARFIELD-AF and ORBIT-AF registries. Results are compared 
      with those of published RCTs.

TI  - Replacement Strategies for Tunneled Hemodialysis Catheters with Complications: A 
      Nationwide Cohort Study.
PG  - 1148-1158
LID - 10.2215/CJN.0000000000000495 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Replacement strategies for hemodialysis catheters with mechanical 
      failure differed widely between services, which suggests clinical equipoise. For 
      mechanical hemodialysis catheter failure, exchange did not result in more 
      dysfunction or infection than removal and separate replacement. In Australia, 
      infected catheters were almost universally removed and then replaced through a 
      separate tunnel tract. BACKGROUND: Tunneled hemodialysis catheters often have 
      infectious or mechanical complications that require unplanned removal and 
      replacement, but the optimal replacement strategy is unknown. This study 
      described the real-world use of two strategies in Australia and compared the 
      survival of replacement catheters inserted by either strategy. METHODS: 
      Observational data from the REDUcing the burden of dialysis Catheter 
      ComplicaTIOns: a National approach trial, which enrolled a nationwide cohort of 
      6400 adults who received an incident hemodialysis catheter (2016–2020), was used 
      for this secondary analysis. Tunneled catheters were replaced by either catheter 
      exchange through the existing tunnel tract or removal and replacement through a 
      new tract. The effect of the replacement strategy on the time to catheter removal 
      because of infection or dysfunction was estimated by emulating a hypothetical 
      pragmatic randomized trial among a subset of 434 patients with mechanical 
      tunneled catheter failure. RESULTS: Of 9974 tunneled hemodialysis catheters 
      inserted during the trial, 380 had infectious and 945 had mechanical 
      complications that required replacement. Almost all infected hemodialysis 
      catheters (97%) were removed and separately replaced through a new tunnel tract, 
      whereas nephrology services differed widely in their replacement practices for 
      catheters with mechanical failure (median=50% guidewire exchanged, interquartile 
      range=30%–67%). Service-level differences accounted for 29% of the residual 
      variation after adjusting for patient factors. In the target trial emulation 
      cohort of patients with mechanical catheter failure (n=434 patients), catheter 
      exchange was not associated with lower complication-free survival at 1, 6, or 12 
      months (counterfactual survival difference at 1 month=5.9%; 95% confidence 
      interval, −2% to 14%). CONCLUSIONS: Guidewire exchange for mechanical failure of 
      catheter was not associated with lower catheter survival and may be preferable 
      for patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION AND PROTOCOL: The trial was registered in the 
      Australia and New Zealand clinical trials registry on the June 23, 2016 
      (ACTRN12616000830493).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Some therapeutic strategy questions in oncology could be answered 
      with studies using observational data. Target trial emulation is the application 
      of design principles from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to the analysis of 
      observational data, to reduce design-induced biases. Our objective was to 
      determine which type of study physicians would preferably plan to answer a 
      comparative effectiveness question lacking evidence in oncology. METHODS: We 
      launched an online survey among physicians specialized in oncology. We 
      constructed a vignette-based inquiry where vignettes described study scenarios 
      which could be conducted to answer the predefined question. We designed six 
      vignettes described by study design (RCT or observational study with a trial 
      emulation framework), main study characteristics, probability of the study 
      succeeding and anticipated delay before results availability. Participants 
      randomly assessed five pair-wise comparisons of the vignettes and were asked 
      which study they would preferably plan by using a Likert scale ranging from -5 to 
      5. The main outcome was the evaluation of clinicians' preferences for each 
      pairwise comparison. Mean and median preference scores were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Two hundred thirteen participants, specialized in many tumor types, assessed at 
      least one comparison with 82% reporting France as their country of affiliation. 
      The interquartile range was -4 to 4 across pairwise comparisons. The median 
      preference score was in disfavor of the monocentric RCT for the five comparisons 
      where it appeared. The median preference score was strongly in favor of the 
      multicentric national emulated trial when compared to the monocentric emulated 
      trial 4 [IQR 2.5-4]. The mean preference score was the highest for the large 
      European observational study 1.14 (SD 3.33), while the mean preference score was 
      the lowest for the monocentric RCT -1.86 (SD 2.93). CONCLUSION: No study design 
      was strongly preferred, but the monocentric RCT was the least favored study in 
      pair-wise comparisons. The planification of the new research is a compromise 
      between scientific soundness, feasibility, cost, and time before obtaining 
      results. We need to have the right answers to the right questions at the right 
      time.

TI  - Comparative Cardiovascular Safety of NSAID versus Colchicine Use When Initiating 
      Urate-Lowering Therapy Among Patients with Gout: Target Trial Emulations.
LID - 10.1002/art.43259 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Among patients with gout, NSAIDs are commonly used despite scarce 
      safety data in this specific population. Therefore, we quantified the comparative 
      cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs versus colchicine among patients with gout 
      starting allopurinol. METHODS: We conducted a sequential, propensity 
      score-matched, new-user comparative effectiveness study using the target trial 
      emulation framework to compare the risk of MACE (composite of myocardial 
      infarction [MI], stroke, or cardiovascular death) among patients with gout 
      started on allopurinol who were prescribed NSAIDs or colchicine for gout flare 
      prophylaxis. A sensivity analysis employed inverse probability of treatment 
      weighting (IPTW). Secondarily, we examined the risk of MACE with colchicine or 
      NSAIDs versus no prophylaxis. RESULTS: Among 18,120 propensity score-matched 
      adults with gout starting allopurinol with NSAIDs or colchicine (83.5% male, mean 
      age 60.9 years), the incidence of MACE and cardiovascular death were higher among 
      NSAID users compared to colchicine users, with rate differences of 38.8 (95% CI, 
      15.4 to 62.2) and 10.9 (0.7 to 21.1) per 1000 person-years, respectively, and 
      hazard ratios (HR) of 1.56 (1.11 to 2.17) and 2.50 (1.14 to 5.26), respectively. 
      Results were similar when IPTW was applied. Compared to no prophylaxis, NSAID use 
      was associated with a higher risk of MACE and MI with HRs 1.50 (1.17 to 1.91) and 
      1.93 (1.35 to 2.75), respectively. CONCLUSION: In these target trial emulations 
      of patients with gout starting allopurinol, NSAID prophylaxis was associated with 
      a higher risk of MACE than colchicine or no prophylaxis, suggesting the avoidance 
      of NSAID for gout flare prophylaxis.

TI  - Antibiotic Treatment in Patients Hospitalized for Nonsevere COVID-19.
PG  - e2511499
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.11499 [doi]
LID - e2511499
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Patients hospitalized with nonsevere COVID-19 continue to receive 
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) antibiotic treatment despite a low risk of 
      bacterial coinfection. Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing contributes to global 
      antibiotic resistance and also poses a threat to individual patients. OBJECTIVE: 
      To examine the association of CAP antibiotic treatment started on admission with 
      clinical outcomes among a large sample of patients hospitalized for nonsevere 
      COVID-19 in hospitals across the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      retrospective cohort study used a target trial emulation design. Participants 
      were adult, immunocompetent patients admitted to general care for COVID-19 from 
      April 2020 to December 2023 at 1053 US-based acute-care hospitals that contribute 
      data to the Premier Healthcare Database. Patients with nonpneumonia bacterial 
      infections present on admission were excluded. Data were analyzed from April to 
      October 2024. EXPOSURE: Receipt of a CAP antibiotic regimen on the day of 
      admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite 
      measure of deterioration (vasopressor, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, 
      invasive mechanical ventilation, intermediate care, intensive care unit 
      admission) and in-hospital mortality occurring on day 2 or later. The association 
      between receipt of antibiotic therapy and the primary outcome was assessed using 
      propensity methods while adjusting for a broad set of potential confounders, 
      including cotreatments. RESULTS: The cohort included 520 405 patients with 
      COVID-19 (median [IQR] age, 66 [53-78] years; 266 186 [51.2%] male), including 
      92 708 Black patients (17.8%), 63 619 Hispanic patients (12.2%), and 304 649 
      White patients (58.5%); 279 656 patients (53.7%) had Medicare insurance. A total 
      of 160 482 patients (30.8%) were treated with a CAP antibiotic regimen on day 1 
      of admission. The primary composite outcome was higher in the CAP group (20.8%) 
      compared with the unexposed (no antibiotic) group (18.4%), but the difference did 
      not meet the predefined criteria for clinical significance (ASD, 4.1%). Patients 
      who received CAP antibiotics had higher odds of poor clinical outcomes 
      (propensity matched-odds ratio [OR], 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]; P = .003; inverse 
      probability treatment weighted-OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.05]; P < .001; 
      standardized mortality ratio weighted-OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.08-1.12]; P < .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large cohort study of patients hospitalized 
      with nonsevere COVID-19, there was no clinically meaningful difference in 
      outcomes with early antibiotic treatment. Given the risks associated with 
      unnecessary antibiotic treatment, these results argue against routine antibiotic 
      use in this population.

TI  - Comparing Effect Estimates in Randomized Trials and Observational Studies From 
      the Same Population: An Application to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
PG  - e020357
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.120.020357 [doi]
LID - e020357
AB  - Background To understand when results from observational studies and randomized 
      trials are comparable, we performed an observational emulation of a target trial 
      designed to ask similar questions as the VALIDATE (Bivalirudin Versus Heparin in 
      ST-Segment and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Patients on 
      Modern Antiplatelet Therapy) randomized trial. The VALIDATE trial compared the 
      effect of bivalirudin and heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention on 
      the risk of death, myocardial infarction, and bleeding across Sweden. Methods and 
      Results We specified the protocol of a target trial similar to the VALIDATE 
      trial, then emulated the target trial in the period before the VALIDATE trial 
      took place using data from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web System for Enhancement and 
      Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to 
      Recommended Therapies) registry-the same registry in which the trial was 
      undertaken. The target trial emulation and the VALIDATE trial both estimated 
      little or no effect of bivalirudin versus heparin on the risk of death or 
      myocardial infarction by 180 days (target trial emulation risk ratio for death, 
      1.21 [95% CI, 0.88 - 1.54]; VALIDATE trial hazard ratio for death, 1.05 [95% CI, 
      0.78 - 1.41]). The observational data, however, could not capture less severe 
      cases of bleeding, resulting in an inability to define a bleeding outcome like 
      the trial, and could not accurately estimate the comparative risk of death by 14 
      days, which may be the result of intractable confounding early in follow-up or 
      the inability to precisely emulate the trial's eligibility criteria. Conclusions 
      Using real-world data to emulate a target trial can deliver accurate effect 
      estimates. Yet, even with rich observational data, it is not always possible to 
      estimate the short-term effect of interventions or the effect on outcomes for 
      which data are not routinely collected.

      randomised trial.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2025.2487560 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard design 
      to obtain knowledge of causal effects of treatments. However, not all causal 
      questions can be answered by randomised trials for practical or ethical reasons. 
      Target trial emulation is a conceptual framework and set of analysis methods to 
      obtain knowledge of causal effects of treatments using observational data, and is 
      particularly valuable when randomised trials are not feasible. OBJECTIVES: In 
      this Perspective, we outline the concepts and application of target trial 
      emulation, showing how it can be used to minimise bias due to confounding at 
      baseline and over the course of sustained treatments, and how causal per-protocol 
      analysis can be performed to provide informative yet unbiased estimates of 
      treatment effects. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: We summarise a recent target trial 
      emulation that examined the effects of intensity of early rehabilitation for hip 
      fracture on performance in activities of daily living as a worked example. We 
      encourage investigators to explore the target trial framework, and apply it to 
      answer causal questions when using observational data.

OAB - Target trial emulation is a framework and set of analysis methods to guide the 
      analysis of observational data to estimate causal effects.Target trial emulation 
      makes assumptions transparent, ensures causal questions are realistic and can be 
      answered, and helps minimise bias due to confounding.We summarise a recent study 
      that emulated target trials to examine the effect of intensity of early 
      rehabilitation for hip fracture on performance in activities of daily living.This 
      makes treatment effects available from trials that may be difficult to run for 
      practical reasons.

TI  - Emulating a Novel Clinical Trial Using Existing Observational Data. Predicting 
      Results of the PreVent Study.
PG  - 998-1007
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201903-241OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: "Target trial emulation" has been proposed as an observational method 
      to answer comparative effectiveness questions, but it has rarely been attempted 
      concurrently with a randomized clinical trial (RCT).Objectives: We tested the 
      hypothesis that blinded analysts applying target trial emulation to existing 
      observational data could predict the results of an RCT.Methods: PreVent 
      (Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation) was 
      a multicenter RCT examining the effects of positive-pressure ventilation during 
      tracheal intubation on oxygen saturation and severe hypoxemia. Analysts unaware 
      of PreVent's results used patient-level data from three previous trials 
      evaluating airway management interventions to emulate PreVent's eligibility 
      criteria, randomization procedure, and statistical analysis. After PreVent's 
      release, results of this blinded observational analysis were compared with those 
      of the RCT. Difference-in-differences estimates for comparison of treatment 
      effects between the observational analysis and the PreVent trial are reported on 
      the absolute scale.Results: Using observational data, we were able to emulate 
      PreVent's randomization procedure to produce balanced groups for comparison. The 
      lowest oxygen saturation during intubation was higher in the positive-pressure 
      ventilation group than the no positive-pressure ventilation group in the 
      observational analysis (n = 360; mean difference = 1.8%; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] = -1.0 to 4.6) and in the PreVent trial (n = 401; mean difference = 3.9%; 
      95% CI = 1.4 to 6.4), though the observational analysis could not exclude no 
      difference. Difference-in-differences estimates comparing treatment effects 
      showed reasonable agreement for lowest oxygen saturation between the 
      observational analysis and the PreVent trial (mean difference = -2.1%; 95% 
      CI = -5.9 to 1.7). Positive-pressure ventilation resulted in lower rates of 
      severe hypoxemia in both the observational analysis (risk ratio = 0.60; 95% 
      CI = 0.38 to 0.93) and in the PreVent trial (risk ratio = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.30 to 
      0.77). The absolute reduction in the incidence of severe hypoxemia with 
      positive-pressure ventilation was similar in the observational analysis (9.4%) 
      and the PreVent trial (12.0%), though the difference between these estimates had 
      wide CIs (mean difference = 2.5%; 95% CI = -8.0 to 13.6%).Conclusions: Applying 
      target trial emulation methods to existing observational data for the evaluation 
      of a novel intervention produced results similar to those of a randomized trial. 
      These findings support the use of target trial emulation for comparative 
      effectiveness research.

TI  - Partial Hepatectomy and Ablation for Survival of Early-Stage Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma Patients: A Bayesian Emulation Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/life14060661 [doi]
LID - 661
AB  - Partial hepatectomy and ablation therapy are two widely used surgical procedures 
      for localized early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This article 
      aimed to evaluate their relative effectiveness in terms of overall survival. An 
      emulation analysis approach was first developed based on the Bayesian technique. 
      We estimated propensity scores via Bayesian logistic regression and adopted a 
      weighted Bayesian Weibull accelerated failure time (AFT) model incorporating 
      prior information contained in the published literature. With the Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, an emulated target trial with 
      rigorously defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and treatment regimens for 
      early-stage HCC patients over 66 years old was developed. For the main cohort 
      with tumor size less than or equal to 5 cm, a total of 1146 patients were 
      enrolled in the emulated trial, with 301 and 845 in the partial hepatectomy and 
      ablation arms, respectively. The analysis suggested ablation to be significantly 
      associated with inferior overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35; 95% credible 
      interval [CrI]: 1.14, 1.60). For the subgroup with tumor size less than or equal 
      to 3 cm, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two 
      arms (HR = 1.15; 95% CrI: 0.88, 1.52). Overall, the comparative treatment effect 
      of ablation and partial hepatectomy on survival remains inconclusive. This 
      finding may provide further insight into HCC clinical treatment.

TI  - Effectiveness of Iptacopan Versus C5 Inhibitors in Complement Inhibitor-Naive 
      Patients With Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria.
PG  - e270055
LID - 10.1002/jha2.70055 [doi]
LID - e270055
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterised by 
      haemolytic anaemia, bone marrow failure and thrombosis. The single-arm phase 3 
      APPOINT-PNH trial (NCT04820530) investigating iptacopan monotherapy in complement 
      inhibitor-naive patients demonstrated significant haemoglobin concentration 
      improvements. METHODS: We used target trial emulation to retrospectively predict 
      outcomes if APPOINT-PNH trial patients had received C5 inhibitors instead of 
      iptacopan. Estimates were derived from the real-world APPEX cohort treated with 
      routine C5 inhibitors. The study used benchmarking and comparative effectiveness 
      to evaluate the haematological response in APPOINT-PNH if patients had received 
      C5 inhibitors. Treatment effect was estimated using propensity scores to model 
      the probability of trial inclusion based on baseline covariates, followed by 
      fitting an outcome model to the APPEX cohort. RESULTS: The analysis of 125 
      patients showed all estimated treatment effects (95% confidence interval) 
      favoured iptacopan over C5 inhibitors: differences in the proportion of patients 
      achieving haemoglobin increase from baseline of ≥ 2 g/dL, 68.2% (40.9-95.6); 
      haemoglobin levels of ≥ 12 g/dL, 53.4% (31.4-75.3); transfusion independence, 
      38.8% (15.1-62.5); ratio of percent change from baseline in lactate dehydrogenase 
      levels, 0.51 (0.40-0.67); change from baseline in reticulocytes, -75.5 × 10(9)/L 
      (-106.9, -44.2). CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate C5 inhibitor-naive patients with 
      PNH may experience greater haematological response with iptacopan than with C5 
      inhibitors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05842486.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone are effective medications for 
      people with opioid use disorder; however, interruptions in daily dosing are 
      common and diminish the benefits of these medications. While clinical guidelines 
      in most North American jurisdictions, including British Columbia (BC), recommend 
      dose adjustment after treatment interruptions to varying levels of specificity, 
      the evidence to support these recommendations is limited. We aim to estimate the 
      comparative effectiveness of alternative dose adjustment strategies on subsequent 
      overdose-related acute care visits and discontinuation of opioid agonist 
      treatment in BC, Canada. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a linkage of nine health 
      administrative databases, we propose a population-level retrospective cohort 
      study of adults aged 18 years or older in BC who initiated methadone or 
      buprenorphine/naloxone between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2022. We will 
      specify parallel hypothetical trials, known as target trials, for methadone 
      interruptions of 1-3 days, 4 days and 5-14 days, and buprenorphine/naloxone 
      interruptions of 1-5 days and 6-14 days. Following the index interruption, the 
      primary outcomes are the time to overdose-related acute care visits and treatment 
      discontinuation (interruptions lasting >14 days), with time to all-cause acute 
      care visits as a secondary outcome. The intention-to-treat effect will be 
      estimated using both propensity score and instrumental variable approaches. A 
      range of sensitivity analyses will assess the robustness of our results, 
      including cohort and timeline restriction, alternative definitions of exposure 
      and outcome and alternative estimation strategies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The 
      protocol, cohort creation and analysis plan have been classified and approved as 
      a quality improvement initiative by Providence Health Care Research Institute and 
      the Simon Fraser University Office of Research Ethics. All data are deidentified, 
      securely stored and accessed in accordance with provincial privacy regulations. 
      Results will be disseminated to local advocacy groups and decision-makers, 
      national and international clinical guideline developers, presented at 
      international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals electronically 
      and in print.

TI  - Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists and Incidence of Dementia Among Older 
      Adults With Type 2 Diabetes : A Target Trial Emulation.
LID - 10.7326/ANNALS-24-02648 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been shown 
      to decrease blood glucose levels, promote weight loss, and prevent cardiovascular 
      events. However, evidence is limited regarding their effect on dementia, although 
      emerging observational studies, some with serious methodological limitations, 
      have suggested large reductions in dementia associated with GLP-1RAs that may not 
      be entirely causally related. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of GLP-1RAs versus 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) as second-line therapy for type 2 
      diabetes on risk for dementia among older adults. DESIGN: Target trial emulation. 
      SETTING: United States from January 2016 to December 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare 
      fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 66 years or older with diabetes who used 
      metformin and did not have dementia at baseline and initiated GLP-1RAs or DPP4is 
      between January 2017 and December 2018. MEASUREMENTS: Onset of dementia was 
      defined as 1 year before the date of a new dementia diagnosis. Risks were 
      calculated at 30 months in GLP-1RA and DPP4i groups matched in a 1:2 ratio on an 
      estimated propensity score and compared via ratios and differences. RESULTS: 
      Among 2418 patients initiating GLP-1RAs and 4836 matched patients initiating 
      DPP4is, the mean age was 71 years, and 55% were female. Over a median follow-up 
      of 1.9 years, the outcome occurred in 96 patients in the GLP-1RA group and 217 in 
      the DPP4i group. The estimated risk difference at 30 months was -0.93 (95% CI, 
      -2.33 to 0.23) percentage points, and the estimated risk ratio was 0.83 (95% CI, 
      0.61 to 1.05). The estimated risk ratios were 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.93) and 
      1.22 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.66) among those younger than 75 years and aged 75 years 
      or older, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Potential residual confounding (no data on 
      body mass index, glycemic control, or duration of diabetes), outcome 
      misclassification, and short follow-up. CONCLUSION: Among older adults with 
      diabetes, no clear evidence was found that the incidence of dementia differed 
      overall between patients using GLP-1RAs versus DPP4is. Under conventional 
      statistical criteria, an effect of GLP-1RAs between a 39% decrease and a 5% 
      increase in risk for dementia was highly compatible with the data, although 
      estimates differed by age. Randomized trials are needed to quantify the effect of 
      GLP-1RAs on dementia. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Gregory Annenberg Weingarten, GRoW

TI  - Waiting Time for Second Kidney Transplantation and Mortality.
PG  - 90-97
LID - 10.2215/CJN.07620621 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The median kidney transplant half-life is 10-15 years. 
      Because of the scarcity of donor organs and immunologic sensitization of 
      candidates for retransplantation, there is a need for quantitative information on 
      if and when a second transplantation is no longer associated with a lower risk of 
      mortality compared with waitlisted patients treated by dialysis. Therefore, we 
      investigated the association of time on waiting list with patient survival in 
      patients who received a second transplantation versus remaining on the waiting 
      list. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In this retrospective study 
      using target trial emulation, we analyzed data of 2346 patients from the Austrian 
      Dialysis and Transplant Registry and Eurotransplant with a failed first graft, 
      aged over 18 years, and waitlisted for a second kidney transplantation in Austria 
      during the years 1980-2019. The differences in restricted mean survival time and 
      hazard ratios for all-cause mortality comparing the treatment strategies 
      "retransplant" versus "remain waitlisted with maintenance dialysis" are reported 
      for different waiting times after first graft loss. RESULTS: Second kidney 
      transplantation showed a longer restricted mean survival time at 10 years of 
      follow-up compared with remaining on the waiting list (5.8 life months gained; 
      95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 11.1). This survival difference was diminished in 
      patients with longer waiting time after loss of the first allograft; restricted 
      mean survival time differences at 10 years were 8.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.9 
      to 14.0) and 0.1 life months gained (95% confidence interval, -14.3 to 15.2) for 
      patients with waiting time for retransplantation of <1 and 8 years, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Second kidney transplant is associated with patient survival 
      compared with remaining waitlisted and treatment by dialysis, but the survival 
      difference diminishes with longer waiting time.

AB  - Introduction: In causal inference, the correct formulation of the scientific 
      question of interest is a crucial step. The purpose of this study was to apply 
      causal inference principles to external control analysis using observational data 
      and illustrate the process to define the estimand attributes. Methods: This study 
      compared long-term survival outcomes of a pooled set of three previously reported 
      randomized phase 3 trials studying patients with metastatic non-small cell lung 
      cancer receiving front-line chemotherapy and similar patients treated with 
      front-line chemotherapy as part of routine clinical care. Causal inference 
      frameworks were applied to define the estimand aligned with the research question 
      and select the estimator to estimate the estimand of interest. Results: The 
      estimand attributes of the ideal trial were defined using the estimand framework. 
      The target trial framework was used to address specific issues in defining the 
      estimand attributes using observational data from a nationwide electronic health 
      record-derived de-identified database. The two frameworks combined allow to 
      clearly define the estimand and the aligned estimator while accounting for key 
      baseline confounders, index date, and receipt of subsequent therapies. The hazard 
      ratio estimate (point estimate with 95% confidence interval) comparing the 
      randomized clinical trial pooled control arm with the external control was close 
      to 1, which is indicative of similar survival between the two arms. Discussion: 
      The proposed combined framework provides clarity on the causal contrast of 
      interest and the estimator to adopt, and thus facilitates design and 
      interpretation of the analyses.

TI  - Compliance with the DASH diet and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
      in patients with myocardial infarction.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has 
      been shown to effectively reduce blood pressure and body weight, but its 
      effectiveness for reducing (cardiovascular) mortality rates has never been 
      assessed in a clinical trial. Causal effects of dietary interventions are 
      difficult to measure, due to practical limitations of randomized controlled diet 
      trials. Target trial emulation can be used to improve causal inference in 
      observational data. The aim of this study was to emulate a target trial assessing 
      the relationship between compliance with the DASH diet and cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality risk in patients with established CVD. METHODS: Using data 
      from the Alpha Omega Cohort, we emulated a DASH diet trial in patients with a 
      history of myocardial infarction (MI). Inverse probability of treatment weighting 
      (IPTW) was used to balance confounders over DASH-compliant and non-DASH-compliant 
      participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with IPT-weighted Cox models. 
      RESULTS: Of 4365 patients (79% male, median age 69 years, >80% treated with 
      lipid- and blood pressure-lowering medication), 598 were classified as 
      DASH-compliant (compliance score ≥5 out of 9). During a median follow-up of 12.4 
      years, 2035 deaths occurred of which 903 (44%) were of cardiovascular origin. 
      DASH compliance was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95%CI 
      0.0.80-1.06) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.90, 95%CI 0.72-1.11). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In an emulated target trial on the DASH diet in the Alpha Omega 
      cohort no relation was found between DASH compliance and risk of all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with a history of MI. The DASH diet's 
      effects may have been modified in this population by concomitant use of blood 
      pressure-lowering medications.

TI  - Infection risk in sarcoidosis patients treated with methotrexate compared to 
      azathioprine: A retrospective 'target trial' emulated with Swedish real-world 
      data.
PG  - 452-460
LID - 10.1111/resp.14001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: No clinical trial has examined the risk of infection 
      associated methotrexate and azathioprine, two advocated treatments for 
      sarcoidosis. We aimed to compare the 6-month risk of infection after the 
      initiation of methotrexate or azathioprine. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 
      target trial emulation using Swedish pre-existing data. We searched for eligible 
      participants who were dispensed methotrexate or azathioprine in the Prescribed 
      Drug Register (PDR) every day between January 2007 and June 2013. Adults were 
      eligible if they had ≥2 ICD-coded visits for sarcoidosis in the National Patient 
      Register (NPR) and were dispensed ≥1 systemic corticosteroid but no methotrexate 
      or azathioprine in the past 6 months (PDR). Within 6 months of methotrexate or 
      azathioprine initiation, diagnosis of infectious disease was identified (visit in 
      the NPR where infectious disease was the primary diagnosis). We estimated RR and 
      risk differences comparing methotrexate (n = 667) to azathioprine initiations (n 
      = 259) using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) adjusting for 
      demographic factors, comorbidity and sarcoidosis severity proxies. RESULTS: There 
      were 43 infections in the methotrexate group (adjusted 6-month risk 6.8%) and 29 
      infections in the azathioprine group (12.0%). The RR for infectious disease at 
      6 months associated with methotrexate compared to azathioprine initiation was 
      0.57 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.82) and the risk difference was -5.2% (95% CI: -8.5%, 
      -1.8%). The RR at 9 months was attenuated to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.14). 
      CONCLUSION: Methotrexate appears to be associated with a lower risk of infection 
      in sarcoidosis than azathioprine, but randomized trials should confirm this 
      finding.

TI  - Efficacy of Lamivudine Plus Dolutegravir vs Dolutegravir-Based 3-Drug Regimens in 
      People With HIV Who Are Virologically Suppressed.
PG  - ofae198
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofae198 [doi]
LID - ofae198
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lamivudine + dolutegravir maintenance dual therapy (DT) could be less 
      effective than 3-drug therapy (TT) in the context of resistance-associated 
      mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The ARCA 
      database was queried to test this hypothesis with a trial emulation strategy. 
      METHODS: People with HIV taking 2 NRTIs plus a protease inhibitor or a non-NRTI 
      who switched to DT or dolutegravir-based TT were followed up from the first HIV 
      RNA <50 copies/mL (baseline) to virologic failure (VF; ie, 2 consecutive HIV RNA 
      ≥50 copies/mL or 1 HIV RNA ≥200 copies/mL). Those switching to DT within 6 months 
      were assigned to the treatment arm and all other patients to the control arm. 
      Each participant was also cloned, assigned to the opposite strategy, and censored 
      at the time of deviation from that strategy. Using inverse probability of 
      censoring weight Cox regression models, we calculated hazard ratios of VF for DT 
      vs TT stratified for the presence of resistance-associated mutations. RESULTS: 
      Overall 626 people were analyzed: 204 with DT and 422 with TT (73% men; mean age, 
      44 years). Ten and 31 VFs occurred with DT and TT, respectively, over a median 
      5.8 years. When compared with a fully active TT, the DT had similar efficacy 
      (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, .29-2.61; P = .812) when full 
      susceptibility was confirmed at historical genotype. When previous M184V/I was 
      present in both groups, the risk of VF was higher for DT vs TT but was not 
      statistically significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, .45-20.84; P = 
      .252). CONCLUSIONS: DT was not associated with a significantly higher risk of VF 
      than dolutegravir-based TT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy is administered first-line for many 
      gastrointestinal cancers. However, patients with cardiovascular disease commonly 
      receive alternative treatment due to cardiotoxicity concerns. OBJECTIVES: This 
      study sought to assess the risks of all-cause mortality and acute cardiovascular 
      events with fluoropyrimidine treatment. METHODS: We conducted an observational 
      cohort study applying a target trial emulation framework to linked national 
      cancer, cardiac, and hospitalization registry data from the Virtual 
      Cardio-Oncology Research Initiative. Adults diagnosed with tumors eligible for 
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy were included. 
      All-cause mortality and a composite of hospitalization for acute cardiovascular 
      events (acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac 
      intervention, cardiac arrest, and cardiac death) were compared in patients 
      treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy vs alternative management. 
      Adjusted, weighted pooled logistic regression models were used to estimate the 
      1-year risk difference (RD). RESULTS: Among 103,110 patients (mean age 69.7 
      years, 59% male), the absolute risk of death at 1 year was significantly lower in 
      fluoropyrimidine-treated patients (RD: -7.7%; 95% CI: -8.7% to -6.7%) with a 
      small increased risk of acute cardiovascular events (RD: 0.9%; 95% CI: 0.0% to 
      1.9%). This was primarily due to arrhythmias (RD: 0.8%; 95% CI: 0.1% to 1.6%) and 
      cardiac arrest (RD: 0.3%; 95% CI: 0.1% to 0.5%), with no increased risk of acute 
      coronary syndromes including in the subgroup of patients with pre-existing 
      coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS: The markedly improved overall survival with 
      fluoropyrimidines in patients with gastrointestinal cancer significantly 
      outweighs the small risk of cardiac arrhythmia and arrest. Oncologists should 
      take this into consideration for decision making to avoid undue clinical 
      conservatism, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Benefits and Risks Associated With Continuation of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor 
      After 24 Weeks of Pregnancy in Women With Inflammatory Bowel Disease : A 
      Nationwide Emulation Trial.
PG  - 1374-1382
LID - 10.7326/M22-0819 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuation of biologics for inflammatory disorders during pregnancy 
      is still a difficult decision. Many women with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) 
      stop anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment after 24 weeks. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate the benefits and risks of anti-TNF continuation after 24 weeks of 
      pregnancy for mothers with IBD and their offspring. DESIGN: Target trial 
      emulation between 2010 and 2020. SETTING: Nationwide population-based study using 
      the Système National des Données de Santé. PATIENTS: All pregnancies with birth 
      exposed to anti-TNF between conception and 24 weeks of pregnancy in women with 
      IBD. INTERVENTION: Continuation of anti-TNF after 24 weeks of pregnancy. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Occurrence of maternal IBD relapse up to 6 months after pregnancy, 
      adverse pregnancy outcomes, and serious infections in the offspring during the 
      first 5 years of life was compared according to anti-TNF continuation after 24 
      weeks of pregnancy using inverse probability-weighted marginal models. RESULTS: A 
      total of 5293 pregnancies were included; among them, anti-TNF treatment was 
      discontinued before 24 weeks for 2890 and continued beyond 24 weeks for 2403. 
      Continuation of anti-TNF was associated with decreased frequencies of maternal 
      IBD relapse (35.8% vs. 39.0%; adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 
      0.99]) and prematurity (7.6% vs. 8.9%; aRR, 0.82 [CI, 0.68 to 0.99]). No 
      difference according to anti-TNF continuation was found regarding stillbirths 
      (0.4% vs. 0.2%; aRR, 2.16 [CI, 0.64 to 7.81]), small weight for gestational age 
      births (13.1% vs. 12.9%; aRR, 1.01 [CI, 0.88 to 1.17]), and serious infections in 
      the offspring (54.2 vs. 50.2 per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.08 
      [CI, 0.94 to 1.25]). LIMITATION: Algorithms rather than clinical data were used 
      to identify patients with IBD, pregnancies, and serious infections. CONCLUSION: 
      Continuation of anti-TNF after 24 weeks of pregnancy appears beneficial regarding 
      IBD activity and prematurity, while not affecting neonatal outcomes and serious 
      infections in the offspring. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of bictegravir versus dolutegravir, raltegravir, and 
      efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy among treatment-naïve individuals with 
      HIV.
PG  - 86-92

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bictegravir or dolutegravir based antiretroviral therapy are 
      first-line HIV treatments. However, no trial has recruited enough participants to 
      estimate the most effective treatment, and there is little evidence on the 
      comparative effectiveness of bictegravir and other available antiretrovirals, 
      like efavirenz and raltegravir. METHODS: We emulated a four-arm target trial 
      using country-wide data from Mexico. The eligibility criteria of the target trial 
      were people with HIV, treatment naïve with viral load >500 copies/mL, without 
      tuberculosis, not pregnant, and started either bictegravir, dolutegravir, 
      efavirenz or raltegravir-based treatment between July 2019 and September 2021. 
      The main outcome was the probability of viral suppression (HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL) 
      at three months estimated using an adjusted logistic regression model, with 
      assignment assumed to be random within levels of adjusted covariates. 
      Probabilities were compared via differences and non-parametric bootstrapping was 
      used to calculate 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: 20,285 individuals were 
      included, of whom 84.3 % started bictegravir, 7.2 % dolutegravir, 6.6 % 
      efavirenz, and 1.8 % raltegravir. The adjusted probability of viral suppression 
      at 3 months was 79.4 % (79.4 %, 80.2 %) with bictegravir, 78.5 % (76.2 %, 81.1 %) 
      with dolutegravir, 63.9 % (60.6 %, 67.7 %) with efavirenz, and 69.8 % (63.8 %, 
      76.1 %) with raltegravir. When compared with bictegravir, this resulted in 
      differences of -0.8 % (-3.5 %, 1.9 %) for dolutegravir, -15.5 % (-19 %, -11.7 %) 
      for efavirenz, and -9.6 % (-15.9 %, -3.3 %) for raltegravir. Differences shrank 
      at twelve months and with a higher viral threshold (200 copies/mL). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Bictegravir was similar to dolutegravir and slightly more effective than 
      efavirenz or raltegravir at three months, but differences became negligible at 
      twelve months.

TI  - Early Convalescent Plasma Therapy and Mortality Among US Veterans Hospitalized 
      With Nonsevere COVID-19: An Observational Analysis Emulating a Target Trial.
PG  - 967-975

LID - jiab330
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early convalescent plasma transfusion may reduce mortality in 
      patients with nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This study 
      emulates a (hypothetical) target trial using observational data from a cohort of 
      US veterans admitted to a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility between 1 
      May and 17 November 2020 with nonsevere COVID-19. The intervention was 
      convalescent plasma initiated within 2 days of eligibility. Thirty-day mortality 
      was compared using cumulative incidence curves, risk differences, and hazard 
      ratios estimated from pooled logistic models with inverse probability weighting 
      to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: Of 11 269 eligible person-trials contributed 
      by 4755 patients, 402 trials were assigned to the convalescent plasma group. 
      Forty and 671 deaths occurred within the plasma and nonplasma groups, 
      respectively. The estimated 30-day mortality risk was 6.5% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 4.0%-9.7%) in the plasma group and 6.2% (95% CI, 5.6%-7.0%) in the 
      nonplasma group. The associated risk difference was 0.30% (95% CI, -2.30% to 
      3.60%) and the hazard ratio was 1.04 (95% CI, .64-1.62). CONCLUSIONS: Our target 
      trial emulation estimated no meaningful differences in 30-day mortality between 
      nonsevere COVID-19 patients treated and untreated with convalescent plasma.

TI  - Oseltamivir Treatment vs Supportive Care for Seasonal Influenza Requiring 
      Hospitalization.
PG  - e2514508
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14508 [doi]
LID - e2514508
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Current guidelines recommend oseltamivir treatment for all patients 
      hospitalized with influenza, but this guidance is based on suboptimal evidence. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes associated with oseltamivir treatment when 
      compared with supportive care for severe seasonal influenza requiring 
      hospitalization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort 
      study using target trial emulation included adult patients admitted to hospital 
      with influenza from 30 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 2015 to June 
      2023. Data were analyzed from November 2024 to March 2025. EXPOSURE: Oseltamivir 
      treatment on hospital day 0 or 1 vs supportive care without oseltamivir. MAIN 
      OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary 
      outcomes included time to being discharged alive and readmission within 30 days. 
      Overlap weighting of propensity scores was used to balance covariates, and a 
      competing risk model was used to compare time to being discharged alive. RESULTS: 
      Of 11 073 patients (mean [SD] age, 72.6 [16.8] years; 5793 female [52.3%]), there 
      were 7632 patients (68.9%) and 3441 patients (31.1%) in the oseltamivir and 
      supportive care groups, respectively. In hospital, 268 patients (3.5%) and 168 
      patients (4.9%) in the oseltamivir and supportive care groups died, respectively, 
      with an adjusted risk difference of -1.8% (95% CI, -2.8% to -0.9%; P < .001). The 
      oseltamivir treatment group was more likely to be discharged alive (adjusted 
      subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.25; P < .001). After 
      discharge, 645 patients (8.5%) and 336 patients (9.8%) were readmitted in the 
      oseltamivir and supportive care groups, respectively, with an adjusted risk 
      difference of -1.5% (95% CI, -2.8% to -0.2%; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with influenza, oseltamivir 
      treatment was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality risk, earlier 
      discharge, and lower readmission rate, supporting evidence for the current 
      guideline recommendation of oseltamivir treatment for severe influenza. Clinical 
      trials are needed to definitively answer this question.

TI  - Associations Between Reductions in Depressive Symptoms and Reductions in Pain and 
      Anxiety Symptoms and Substance Use: Emulation of a Randomized Trial.
PG  - 100258
LID - 10.1016/j.focus.2024.100258 [doi]
LID - 100258
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Depressive symptoms are linked with pain, anxiety, and substance 
      use. Research estimating whether a reduction in depressive symptoms is linked to 
      subsequent reductions in pain and anxiety symptoms and substance use is limited. 
      METHODS: Using data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, a multisite 
      observational study of U.S. veterans, the authors used a target trial emulation 
      framework to compare individuals with elevated depressive symptoms (Patient 
      Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥ 10) who experienced reductions in depressive 
      symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score < 10) with those whose symptoms 
      persisted (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥ 10) at the next follow-up visit 
      (on average, 1 year later). Using inverse probability of treatment weighting, the 
      authors estimated ORs and 95% CIs for associations between depressive symptom 
      reduction status and improvement on the following: anxiety symptoms, pain 
      symptoms, unhealthy alcohol use, and use of tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, and/or 
      illicit opioids. RESULTS: Reductions in depressive symptoms were associated with 
      reductions in pain symptoms (OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.01, 2.02), anxiety symptoms 
      (OR=2.50, 95% CI=1.63, 3.83), and illicit opioid use (OR=2.07, 95% CI=1.13, 
      3.81). Depressive symptom reductions were not associated with reductions in 
      unhealthy alcohol use (OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.48, 1.52) or use of tobacco (OR=1.49, 
      95% CI=0.89, 2.48), cannabis (OR=1.07, 95% CI=0.63, 1.83), or cocaine (OR=1.28, 
      95% CI=0.73, 2.24). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing depressive symptoms may potentially 
      reduce pain and anxiety symptoms and illicit opioid use. Future work should 
      determine whether reductions achieved through antidepressant medications, 
      behavioral therapy, or other means have comparable impact.

LID - 10.1016/j.chest.2024.10.038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may experience 
      insomnia and use hypnotics. However, the effect of the use of hypnotics on their 
      clinical course remains unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the use of hypnotics 
      associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with IPF? STUDY DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: This study included 99 patients with IPF from the Hamamatsu 
      hospital-based cohort and 123 patients with IPF from the Seirei hospital-based 
      cohort, as well as 30,218 patients with IPF from the National Database of Health 
      Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (the NDB cohort). To 
      analyze the association of hypnotics use with outcomes avoiding immortal time 
      bias, multivariable Cox models with time-dependent covariates and target trial 
      emulation with a new user design were used for the hospital- and NDB-based 
      cohorts. RESULTS: In the cohorts studied, the 3-year cumulative incidence of new 
      use of hypnotics following the IPF diagnosis ranged from 13.4% to 24.1%. In both 
      hospital-based cohorts, the continuous use of hypnotics was associated with an 
      increased risk of all-cause mortality and disease progression. In the NDB cohort, 
      the continuous use of hypnotics was also associated with an increased risk of 
      all-cause mortality. Subgroup analysis found associations between the continuous 
      use of hypnotics and increased mortality regardless of sex and comorbidities, 
      excluding certain subpopulations. INTERPRETATION: This study found that 
      continuous use of hypnotics was associated with an increased risk of mortality in 
      patients with IPF. Given the relatively high cumulative incidence of hypnotics 
      use in this population, there is an urgent need to reassess the appropriate use 
      of hypnotics for patients with IPF.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Switching to Bictegravir From Dolutegravir-, 
      Efavirenz-, or Raltegravir-Based Antiretroviral Therapy Among Individuals With 
      HIV Who are Virologically Suppressed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of switching to bictegravir 
      in maintaining an undetectable viral load (<50 copies/mL) among people with HIV 
      (PWH) as compared with continuing dolutegravir-, efavirenz-, or raltegravir-based 
      antiretroviral therapy using nationwide observational data from Mexico. METHODS: 
      We emulated 3 target trials comparing switching to bictegravir vs continuing with 
      dolutegravir, efavirenz, or raltegravir. Eligibility criteria were PWH aged ≥16 
      years with a viral load <50 copies/mL and at least 3 months of current 
      antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir, efavirenz, or raltegravir) between July 
      2019 and September 2021. Weekly target trials were emulated during the study 
      period, and individuals were included in every emulation if they continued to be 
      eligible. The main outcome was the probability of an undetectable viral load at 3 
      months, which was estimated via an adjusted logistic regression model. Estimated 
      probabilities were compared via differences, and 95% CIs were calculated via 
      bootstrap. Outcomes were also ascertained at 12 months, and sensitivity analyses 
      were performed to test our analytic choices. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 3 028 
      619 PWH (63 581 unique individuals). The probability of an undetectable viral 
      load at 3 months was 2.9% (95% CI, 1.9%-3.8%), 1.3% (95% CI, .9%-1.6%), and 1.2% 
      (95% CI, .8%-1.7%) higher when switching to bictegravir vs continuing with 
      dolutegravir, efavirenz, and raltegravir, respectively. Similar results were 
      observed at 12 months and in other sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that switching to bictegravir could be more effective in 
      maintaining viral suppression than continuing with dolutegravir, efavirenz, or 
      raltegravir.

TI  - Time to direct-acting antiviral initiation and liver-related events in people 
      with HIV and hepatitis C virus.
PG  - 1074-1079
LID - 10.1097/QAD.0000000000004161 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection need 
      antiretroviral treatment (ART) to suppress HIV and direct-acting antivirals 
      (DAAs) to cure HCV. ART is typically prioritized, but delays in DAA initiation 
      may increase the risk of liver-related events and HCV transmission to others. 
      DESIGN: Target trial emulation with observational data collected in routine 
      clinical practice from a collaboration of cohorts from Europe and North America. 
      METHODS: We included DAA-naive adults with HIV-HCV co-infection who achieved HIV 
      virologic suppression (HIV RNA <50 copies/ml) after starting ART between 2013 and 
      2020. We estimated the probability of not initiating DAAs at 6 and 36 months 
      after HIV virologic suppression and emulated a target trial of early (≤6 months 
      after HIV virological suppression) versus delayed (>6 months) DAA initiation and 
      the 36-month risk of liver-related events (liver decompensation or hepatocellular 
      carcinoma). RESULTS: Of 862 eligible individuals (median age 46 years; 
      interquartile range 36-56), 14% were women, and 52% had a history of injection 
      drug use. The 6-month and 36-month probabilities of not initiating DAA were 58% 
      [95% confidence interval (CI): 55-61] and 24% (21-27), respectively. The 36-month 
      risk of liver-related events was 1.1% (0.4-2.0) for early initiation and 1.7% 
      (0.7-2.5) for delayed initiation; risk difference -0.5% (-1.2 to 0.4). 
      CONCLUSION: Almost one-quarter of people with HIV-HCV co-infection on ART had not 
      initiated DAA 3 years after HIV virologic suppression. Because the 3-year risk of 
      liver-related events was low, estimates of the impact of delayed DAA initiation 
      were imprecise.

TI  - Assessing the Risk for Falls in Older Adults After Initiating Gabapentin Versus 
      Duloxetine.
PG  - 187-198
LID - 10.7326/ANNALS-24-00636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evidence informing the harms of gabapentin use are at risk of 
      bias from comparing users with nonusers. OBJECTIVE: To describe the risk for 
      fall-related outcomes in older adults starting treatment with gabapentin versus 
      duloxetine. DESIGN: New user, active comparator study using a target trial 
      emulation framework. SETTING: MarketScan (IBM) commercial claims between January 
      2014 and December 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years or older with diabetic 
      neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, or fibromyalgia and without depression, 
      anxiety, seizures, or cancer in the 365 days before cohort entry. INTERVENTION: 
      New initiation of treatment with gabapentin or duloxetine (comparator). 
      MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the hazard of experiencing any fall-related 
      visit in the 6 months after initiating gabapentin or duloxetine until 
      discontinuation of treatment. Secondary outcomes were hazard of severe 
      fall-related events defined as a fall associated with hip fracture or emergency 
      department visit or hospitalization associated with a fall. Stabilized inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for baseline 
      characteristics. RESULTS: Our analytic cohort included 57 086 older adults with a 
      diagnosis of interest initiating treatment with gabapentin (n = 52 152) or 
      duloxetine (n = 4934). Overall median follow-up duration was 30 days (IQR, 30 to 
      90 days). Weighted cumulative incidence of a fall-related visit per 1000 
      person-years at 30, 90, and 180 days was 103.60, 90.44, and 84.44 for gabapentin 
      users and 203.43, 177.73, and 158.21 for duloxetine users, respectively. At 
      6-month follow-up, incident gabapentin users had lower hazard of falls (hazard 
      ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64]), but there was no difference in the hazards 
      of experiencing severe falls. Results were similar across sensitivity and 
      subgroup analyses. LIMITATION: Claims may contain fewer frail adults and 
      undercount falls. CONCLUSION: Compared with incident use of duloxetine, incident 
      use of gabapentin was not associated with increased fall-related visits. PRIMARY 
      FUNDING SOURCE: None.

TI  - Epidemiological surveillance of drug safety using cumulative sequential analysis 
      in electronic healthcare data.
PG  - 129-140
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methods for safety signal detection in electronic healthcare data 
      analysing data sequentially are being developed to meet the limitations of 
      spontaneous reporting systems. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to provide an overview 
      of the literature on sequential analysis of electronic healthcare data and 
      describe the development and testing of a novel epidemiological surveillance 
      system. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and 
      the Cochrane Library applying similar in- and exclusion criteria as those of a 
      previous systematic review. The proposed system consisted of repeated cohort 
      studies and was tested in an emulated prospective setting. Two signal evaluations 
      were performed with several sensitivity analyses and a target trial emulation. 
      FINDINGS: In the literature, 11 studies analysed the data sequentially of which 
      two applied traditional epidemiological methods. Epidemiological surveillance of 
      several exposures and outcomes can be successfully conducted with the newly 
      proposed sequential analysis of electronic healthcare data. Signal evaluation 
      studies confirmed the results of the system. CONCLUSIONS: Very few studies in the 
      literature analysed data at multiple time points, although this seems to be a 
      prerequisite for testing the methods in a realistic setting. We demonstrated the 
      feasibility of a sequential surveillance system using electronic healthcare data.

TI  - Levothyroxine initiation and the risk of pregnancy loss among pregnant women with 
      subclinical hypothyroidism: An observational study emulating a target trial.
PG  - 470-481
LID - 10.1111/ppe.13015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the benefits of levothyroxine are well-established for overt 
      hypothyroidism, they are unclear for subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) among 
      pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of initiation of levothyroxine 
      on pregnancy loss among women with SCH with an emulated target trial using 
      observational data. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using the United 
      Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to account for the staggered timing 
      of diagnosis and treatment of SCH and the time of entry of women into prenatal 
      care. We emulated multiple nested trials (at each gestational week) and used an 
      intention-to-treat approach to define levothyroxine use (≥1 prescription in the 
      7 days prior to trial entry), with eligible users matched to non-users (1:4) on 
      time of diagnosis, gestational week of the first eligible trial and 
      high-dimensional propensity score. Pregnancy losses included spontaneous abortion 
      and stillbirth. A pooled logistic regression model with bootstrap resampling was 
      used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
      RESULTS: Based on 159,177 eligible person-trials (5781 women), the matched cohort 
      included 181 initiators and 640 non-initiators of levothyroxine, with 57 
      pregnancy losses occurring during follow-up. Overall, the mean age of women was 
      32.2 years (SD 5.4), 25% were obese, 8% had type 2 diabetes and about 50% were 
      nulliparous. After matching, women who initiated levothyroxine versus not had 
      higher thyroid-stimulating levels during pregnancy and were more likely to have a 
      history of hypothyroidism. The cumulative incidence of pregnancy loss was lower 
      in initiators versus non-initiators of levothyroxine. The adjusted HR for 
      pregnancy loss was 0.87 (95% CI 0.22, 1.56). CONCLUSIONS: Although our assessment 
      of the effect of initiation of levothyroxine for SCH in pregnancy precludes any 
      definitive conclusions due to wide confidence intervals, this study illustrates 
      the feasibility of using the target trial emulation framework to examine the 
      effectiveness of medication use in pregnancy.

TI  - Emulating Target Trials to Study Perioperative and Critical Care Interventions 
      with Observational Data: Promise and Limitations.
PG  - 611-627
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000005308 [doi]
AB  - Estimating effects of interventions is a central task in perioperative and 
      critical care outcomes research. While randomized trials remain the accepted 
      standard for causal inference, trial data are not always available to inform 
      clinical decisions, and some questions cannot be answered feasibly or efficiently 
      with trials. In these settings, studies using observational healthcare data may 
      be used to inform practice. Causal inference from observational data has been 
      reconsidered in recent years, challenging the prevailing notion among clinical 
      researchers that causal conclusions cannot be drawn from observational studies. 
      The "target trial framework" is one contribution within a growing methodologic 
      field that helps investigators avoid common pitfalls in observational study 
      design and analysis. Importantly, researchers must understand which biases this 
      framework can-and cannot-help avoid. The authors present an overview of target 
      trial emulation and describe the promise and limitations of this framework for 
      improving observational perioperative and critical care outcomes research.

TI  - Early β-Blocker Use and Clinical Outcomes in Acute Myocardial Injury: A 
      Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 1090-1098.e6
LID - S0002-9343(25)00140-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.amjmed.2025.02.029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial injury is defined by elevated cardiac troponin 
      levels with a rising and/or falling pattern, and is associated with increased 
      mortality risk compared to patients without myocardial injury. The role of 
      β-blockers in patients with acute myocardial injury remains unclear. METHODS: 
      This multicenter, retrospective cohort study used data from the Tianjin Health 
      and Medical Data Platform to assess the impact of early β-blocker use on 1-year 
      all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in acute 
      myocardial injury patients, employing a new user and target trial emulation 
      design. Propensity score matching was applied, and Cox regression was used to 
      calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: After 
      propensity score matching, a total of 25,966 participants were included: 8667 to 
      the β-blocker group and 17,299 to the non-β-blocker group. A total of 4113 deaths 
      (15.8%) and 5795 MACE (22.3%) occurred. Compared with nonusers, β-blocker was 
      associated with the reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 
      0.83-0.95) and MACE (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85-0.95). In the subgroup analysis, 
      β-blockers were associated with a significantly reduced risk of mortality in 
      patients without stroke (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.93), while no significant 
      association was observed in patients with stroke (HR 1.04, 95% CI: 0.93-1.16). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Early use of β-blockers is associated with the reduced risk of 
      1-year mortality in patients with acute myocardial injury. To more accurately 
      assess the therapeutic effects, prospective trials are necessary, and these data 
      provide key research directions for future trials.

TI  - The perpetual need of randomized clinical trials: challenges and uncertainties in 
      emulating the REDUCE-AMI trial.
PG  - 343-347
LID - 10.1007/s10654-024-01127-3 [doi]
AB  - Trial emulations in observational data analyses can complement findings from 
      randomized clinical trials, inform future trial designs, or generate evidence 
      when randomized studies are not feasible due to resource constraints and ethical 
      or practical limitations. Importantly, trial emulation designs facilitate causal 
      inference in observational data analyses by enhancing counterfactual thinking and 
      comparisons of real-world observations (e.g. Mendelian Randomization) to 
      hypothetical interventions. In order to enhance credibility, trial emulations 
      would benefit from prospective registration, publication of statistical analysis 
      plans, and subsequent prospective benchmarking to randomized clinical trials 
      prior to their publication. Confounding by indication, however, is the key 
      challenge to interpreting observed intended effects of an intervention as causal 
      in observational data analyses. We discuss the target trial emulation of the 
      REDUCE-AMI randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03278509; 
      beta-blocker use in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction 
      after myocardial infarction) to illustrate the challenges and uncertainties of 
      studying intended effects of interventions without randomization to account for 
      confounding. We furthermore directly compare the findings, statistical power, and 
      clinical interpretation of the results of the REDUCE-AMI target trial emulation 
      to those from the simultaneously published randomized clinical trial. The 
      complexity and subtlety of confounding by indication when studying intended 
      effects of interventions can generally only be addressed by randomization.

TI  - Testosterone Replacement Reduces Morbidity and Mortality for Most Patients With 
      Cirrhosis.
LID - S1542-3565(25)00200-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2025.02.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many men with cirrhosis have low testosterone levels. This is 
      associated with sarcopenia, anemia, and poor quality of life. Data are lacking, 
      however, regarding the clinical impact of testosterone replacement. METHODS: We 
      conducted an emulated clinical trial evaluating the impact of testosterone 
      replacement among men who were diagnosed with hypogonadism at the same time as 
      their diagnosis of cirrhosis (new user design). We used nationally representative 
      Medicare data (2008-2020) to examine the risk of death, decompensation events, 
      and fractures in patients who did or did not receive testosterone. We balanced 
      treated and untreated with inverse probability of treatment weighting and 
      evaluated outcomes using an intention-to-treat design. RESULTS: A total of 282 
      patients (7.4%) with testicular hypofunction and cirrhosis received testosterone 
      replacement after diagnosis. Patients started on testosterone spent 28.6% of 
      patient-days on therapy, and patients not started would spend 0.5% of 
      patient-days on therapy (P < .0001). Testosterone use was associated with lower 
      mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.85-0.99). Testosterone also led to a lower risk of new decompensation 
      events (sHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99) and especially for ascites requiring 
      paracentesis (sHR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.89) and variceal hemorrhage (sHR, 0.67; 
      95% CI, 0.54-0.85) with less effect on hepatic encephalopathy requiring 
      hospitalization (sHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84-1.01) and fractures (sHR, 0.99; 95% CI, 
      0.91-1.08) and without increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (sHR, 1.09; 95% 
      CI, 0.91-1.3). There was substantial heterogeneity of treatment effect across 
      baseline subgroups. CONCLUSION: In our target trial emulation of a nationally 
      representative cohort of older patients with cirrhosis and hypogonadism, 
      testosterone use improved clinical outcomes.

TI  - Inference procedures in sequential trial emulation with survival outcomes: 
      Comparing confidence intervals based on the sandwich variance estimator, 
      bootstrap and jackknife.
PG  - 9622802251356594
LID - 10.1177/09622802251356594 [doi]
AB  - Sequential trial emulation (STE) is an approach to estimating causal treatment 
      effects by emulating a sequence of target trials from observational data. In STE, 
      inverse probability weighting is commonly utilised to address time-varying 
      confounding and/or dependent censoring. Then structural models for potential 
      outcomes are applied to the weighted data to estimate treatment effects. For 
      inference, the simple sandwich variance estimator is popular but conservative, 
      while nonparametric bootstrap is computationally expensive, and a more efficient 
      alternative, linearised estimating function (LEF) bootstrap, has not been adapted 
      to STE. We evaluated the performance of various methods for constructing 
      confidence intervals (CIs) of marginal risk differences in STE with survival 
      outcomes by comparing the coverage of CIs based on nonparametric/LEF bootstrap, 
      jackknife, and the sandwich variance estimator through simulations. LEF bootstrap 
      CIs demonstrated better coverage than nonparametric bootstrap CIs and 
      sandwich-variance-estimator-based CIs with small/moderate sample sizes, low event 
      rates and low treatment prevalence, which were the motivating scenarios for STE. 
      They were less affected by treatment group imbalance and faster to compute than 
      nonparametric bootstrap CIs. With large sample sizes and medium/high event rates, 
      the sandwich-variance-estimator-based CIs had the best coverage and were the 
      fastest to compute. These findings offer guidance in constructing CIs in causal 
      survival analysis using STE.

TI  - Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers and Kidney Outcomes.
PG  - 1880-1886
LID - 10.1007/s11606-024-08762-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early trials of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DCCBs) 
      suggest a detrimental effect on intraglomerular pressure and an association with 
      albuminuria. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the associations of DCCB initiation 
      with albuminuria and kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) and to 
      determine whether renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade modified these 
      associations. DESIGN: We conducted a target trial emulation study using a new 
      user, active comparator design and electronic health record data from Geisinger 
      Health. PARTICIPANTS: We included patients without severe albuminuria or KFRT who 
      were initiated on a DCCB or thiazide (active comparator) between January 1, 2004, 
      and December 31, 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Using inverse probability of treatment 
      weighting, we performed doubly robust Cox proportional hazards regression to 
      estimate the association of DCCB initiation with incident severe albuminuria 
      (urine albumin to creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g) and KFRT, overall and stratified 
      by RAS blocker use. KEY RESULTS: There were 11,747 and 26,758 eligible patients 
      initiating a DCCB and thiazide, respectively, with a weighted baseline mean age 
      of 60 years, systolic blood pressure of 143 mm Hg, and eGFR of 86 mL/min/1.73 
      m(2), and with a mean follow-up of 8 years. Compared with thiazides, DCCBs were 
      significantly associated with the development of severe albuminuria (hazard ratio 
      [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.43), with attenuation of risk in 
      the presence of RAS blockade (P for interaction < 0.001). The risk of KFRT was 
      increased among patients without RAS blockade (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.19-2.31), but 
      not with RAS blockade (P for interaction = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: DCCBs were 
      associated with increased risk of albuminuria and, in the absence of RAS 
      blockade, KFRT. These findings suggest coupling DCCB therapy with RAS blockade 
      may mitigate adverse kidney outcomes.

TI  - Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients With Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Without 
      Symptomatic Atherosclerotic Disease.
PG  - e2339715
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.39715 [doi]
LID - e2339715
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm have a high risk of ischemic 
      events associated with concomitant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and 
      current clinical practice guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy to mitigate 
      this risk. However, in patients with aneurysms without symptomatic 
      atherosclerosis, the benefit of antiplatelet therapy has been sparsely 
      investigated. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of antiplatelets on the risk of 
      ischemic events and bleeding in individuals with abdominal aneurysms with no 
      symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      A comparative effectiveness research study using a target trial emulation 
      framework was performed. Population-based, cross-linked observational data from 
      Danish national health registries containing comprehensive, individual-level 
      information on all Danish citizens were used to evaluate patients who were 
      antiplatelet-naive and diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms, with no record 
      of symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease, from January 1, 2010, through 
      August 21, 2021. EXPOSURE: Prescription filled for aspirin or clopidogrel. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of ischemic events (myocardial infarction and/or 
      ischemic stroke) and risk of major bleeding. For target trial emulation, trials 
      were emulated as sequential, contingent on patient eligibility at the time of 
      inclusion, and were evaluated by means of pooled logistic regression models to 
      estimate the intention-to-treat and as-treated effects, expressed as hazard ratio 
      (HR) and event-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 6344 patients (65.2% men; age, 
      72 [IQR, 64-78] years) provided 131 047 trial cases; 3363 of these cases involved 
      initiation of antiplatelet therapy and 127 684 did not. A total of 182 ischemic 
      events occurred among initiators and 5602 ischemic events occurred among 
      noninitiators, corresponding to an intention-to-treat HR of 0.91 (95% CI, 
      0.73-1.17) and an estimated absolute event-free survival difference of -0.6% (95% 
      CI, -1.7% to 0.5%). After censoring nonadherent person-time, the treatment HR was 
      0.90 (95% CI, 0.68-1.20), with similar risk difference. For bleeding, the 
      intention-to-treat HR was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.97-1.58) and the event-free survival 
      difference was 1.0%. The treatment HR was 1.21 (95% CI, 0.82-1.72); the risk 
      difference was similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, no evidence of 
      effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy to lower the risk of ischemic events and a 
      trend toward higher bleeding risk was noted. The observed differences between the 
      treatment groups were minimal, suggesting limited clinical relevance of 
      antiplatelet treatment.

TI  - Randomized Trial Replication Using Observational Data for Comparative 
      Effectiveness of Secukinumab and Ustekinumab in Psoriasis: A Study From the 
      British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register.
PG  - 66-73
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.4202 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Treatments for psoriasis may be less effective in everyday practice 
      than in clinical trials. Emulating a target trial using data from the British 
      Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register (BADBIR) 
      can provide treatment effect estimates that are robust and can inform both 
      clinicians and regulatory bodies. OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative 
      effectiveness of ustekinumab and secukinumab in patients with psoriasis, and to 
      test whether the relative effectiveness estimate of the CLEAR trial, a randomized 
      clinical trial that compared secukinumab with ustekinumab for psoriasis, can be 
      replicated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness 
      research study used a target trial emulation approach and was performed between 
      November 2007 and August 2019. Data were obtained from BADBIR, a multicenter 
      longitudinal pharmacovigilance register of patients with moderate to severe 
      psoriasis in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. Participants had chronic 
      plaque psoriasis, were 18 years or older, and had at least 1 record of a 
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 12 or higher before their initiation 
      to secukinumab or ustekinumab. Propensity score (PS) 1:1 matched analysis and 
      inverse probability treatment weighted analysis were performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the risk ratio (RR) and the risk difference 
      (RD) for achieving PASI of 2 or lower after 12 months of therapy for secukinumab 
      compared with ustekinumab. Methods to account for missing outcome data were 
      complete case analysis, nonresponder imputation, last observation carried 
      forward, inverse probability of censoring weighting, and multiple imputation. 
      Regulatory and estimate agreement metrics were used to benchmark the effect 
      estimates in this study against those in the CLEAR trial. RESULTS: A total of 
      1231 patients were included in the analysis, with 917 receiving ustekinumab and 
      314 receiving secukinumab. Secukinumab was superior to ustekinumab in all 
      analyses, except under the nonresponder imputation method, in the proportion of 
      participants achieving a PASI of 2 or lower (PS-weighted complete case analysis: 
      RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.06-1.55]; RD, 11.9% [1.6-22.1]). All analyses, except for 
      nonresponder imputation, reached regulatory agreement in both PS-matching and 
      PS-weighted analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This comparative effectiveness 
      study found that secukinumab resulted in more patients achieving a PASI of 2 or 
      lower after 12 months of therapy compared with ustekinumab in patients with 
      psoriasis. Target trial emulation in this study resulted in regulatory and 
      estimate agreement with the CLEAR randomized clinical trial; further such studies 
      may help fill the evidence gap when comparing other systemic therapies for 
      psoriasis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in 
      reducing incidence of distal vs. proximal colorectal cancer (CRC) in persons aged 
      55-69 years. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using observational data from a German 
      claims database (German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database), we emulated a 
      target trial with two arms: Colonoscopy screening vs. no-screening at baseline. 
      Adjusted cumulative incidence of total, distal, and proximal CRC over 11 years of 
      follow-up was estimated in 55-69-year-olds at an average CRC risk and without 
      colonoscopy, polypectomy, or fecal occult blood test before baseline. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 307,158 persons were included (screening arm: 198,389 and control arm: 
      117,399). The adjusted 11-year risk of any CRC was 1.62% in the screening group 
      and 2.38% in the no-screening group resulting in a relative risk of 0.68 (95% CI: 
      0.63-0.73). The relative risk was 0.67 for distal CRC (95% CI: 0.62-0.73) and 
      0.70 (95% CI: 0.63-0.79) for proximal CRC. The cumulative incidence curves of the 
      groups crossed after 6.7 (distal CRC) and 5.0 years (proximal CRC). CONCLUSION: 
      Our results suggest that colonoscopy is effective in preventing distal and 
      proximal CRC. Unlike previous studies not using a target trial approach, we found 
      no relevant difference in the effectiveness by location.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stopping renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) after an episode 
      of hyperkalemia is common but may involve therapeutic compromises, in that the 
      cessation of RASi deprives patients of their beneficial cardiovascular effects. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Observational study from the Stockholm Creatinine 
      Measurements (SCREAM) project including patients initiating RASi in routine care 
      and surviving a first-detected episode of hyperkalemia (potassium >5.0 mmol/L). 
      We used target trial emulation techniques based on cloning, censoring and 
      weighting to compare stopping vs. continuing RASi within 6 months after 
      hyperkalemia. Outcomes were 3-year risks of mortality, major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (MACE, composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial 
      infarction and stroke hospitalization) and recurrent hyperkalemia. Of 5669 new 
      users of RASi who developed hyperkalemia (median age 72 years, 44% women), 1425 
      (25%) stopped RASi therapy within 6 months. Compared with continuing RASi, 
      stopping therapy was associated with a higher 3-year risk of death (absolute risk 
      difference 10.8%; HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.34-1.64) and MACE (risk difference 4.7%; HR 
      1.29, 1.14-1.45), but a lower risk of recurrent hyperkalemia (risk difference 
      -9.5%; HR 0.76, 0.69-0.84). Results were consistent for events following 
      potassium of >5.0 or >5.5 mmol/L, after censoring when the treatment decision was 
      changed, across prespecified subgroups, and after adjusting for albuminuria. 
      CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that stopping RASi after hyperkalemia may be 
      associated with a lower risk of recurrence of hyperkalemia, but higher risk of 
      death and cardiovascular events.

TI  - Transcarotid Artery Revascularization Versus Carotid Endarterectomy With and 
      Without High-Risk Criteria: A National Target Trial.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000006825 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate outcomes associated with transcarotid artery 
      revascularization with flow reversal(TCAR) versus carotid endarterectomy(CEA) for 
      carotid artery stenosis(CAS), emulating a randomized controlled trial. SUMMARY 
      BACKGROUND DATA: The introduction of TCAR has revolutionized management of CAS. 
      While this approach has been demonstrated to yield reduced morbidity relative to 
      transfemoral carotid artery stenting, a comparison of outcomes with gold-standard 
      CEA remains lacking. METHODS: We identified all records entailing CEA or TCAR for 
      CAS within the 2021-2022 Nationwide Readmissions Database. We conducted a target 
      trial emulation using doubly robust inverse probability-weighted regression 
      analysis to evaluate the adjusted hazard of 90-day composite morbidity, comprised 
      of in-hospital stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. Patients were further 
      stratified as high- or low-risk based on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
      Services(CMS) criteria. RESULTS: We identified 113,994 patients who received CEA, 
      and 12,613 TCAR. The adjusted risk of composite morbidity over 90 days following 
      revascularization was 4.1% (CI 3.6-4.6%) following TCAR compared with 4.1% (CI 
      4.0-4.3%) after CEA. The average treatment effect of TCAR was not found to be 
      significant. Target trial emulation revealed TCAR to confer similar hazard of 
      90-day composite morbidity as CEA among low-risk patients (HR 0.85, CI 
      0.72-1.01), but reduced hazard of myocardial infarction among high-risk patients 
      (HR 0.76, CI 0.58-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Upon target trial emulation, receipt of 
      TCAR was associated with comparable morbidity over 90 days following 
      revascularization, relative to CEA. Altogether, our data support recent CMS 
      approval of TCAR, and encourage broadened utilization among both standard and 
      high-risk patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of early intensive in-hospital 
      rehabilitation, initiated within 2 days of surgery and lasting up to 7 days, on 
      the recovery of activities of daily living in patients with and without dementia. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Medical claims data from 925 hospitals in Japan were 
      analyzed. We enrolled patients aged ≥50 years who underwent hip fracture surgery 
      within 2 days of admission between April 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. Low- 
      (20 minutes per day starting on day 2), highest- (60 minutes per day starting on 
      day 1), and gradually increasing (20 minutes on day 1, 40 minutes on days 2-4, 
      and 60 minutes per day thereafter) intensity regimens were used as exposures. The 
      outcomes were Barthel Index (BI) scores at 14 and 30 days postoperatively. For 
      per-protocol analysis, a target trial emulation framework with the sequential 
      doubly robust estimator was used. RESULTS: Among patients without dementia 
      (N = 11,461), no significant differences in BI scores were observed at 14 days 
      postoperatively across regimens. At 30 days postoperatively, significant 
      differences in BI scores were noted between highest- and low-intensity regimens 
      and between gradually increasing intensity and low-intensity regimens, with 
      additive BI scores of 15.2 (95% CI, 10.7-19.7) and 14.7 (95% CI, 9.2-20.2), 
      respectively. In patients with dementia (N = 14,302), significant differences in 
      BI scores were noted at 14 days postoperatively between highest- and 
      low-intensity regimens and between gradually increasing intensity and 
      low-intensity regimens, with additive BI scores of 8.7 (95% CI, 5.2-12.2) and 
      10.7 (95% CI, 5.8-15.6), respectively. At 30 days postoperatively, a significant 
      difference in BI scores was observed between gradually increasing intensity and 
      low-intensity regimens, with an additive BI score of 17.9 (95% CI, 11.3-24.5). 
      CONCLUSION: Early intensive in-hospital rehabilitation is highly relevant and 
      beneficial for dementia patients.

TI  - Adverse renal events between ranibizumab and aflibercept in patients with 
      diabetic macular oedema in Taiwan: a comparative cohort study.

AB  - AIMS: To assess and compare the risk of adverse renal events among patients with 
      diabetic macular oedema (DME) who were treated with either intravitreal 
      ranibizumab or aflibercept in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a population-based 
      retrospective cohort study and employed a target trial emulation framework using 
      Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database from 2011 to 2018.Patients aged over 
      20 years diagnosed with DME and receiving treatment with either intravitreal 
      aflibercept or ranibizumab were included. We applied propensity score methods to 
      ensure balance in the baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups. 
      The primary outcomes were the adverse renal events, specifically acute renal 
      injury and hospitalisation due to renal events. We employed Cox proportional 
      hazards models to estimate the HRs associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: A 
      total of 6330 patients receiving ranibizumab and 1258 patients receiving 
      aflibercept were included in this study. The incidence rates of adverse renal 
      events were 102.2 and 138.7 per 1000 person-years for ranibizumab and 
      aflibercept, respectively. Patients treated with intravitreal aflibercept had a 
      significantly higher risk of experiencing a composite of adverse renal events 
      (HR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.63), compared with those treated with ranibizumab, 
      and specifically also a higher risk of acute kidney injury (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 
      1.08 to 1.63) and hospitalisation due to renal events (HR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.25 to 
      1.64). CONCLUSION: In comparison to ranibizumab, the intravitreal use of 
      aflibercept was associated with a greater risk of adverse renal events. These 
      findings provide a solid foundation for future studies to validate these results 
      further.

TI  - Coronary Assessment in Heart Failure within a Safety-Net Setting: Disparities and 
      Outcomes.
LID - 2023.07.06.23292331 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.07.06.23292331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though ischemic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of heart failure 
      (HF), most patients do not undergo coronary assessment after heart failure 
      diagnosis. In a safety-net population, referral patterns have not been studied, 
      and it is unknown whether coronary assessment is associated with improved HF 
      outcomes. METHODS: Using an electronic health record cohort of all individuals 
      with HF within San Francisco Health Network from 2001-2019, we identified factors 
      associated with completion of coronary assessment (invasive coronary angiography, 
      nuclear stress, or coronary computed tomographic angiography). Then we emulated a 
      randomized clinical trial of elective coronary assessment with outcomes of 
      all-cause mortality and a composite outcome of mortality and emergent 
      angiography. We used propensity scores to account for differences between groups. 
      We used national death records to improve ascertainment of mortality. RESULTS: 
      Among 14,829 individuals with HF (median 62 years old, 5,855 [40%] women), 3,987 
      (26.9%) ever completed coronary assessment, with 2,467 (18.5%) assessed out of 
      13,301 with unknown CAD status at HF diagnosis. Women and older individuals were 
      less likely to complete coronary assessment, with differences by race/ethnicity, 
      medical history, substance use, housing, and echocardiographic findings. Among 
      5,972 eligible for inclusion in the "target trial," 627 underwent early elective 
      coronary assessment and 5,345 did not. Coronary assessment was associated with 
      lower mortality (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72-0.97; p=0.025), reduced risk of the 
      composite outcome, higher rates of revascularization, and higher use of medical 
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a safety-net population, disparities in coronary 
      assessment after HF diagnosis are not fully explained by CAD risk factors. Our 
      target trial emulation suggests coronary assessment is associated with improved 
      HF outcomes possibly related to higher rates of revascularization and GDMT use, 
      but with low certainty that this is finding is not attributable to unmeasured 
      confounding.

      for Treatment Sequences in Health Technology Assessments.
PG  - 487-506

AB  - With an ever-increasing number of treatment options, the assessment of treatment 
      sequences has become crucial in health technology assessment (HTA). This review 
      systematically explores the multifaceted challenges inherent in evaluating 
      sequences, delving into their interplay and nuances that go beyond economic model 
      structures. We synthesised a 'roadmap' of literature from key methodological 
      studies, highlighting the evolution of recent advances and emerging research 
      themes. These insights were compared against HTA guidelines to identify potential 
      avenues for future research. Our findings reveal a spectrum of challenges in 
      sequence evaluation, encompassing selecting appropriate decision-analytic 
      modelling approaches and comparators, deriving appropriate clinical effectiveness 
      evidence in the face of data scarcity, scrutinising effectiveness assumptions and 
      statistical adjustments, considering treatment displacement, and optimising model 
      computations. Integrating methodologies from diverse disciplines-statistics, 
      epidemiology, causal inference, operational research and computer science-has 
      demonstrated promise in addressing these challenges. An updated review of 
      application studies is warranted to provide detailed insights into the extent and 
      manner in which these methodologies have been implemented. Data scarcity on the 
      effectiveness of treatment sequences emerged as a dominant concern, especially 
      because treatment sequences are rarely compared in clinical trials. Real-world 
      data (RWD) provide an alternative means for capturing evidence on 
      effectiveness and future research should prioritise harnessing causal inference 
      methods, particularly Target Trial Emulation, to evaluate treatment sequence 
      effectiveness using RWD. This approach is also adaptable for analysing trials 
      harbouring sequencing information and adjusting indirect comparisons when 
      collating evidence from heterogeneous sources. Such investigative efforts could

TI  - Effectiveness of Sotrovimab in Preventing COVID-19-Related Hospitalizations or 
      Deaths Among US Veterans During Omicron BA.1.
PG  - ofad605

AB  - BACKGROUND: The real-world clinical effectiveness of sotrovimab in preventing 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related hospitalization or mortality among 
      high-risk patients diagnosed with COVID-19, particularly after the emergence of 
      the Omicron variant, needs further research. METHOD: Using data from the US 
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system, we adopted a target trial 
      emulation design in our study. Veterans aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 
      between December 1, 2021, and April 4, 2022, were included. Patients treated with 
      sotrovimab (n = 2816) as part of routine clinical care were compared with all 
      eligible but untreated patients (n = 11,250). Cox proportional hazards modeling 
      estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between receipt 
      of sotrovimab and outcomes. RESULTS: Most (90%) sotrovimab recipients were ≥50 
      years old, and 64% had ≥2 mRNA vaccine doses or ≥1 dose of Ad26.COV2. During the 
      period that BA.1 was dominant, compared with patients not treated, 
      sotrovimab-treated patients had a 70% lower risk of hospitalization or mortality 
      within 30 days (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23-0.40). During BA.2 dominance, 
      sotrovimab-treated patients had a 71% (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-0.98) lower risk of 
      30-day COVID-19-related hospitalization, emergency room visits, or urgent care 
      visits (defined as severe COVID-19) compared with patients not treated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using national real-world data from high-risk and predominantly 
      vaccinated veterans, administration of sotrovimab, compared with contemporary 
      standard treatment regimens, was associated with reduced risk of 30-day 
      COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause mortality during the Omicron BA.1 
      period.

TI  - Adjusting for Selection Bias Due to Missing Eligibility Criteria in Emulated 
      Target Trials.
LID - kwae471 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae471 [doi]
AB  - Target trial emulation (TTE) is a popular framework for observational studies 
      based on electronic health records (EHR). A key component of this framework is 
      determining the patient population eligible for inclusion in both a target trial 
      of interest and its observational emulation. Missingness in variables that define 
      eligibility criteria, however, presents a major challenge towards determining the 
      eligible population when emulating a target trial with an observational study. In 
      practice, patients with incomplete data are almost always excluded from analysis 
      despite the possibility of selection bias, which can arise when subjects with 
      observed eligibility data are fundamentally different than excluded subjects. 
      Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, very little work has been done to 
      mitigate this concern. In this paper, we propose a novel conceptual framework to 
      address selection bias in TTE studies, tailored towards time-to-event endpoints, 
      and describe estimation and inferential procedures via inverse probability 
      weighting (IPW). Under an EHR-based simulation infrastructure, developed to 
      reflect the complexity of EHR data, we characterize common settings under which 
      missing eligibility data poses the threat of selection bias and investigate the 
      ability of the proposed methods to address it. Finally, using EHR databases from 
      Kaiser Permanente, we demonstrate the use of our method to evaluate the effect of 
      bariatric surgery on microvascular outcomes among a cohort of severely obese 
      patients with Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

PG  - 702502

AB  - Parkinson's disease covers a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from early 
      non-motor symptoms to the characteristic bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. 
      Although differences in the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease are 
      increasingly recognized, there is still a lack of insight into the heterogeneity 
      of the pre-diagnostic phase of Parkinson's disease. In this perspective, we 
      highlight three aspects regarding the role of population-based studies in 
      providing new insights into the heterogeneity of pre-diagnostic Parkinson's 
      disease. First we describe several specific advantages of population-based cohort 
      studies, including the design which overcomes some common biases, the broad data 
      collection and the high external validity. Second, we draw a parallel with the 
      field of Alzheimer's disease to provide future directions to uncover the 
      heterogeneity of pre-diagnostic Parkinson's disease. Finally, we anticipate on 
      the emergence of prevention and disease-modification trials and the potential 
      role of population-based studies herein. In the coming years, bridging gaps 
      between study designs will be essential to make vital advances in elucidating the 
      heterogeneity of pre-diagnostic Parkinson's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with cardiomyopathies are at risk for pregnancy complications. 
      The optimal mode of delivery in these patients is guided by expert opinion and 
      limited small studies. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to examine the 
      association of delivery mode with severe maternal morbidity events during 
      delivery hospitalization and readmissions among patients with cardiomyopathies. 
      METHODS: The Premier inpatient administrative database was used to conduct a 
      retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients with a diagnosis of a 
      cardiomyopathy. Utilizing a target trial emulation strategy, the primary analysis 
      compared outcomes among patients exposed to intended vaginal delivery vs intended 
      cesarean delivery (intention to treat). A secondary analysis compared outcomes 
      among patients who delivered vaginally vs by cesarean (as-treated). Outcomes 
      examined were nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity during the delivery 
      hospitalization, blood transfusion, and readmission. RESULTS: The cohort 
      consisted of 2,921 deliveries. In the primary analysis (intention to treat), 
      there was no difference in nontransfusion morbidity (adjusted OR [aOR]: 1.17; 
      95% CI: 0.91-1.51), blood transfusion (aOR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.81-1.98), or 
      readmission (aOR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.73-1.44) between intended vaginal delivery and 
      intended cesarean delivery. In the as-treated analysis, cesarean delivery was 
      associated with a 2-fold higher risk of nontransfusion morbidity (aOR: 2.44; 
      95% CI: 1.85-3.22) and blood transfusion (aOR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.34-3.81) when 
      compared with vaginal delivery. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cardiomyopathies, a 
      trial of labor does not confer a higher risk of maternal morbidity, blood 
      transfusion, or readmission compared with planned cesarean delivery.

TI  - Analytical Methods for Comparing Uncontrolled Trials With External Controls From 
      Real-World Data: A Systematic Literature Review and Comparison With European 
      Regulatory and Health Technology Assessment Practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide an overview of analytical methods in 
      scientific literature for comparing uncontrolled medicine trials with external 
      controls from individual patient data real-world data (IPD-RWD) and to compare 
      these methods with recommendations made in guidelines from European regulatory 
      and health technology assessment (HTA) organizations and with their evaluations 
      described in assessment reports. METHODS: A systematic literature review (until 
      March 1, 2023) in PubMed and Connected Papers was performed to identify 
      analytical methods for comparing uncontrolled trials with external controls from 
      IPD-RWD. These methods were compared descriptively with methods recommended in 
      method guidelines and encountered in assessment reports of the European Medicines 
      Agency (2015-2020) and 4 European HTA organizations (2015-2023). RESULTS: 
      Thirty-four identified scientific articles described analytical methods for 
      comparing uncontrolled trial data with IPD-RWD-based external controls. The 
      various methods covered controlling for confounding and/or dependent censoring, 
      correction for missing data, and analytical comparative modeling methods. Seven 
      guidelines also focused on research design, RWD quality, and transparency 
      aspects, and 4 of those recommended analytical methods for comparisons with 
      IPD-RWD. The methods discussed in regulatory (n = 15) and HTA (n = 35) assessment 
      reports were often based on aggregate data and lacked transparency owing to the 
      few details provided. CONCLUSIONS: Literature and guidelines suggest a 
      methodological approach to comparing uncontrolled trials with external controls 
      from IPD-RWD similar to target trial emulation, using state-of-the-art methods. 
      External controls supporting regulatory and HTA decision making were rarely in 
      line with this approach. Twelve recommendations are proposed to improve the 
      quality and acceptability of these methods.

TI  - The Need for a Practical Approach to Evaluate the Effectiveness of COVID-19 
      Vaccines for Low- and Middle-Income Countries.
PG  - 561-563
LID - tpmd210482 [pii]
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.21-0482 [doi]
AB  - The global demand for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently far 
      outweighs the available global supply and manufacturing capacity. As a result, 
      securing doses of vaccines for low- and middle-income countries has been 
      challenging, particularly for African countries. Clinical trial investigation for 
      COVID-19 vaccines has been rare in Africa, with the only randomized clinical 
      trials (RCTs) for COVID-19 vaccines having been conducted in South Africa. In 
      addition to addressing the current inequities in the vaccine roll-out for low- 
      and middle-income countries, there is a need to monitor the real-world 
      effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in these regions. Although RCTs are the 
      superior method for evaluating vaccine efficacy, the feasibility of conducting 
      RCTs to monitor COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness during mass vaccine campaigns will 
      likely be low. There is still a need to evaluate the effectiveness of mass 
      COVID-19 vaccine distribution in a practical manner. We discuss how target trial 
      emulation, the application of trial design principles from RCTs to the analysis 
      of observational data, can be used as a practical, cost-effective way to evaluate 
      real-world effectiveness for COVID-19 vaccines. There are several study design 
      considerations that need to be made in the analyses of observational data, such 
      as uncontrolled confounders and selection biases. Target trial emulation accounts 
      for these considerations to improve the analyses of observational data. The 
      framework of target trial emulation provides a practical way to monitor the 
      effectiveness of mass vaccine campaigns for COVID-19 using observational data.

TI  - Causal inference from observational data in neurosurgical studies: a mini-review 
      and tutorial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Establishing a causation relationship between treatments and patient 
      outcomes is of essential importance for researchers to guide clinical 
      decision-making with rigorous scientific evidence. Despite the fact that 
      randomized controlled trials are widely regarded as the gold standard for 
      identifying causal relationships, they are not without its generalizability and 
      ethical constraints. Observational studies employing causal inference methods 
      have emerged as a valuable alternative to exploring causal relationships. 
      METHODS: In this tutorial, we provide a succinct yet insightful guide about 
      identifying causal relationships using observational studies, with a specific 
      emphasis on research in the field of neurosurgery. RESULTS: We first emphasize 
      the importance of clearly defining causal questions and conceptualizing target 
      trial emulation. The limitations of the classic causation framework proposed by 
      Bradford Hill are then discussed. Following this, we introduce one of the modern 
      frameworks of causal inference, which centers around the potential outcome 
      framework and directed acyclic graphs. We present the obstacles presented by 
      confounding and selection bias when attempting to establish causal relationships 
      with observational data within this framework. CONCLUSION: To provide a 
      comprehensive overview, we present a summary of efficient causal inference 
      methods that can address these challenges, along with a simulation example to 
      illustrate these techniques.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In randomized trials, the intention-to-treat effect is the effect of 
      assignment to treatment strategies. The concept of assignment may not be clearly 
      defined when using observational data to emulate a target trial. AIMS: We aimed 
      to assess the practical implications of using data on prescription versus 
      dispensation as analogues of treatment assignment in observational analyses. 
      METHODS: We used the primary care-derived Swedish Primary Care Cardiovascular 
      Database of individuals with newly diagnosed hypertension between 2006 and 2014 
      and linked registers. We compared the effect of two antihypertensive drug classes 
      on the five-year risk of cancer and ischemic heart disease. Treatment assignment 
      was first mapped using prescription data, and then dispensation data. With unique 
      confounding structures, we sequentially adjusted for different classes of risk 
      factor due to uncertainty over the choice of relevant confounders for 
      prescription vs. dispensation. RESULTS: 7770 individuals were eligible when 
      assignment was defined using prescription compared with 5964 when defined using 
      dispensation. For both cancer and ischemic heart disease outcomes, both higher 
      and lower relative risks of the outcome were consistent with our data. Effect 
      estimates did not vary with the choice of prescription or dispensation data as 
      analogues of assignment, nor with sequential adjustment for class of risk factor. 
      CONCLUSION: The mapping of prescription or dispensation data to treatment 
      assignment influences the size and characteristics of the study population and 
      the structure of confounding. However, we found no clear numerical differences in 
      effect estimates in this study. Further investigation is required in other 
      settings.

TI  - Review of Recent Pharmacoepidemiologic Post-Market Safety Studies Through the 
      Lens of the Estimand Framework.
LID - 10.1007/s43441-025-00780-4 [doi]
AB  - The ICH E9(R1) estimand framework provides a systematic approach to ensure 
      alignment among clinical trial objectives, trial conduct, statistical analyses, 
      and interpretation of results, however, whether it can be readily utilized for 
      the pharmacoepidemiologic safety studies has not been established. We selected 
      articles on drug safety published in the Journal Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug 
      Safety (PDS), during 2020 to investigate whether estimand attributes were well 
      defined in the study design and reporting. We found that among twenty-five 
      articles selected, nineteen were cohort studies and six were nested case-control 
      studies. All studies had well-defined exposure, outcome, target population, and 
      population level summary. The term intercurrent event (ICE) was not mentioned in 
      any of the studies; however, many cohort studies discussed drug discontinuation, 
      treatment modification and terminal events, and strategies to handle them. All 
      studies used methods to control for confounding: propensity score methods or 
      covariate adjustment, or both for cohort studies; matching and covariate 
      adjustment for the nested case-control studies. We conclude that while the 
      estimand framework can serve to add clarity and precision to 
      pharmacoepidemiologic safety studies, more detailed considerations are required 
      for bias assessment to compensate for the lack of randomization and other 
      shortcomings in observational studies. Recent pharmacoepidemiology frameworks, 
      such as Target Trial Emulation, STaRT-RWE, HARPER could be combined with the 
      complementary principals from the estimand framework to help achieve the study 
      objectives.

AB  - Routinely-collected health data and emerging data-linkage capabilities provide 
      researchers and clinicians with rich opportunities to answer important research 
      questions by conducting observational studies. We provide stroke researchers with 
      10 important points to consider and implement to ensure the validity and 
      interpretability of descriptive epidemiology and causal inference studies based 
      on observational data. We discuss different types of observational studies and 
      biases that may arise in such studies. We review types of causal effects and the 
      use of Target Trial emulation and Directed Acyclic Graphs to improve validity of 
      observational studies. We also illustrate appropriate and inappropriate use of 
      covariate adjustment for the analyses of observational studies and review the 
      methods for estimating the effects of treatments, interventions, and exposures in 
      causal inference studies. Finally, we provide recommendations for clinical 
      researchers and journal manuscript reviewers in stroke domain and beyond for the 
      appropriate use and reporting of these methods.

AB  - Evidence is limited regarding the effect of prenatal benzodiazepine and 
      z-hypnotic exposure and long-term neurodevelopment in childhood. The objective of 
      this study was to investigate the effects of initiating benzodiazepine or 
      z-hypnotic treatment in early, mid, and late pregnancy on fifth-grade numeracy 
      and literacy scholastic skills in children by emulating 3 target trials. The 
      trials are identical except for the timing of enrollment and the number of 
      eligible individuals. Eligibility to the trials required a history of anxiety 
      and/or depression prior to pregnancy. We used data from the Norwegian Mother, 
      Father and Child Cohort Study, linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, to 
      emulate the trials. We adjusted for baseline covariates that were available at 
      time 0 for each trial by inverse probability of treatment weighting using the 
      propensity score. The findings of this study did not show any effect of mothers' 
      initiation of treatment with benzodiazepines or z-hypnotics in early, mid, or 
      late pregnancy on the children's fifth-grade test scores in numeracy and 
      literacy. The study results provide reassurance for patients in need of 
      benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics during pregnancy; however, these findings need to 
      be interpreted with caution due to low study power in some of the analyses. This 
      article is part of a Special Collection on Pharmacoepidemiology.

TI  - Avoiding Time-Related Biases: A Feasibility Study on Antidiabetic Drugs and 
      Pancreatic Cancer Applying the Parametric g-Formula to a Large German Healthcare 
      Database.
PG  - 1027-1038
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S328342 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Investigating intended or unintended effects of sustained drug use is of 
      high clinical relevance but remains methodologically challenging. This 
      feasibility study aims to evaluate the usefulness of the parametric g-formula 
      within a target trial for application to an extensive healthcare database in 
      order to address various sources of time-related biases and time-dependent 
      confounding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on the German Pharmacoepidemiological 
      Research Database (GePaRD), we estimated the pancreatic cancer incidence 
      comparing two hypothetical treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM), i.e., (A) sustained metformin monotherapy vs (B) combination therapy with 
      DPP-4 inhibitors after one year metformin monotherapy. We included 77,330 persons 
      with T2DM who started metformin therapy at baseline between 2005 and 2011. Key 
      aspects for avoiding time-related biases and time-dependent confounding were the 
      emulation of a target trial over a 7-year follow-up period and application of the 
      parametric g-formula. RESULTS: Over the 7-year follow-up period, 652 out of the 
      77,330 study subjects had a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Assuming no 
      unobserved confounding, we found evidence that the metformin/DPP-4i combination 
      therapy increased the risk of pancreatic cancer compared to a sustained metformin 
      monotherapy (risk ratio: 1.47; 95% bootstrap CI: 1.07-1.94). The risk ratio 
      decreased in sensitivity analyses addressing protopathic bias. CONCLUSION: While 
      protopathic bias could not fully be ruled out, and computational challenges 
      necessitated compromises in the analysis, the g-formula and target trial 
      emulation proved useful: Self-inflicted biases were avoided, observed 
      time-varying confounding was adjusted for, and the estimated risks have a clear 
      causal interpretation.

      prostate cancer, however up to 35% of patients will experience biochemical 
      recurrence, often treated with salvage radiotherapy. The objective of the study 
      was to investigate long-term effects of salvage radiotherapy. METHODS: A 
      prospective, controlled, non-randomized trial at 14 Swedish center's including 
      4,003 patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy 2008-2011. A target trial 
      emulation approach was used to identify eligible patients that was treated with 
      salvage radiotherapy. The control group received no salvage radiotherapy. 
      Outcomes were assessed by patient questionnaires on ordinal scales and 
      statistical group comparisons were made using ordered logit regression with 
      adjustment for baseline outcome and confounding factors. The primary endpoints 
      were bowel, urinary and sexual function and bothering due to dysfunction at 8 
      years. RESULTS: Eleven percent (330/3,139) of the analyzed study population 
      received salvage radiotherapy. Fecal leakage, leakage of mucus and hematochezia 
      were more common after receiving salvage radiotherapy compared with the control 
      group; 4.5% versus 2.6% odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): (1.90 [1.38; 
      2.62]), 6.8% versus 1.5% 4.14 (2.98; 5.76) and 8.6% versus 1.2% 4.14 (2.98; 
      5.76), respectively. Urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and hematuria 
      were more common after receiving salvage radiotherapy, 34% versus 23% 2.23 (2.65; 
      3.00), 65% versus 57% 1.65 (1.18; 2.29) and 16% versus 1.6% 11.17 (5.68; 21.99), 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Salvage radiotherapy was associated with increased risk 
      for fecal leakage, hematochezia, urinary incontinence and hematuria. Our results 
      emphasize the importance of selecting patients for salvage radiotherapy to avoid 
      overtreatment and to give high quality pre-treatment information to ensure 
      patients' preparedness for late side-effects.

TI  - Selection of Comparator Group in Observational Drug Safety Studies: Alternatives 
      to the Active Comparator New User Design.
PG  - 707-714
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001521 [doi]
AB  - A valid study design is essential when assessing the safety of drugs based on 
      observational data. The comparator group is a key element of the design and can 
      greatly influence the results. The active comparator new user design is a go-to 
      design in observational drug safety research where a target trial of initiation 
      of a study drug versus usual care is emulated. A comparison with another 
      treatment that targets similar patients as the study drug and has no effect on 
      the outcome has great potential to reduce bias. However, the active comparator 
      new user design can be difficult to implement because no suitable comparator drug 
      is available or because it requires extensive exclusion of study drug initiators. 
      In this analysis, we evaluated alternative study designs that can be used in drug 
      safety assessments when the active comparator new user design is not optimal. 
      Using target trial emulation as a common framework, we defined and evaluated the 
      following designs: traditional no use, no-use episodes, active comparator new 
      user, prevalent new user, generalized prevalent new user, and hierarchical 
      prevalent new user. We showed that all designs can be implemented by using 
      sequential cohorts and simply altering the patient selection criteria, i.e., 
      identifying increasingly restrictive cohorts. In this way, all designs are nested 
      in each other and the differences between them can be demonstrated clearly. We 
      concluded that many study-specific factors need to be considered when choosing a 
      design, including indication, available comparator drugs, treatment patterns, 
      potential effect modification, and sample size.

TI  - Effectiveness of Molnupiravir and Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir in CKD Patients With 
      COVID-19.
PG  - 1244-1253
LID - 10.1016/j.ekir.2024.02.009 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Even with effective vaccines, patients with CKD have a higher risk 
      of hospitalization and death subsequent to COVID-19 infection than those without 
      CKD. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir have been approved for emergency 
      use, but their effectiveness for the CKD population is still unknown. This study 
      was conducted to determine the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing mortality 
      and severe COVID-19 in the CKD population. METHODS: This was a target trial 
      emulation study using electronic health databases in Hong Kong. Patients with CKD 
      aged 18 years or older who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were included. The 
      per-protocol average treatment effect among COVID-19 oral antiviral initiators, 
      including all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 
      ventilatory support within 28 days, were compared to noninitiators. RESULTS: 
      Antivirals have been found to lower the risk of all-cause mortality, with 
      Molnupiravir at a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 
      to 0.95] and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir at an HR of 0.78 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.00]. 
      However, they do not significantly reduce the risk of ICU admission 
      (molnupiravir: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.30]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 0.86 
      [95% CI, 0.56 to 1.32]) or ventilatory support (molnupiravir: HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 
      0.76 to 1.33]; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.37]). There 
      was a greater risk reduction in males and those with higher Charlson Comorbidity 
      Index (CCI). The nirmatrelvir-ritonavir trial also showed reduced risk for those 
      who had antiviral treatment and received 3 or more vaccine doses. CONCLUSION: 
      Both molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced mortality rates for 
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CKD.

TI  - Emulating the EPIC trial using VetCompass primary-care data: causal effects of 
      pimobendan in UK dogs with grade IV/VI heart murmurs.
PG  - e0325695
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0325695 [doi]
LID - e0325695
AB  - Target trial emulation applies design principles from randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) to the analysis of observational data, potentially replicating RCT 
      results in real-world settings. The EPIC trial reported that pimobendan delays 
      the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF) and extends survival in dogs with 
      preclinical degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD). The current study aimed to 
      explore the extent to which target trial emulation approximates the EPIC trial 
      results in a primary-care setting. Grade IV/VI murmur diagnosis was defined as 
      the treatment intervention stage. There were 928 dogs ≥ 6 years and ≤ 15 kg at 
      first grade IV/VI murmur diagnosis recorded from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 
      2018 in the VetCompass database included in the study. A causal inference "target 
      trial emulation" approach using VetCompass anonymised clinical data was designed 
      to replicate the EPIC trial with adaptation for a primary-care setting and to 
      address immortal time bias, confounding bias and loss to follow-up. After bias 
      adjustments to establish causal effects using observational data, the 5-year CHF 
      cumulative incidence was lower in dogs prescribed pimobendan (34.1%, 95% CI 
      26.5-42.0) than dogs not prescribed pimobendan (56.3%, 95% CI 52.8-59.8). Dogs 
      prescribed pimobendan had 311 fewer days of health lost to CHF (95% CI 224-395 
      days) within 5 years. Dogs prescribed pimobendan lived longer (adjusted mean 
      survival time 1051 days, 95% CI 967-1125) than dogs not prescribed pimobendan 
      (905 days, 95% CI 871-940 days). This study demonstrates that target trial 
      emulation within veterinary research can replicate findings from RCTs. 
      Clinically, the current findings suggest that preclinical grade IV murmur 
      diagnosis may offer an appropriate intervention stage to begin pimobendan therapy 
      in dogs with presumed DMVD.

AB  - Deprescribing is defined as "the planned and supervised process of dose reduction 
      or stopping of medication that might be causing harm, or no longer be of 
      benefit". Barriers to deprescribing include healthcare professional fear and lack 
      of guidance. These may stem from limited available evidence on benefits and harms 
      of deprescribing medications commonly used among older persons. Advances in 
      pharmacoepidemiology and causal inference methods to evaluate comparative 
      effectiveness and safety of prescribing medications have yet to be considered for 
      deprescribing medication. This paper discusses select methods and how they can be 
      applied to deprescribing research, using case studies of benzodiazepines and 
      low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Target trial emulation involves the 
      explicit application of design principles from randomised controlled trials to 
      observational studies. Several design aspects, including defining eligibility 
      criteria and time zero, require additional considerations for deprescribing 
      studies. The active comparator new user design also presents challenges, 
      including selection of an appropriate comparator. This paper discusses these 
      aspects, and others, in relation to deprescribing studies. Furthermore, methods 
      proposed to control for confounding, in particular, the prior event rate ratio 
      and propensity scores, are discussed. Introduction of billing codes or mechanisms 
      for accurately determining when deprescribing has occurred would enhance the 
      ability to conduct research using routinely collected data. Although the 
      approaches discussed in this paper may strengthen observational studies of 
      deprescribing, their use may be best suited to certain scenarios or research 
      questions, where randomised controlled trials may be less feasible.

TI  - On the use of external controls in clinical trials.
PG  - 30-34
LID - 10.1093/jncimonographs/lgae046 [doi]
AB  - Externally controlled trials have commonly been used when conducting a randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) is not feasible or ethical. By allowing the study of new 
      treatments, use of external controls can lead to accelerated advances in the 
      management of rare diseases. The use of external controls, however, introduces 
      new challenges due to potential differences between the population the external 
      controls are enrolled from and the population the patients on the new trial are 
      enrolled from. Some differences include, but are not limited to, differences in 
      how patients are diagnosed and treated, differences in the case mix of the 
      underlying populations, differences in the ability to measure outcomes, and 
      differences in data collection. We discuss the potential benefits and challenges 
      of externally controlled trials, as well as strategies to mitigate bias, 
      including the estimand and target-trial emulation framework. We also provide a 
      brief overview of statistical methodology commonly used in these settings. We 
      note that although the strategies presented may help mitigate some of these 
      challenges, they cannot replace an RCT framework, and investigators should be 
      aware of the potential limitations of externally controlled trials.

TI  - Quality Measure Adherence and Oral Health Outcomes in Children.
PG  - e2353861
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.53861 [doi]
LID - e2353861
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Process-based quality measures are generally intended to promote 
      evidence-based practices that have been proven to improve outcomes. However, due 
      to lack of standardized implementation of diagnostic codes in dentistry, 
      assessing the association between process and oral health outcomes has been 
      challenging. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of adhering to dental quality 
      measures with patient oral health outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Using a target trial emulation, a causal inference framework, this retrospective 
      cohort study estimated the difference in the risk of developing tooth decay 
      between US children who adhered to process-based dental quality measures 
      (receiving topical fluoride and sealant [treated groups]) and those who did not 
      (control groups). Electronic health records of US children and adolescents aged 0 
      to 18 years from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020, were used. To emulate 
      random treatment assignment based on baseline confounders, coarsened exact 
      matching was used to produce covariate balance between the treated and control 
      groups. A time-to-event regression model produced effect estimates, adjusting for 
      time-varying covariates. Near-far matching was used to account for unmeasured 
      confounders as a sensitivity analysis. Data were analyzed from May 1 to August 7, 
      2023. EXPOSURES: Adherence to dental quality measures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Incidence of tooth decay. RESULTS: Among 69 212 US children aged 
      between 0 and 18 years (mean [SD] age, 10.2 [5.0] years; 49.5% male, 50.4% 
      female, and 0.1% unknown or transgender), 1930 (2.8%) were Asian, 2038 (2.9%) 
      were Black, 8667 (12.5%) were Hispanic, 33 632 (48.6%) were White, and 22 945 
      (33.2%) were multiracial, other, or missing racial and ethnic group 
      identification. Relative to control individuals, treated individuals were more 
      likely to be at elevated risk of caries (fluoride measure: 16 453 [76.5%] vs 15 
      236 [39.8%]; sealant measure: 2264 [54.6%] vs 997 [44.0%]) and have regular 
      dental visits (fluoride measure: 21 498 [100%] vs 13 741 [35.9%]; sealant 
      measure: 1623 [39.2%] vs 871 [38.4%]). Adherence to quality measures was 
      associated with reduced risk of tooth decay with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.82 
      (95% CI, 0.78- 0.86) for fluoride and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76-0.97) for sealant in the 
      matched cohort. Benefits of adhering to quality measures were greater among 
      children at elevated vs low risk and with public vs commercial insurance for both 
      measures. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort study, adhering to dental quality measures 
      was associated with reduced risk of tooth decay, and benefits were greater among 
      children at elevated risk and with public insurance. These findings provide 
      insights in facilitating targeted application of quality measures or developing 
      more tailored quality improvement initiatives.

TI  - Durability of immunity and clinical protection in nursing home residents 
      following bivalent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
LID - 2023.04.25.23289050 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.04.25.23289050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccines have substantially mitigated the disproportional impact of 
      SARS-CoV-2 on the high morbidity and mortality experienced by nursing home 
      residents. However, variation in vaccine efficacy, immune senescence and waning 
      immunity all undermine vaccine effectiveness over time. The introduction of the 
      bivalent vaccine in September 2022 aimed to counter this increasing 
      susceptibility and consequences of breakthrough infection, however data on the 
      durability and protection of the vaccine are limited. We evaluated the durability 
      of immunity and protection after the first bivalent vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 in 
      nursing home residents. METHODS: For the immunologic evaluation, community 
      nursing home volunteers agreed to serial blood sampling before, at two weeks, 
      three and six months after each vaccination for antibodies to spike protein and 
      pseudovirus neutralization activity over time. Concurrent clinical outcomes were 
      evaluated by reviewing electronic health record data from residents living in 
      Veterans Administration managed nursing home units. Residents without recent 
      infection but prior vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 were followed over time beginning 
      with administration of the newly available bivalent vaccine using a target trial 
      emulation (TTE) approach; TTE compared time to breakthrough infection, 
      hospitalization and death between those who did and did not receive the bivalent 
      vaccine. RESULTS: We evaluated antibodies in 650 nursing home residents; 452 had 
      data available following a first monovalent booster, 257 following a second 
      monovalent booster and 321 following a bivalent vaccine. We found a rise in BA.5 
      neutralization activity from the first and second monovalent boosters through the 
      bivalent vaccination regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 history. Titers declined at 
      three and six months after the bivalent vaccination but generally exceeded those 
      at three months compared to either prior boost. BA.5 neutralization titers six 
      months after the bivalent vaccination were diminished but had detectable levels 
      in 80% of infection-naive and 100% of prior infected individuals. TTE evaluated 
      5903 unique subjects, of whom 2235 received the bivalent boost. TTE demonstrated 
      39% or greater reduction in risk of infection, hospitalization or death at four 
      months following the bivalent boost. CONCLUSION: Immunologic results mirrored 
      those of the TTE and suggest bivalent vaccination added substantial protection 
      for up to six months after bivalent vaccination with notable exceptions. However, 
      the level of protection declined over this period, and by six months may open a 
      window of added vulnerability to infection before the next updated vaccine 
      becomes available. We strongly agree with the CDC recommendation that those who 
      have not received a bivalent vaccination receive that now and these results 
      support a second bivalent booster for those at greatest risk which includes many 
      nursing home residents.

TI  - JYNNEOS™ effectiveness as post-exposure prophylaxis against mpox: Challenges

AB  - BACKGROUND: JYNNEOS(TM) vaccine has been used as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 
      during a mpox outbreak in New York City (NYC). Data on effectiveness are limited. 
      METHODS: Effectiveness of a single dose of JYNNEOS(TM) vaccine administered 
      subcutaneously ≤ 14 days as PEP for preventing mpox disease was assessed among 
      individuals exposed to case-patients from May 22, 2022-August 24, 2022. 
      Individuals were evaluated for mpox through 21 days post-exposure. An 
      observational study was conducted emulating a sequence of nested "target" 
      randomized trials starting each day after exposure. Results were adjusted for 
      exposure risk and race/ethnicity. Analyses were conducted separately based on 
      last (PEP(L)) and first (PEP(F)) exposure date. We evaluated the potential to 
      overestimate PEP effectiveness when using conventional analytic methods due to 
      exposed individuals developing illness before they can obtain PEP (immortal time 
      bias) compared to the target trial. RESULTS: Median time from last exposure to 
      symptom onset (incubation period) among cases that did not receive PEP(L) was 
      7 days (range 1-16). Time to PEP(L) receipt was 7 days (range 0-14). Among 549 
      individuals, adjusted PEP(L) and PEP(F) effectiveness was 19 % (95 % Confidence 
      Interval [CI], -54 % to 57 %) and -7% (95 % CI, -144 % to 53 %) using the target 
      trial emulation, respectively, and 78 % (95 % CI, 50 % to 91 %) and 73 % (95 % 
      CI, 31 % to 91 %) using conventional analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Determining PEP 
      effectiveness using real-world data during an outbreak is challenging. Time to 
      PEP in NYC coupled with the observed incubation period resulted in overestimated 
      PEP effectiveness using a conventional method. The target trial emulation, while 
      yielding wide confidence intervals due to small sample size, avoided immortal 
      time bias. While results from these evaluations cannot be used as reliable 
      estimates of PEP effectiveness, we present important methodologic considerations 
      for future evaluations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between food needs and diabetes outcomes. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Longitudinal cohort study, using a target trial 
      emulation approach. 96,792 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent 
      food need assessment in a network of community-based health centers were followed 
      up to 36 months after initial assessment. We used targeted minimum loss 
      estimation to estimate the association between not experiencing food needs, 
      compared with experiencing food needs, and hemoglobin a1c (HbA1c), systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and LDL cholesterol. The study period was 
      June 24th, 2016 to April 30th, 2023. RESULTS: We estimated that not experiencing 
      food needs, compared with experiencing food needs, would be associated with 0.12 
      percentage points lower (95% Confidence Interval [CI] -0.16% to -0.09%, p 
      = < 0.0001) mean HbA1c at 12 months. We further estimated that not experiencing 
      food needs would be associated with a 12-month SBP that was 0.67 mm Hg lower 
      (95%CI -0.97 to -0.38 mm Hg, p < .0001), DBP 0.21 mm Hg lower (95%CI -0.38 to 
      -0.04 mm Hg, p = .01). There was no association with lower LDL cholesterol. 
      Results were similar at other timepoints, with associations for HbA1c, SBP, and 
      DBP of similar magnitude, and no difference in LDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      estimated that not experiencing food needs may be associated with modestly better 
      diabetes outcomes. These findings support testing interventions that address food 
      needs as part of their mechanism of action.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open colectomy in colon cancer 
      patients: a study protocol for emulating a target trial using cancer registry 
      data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to compare the 5 year overall 
      survival of patients with stage I-III colon cancer treated by laparoscopic 
      colectomy versus open colectomy. METHODS: Using Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 
      Cancer Registry data from 2008 to 2018, we will emulate a phase III, multicenter, 
      open-label, two-parallel-arm hypothetical target trial in adult patients with 
      stage I-III colon cancer who received laparoscopic or open colectomy as an 
      elective treatment. An inverse-probability weighted Royston‒Parmar parametric 
      survival model (RPpsm) will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of laparoscopic 
      versus open surgery after confounding factors are balanced between the two 
      treatment arms. Further to the hazard ratio, we will also compute differences in 
      the absolute risk (at 1, 3, and 5 years) and restricted mean survival time (up to 
      1, 3, and 5 years). A weighted Kaplan‒Meier curve will be used to compare 
      five-year overall survival in both treatment arms. Various comparator and 
      sensitivity analyses will be performed to check the robustness of the results 
      that will be estimated by the RPpsm main model. Treatment period- and 
      stage-specific results will also be provided. DISCUSSION: This study aims to 
      causally model the effect of laparoscopic versus open colectomy on 5 year overall 
      survival using a target trial emulation approach. As the cancer registry data do 
      not cover BMI, comorbidity, and previous abdominal surgery for non-malignant 
      indications, the potential for residual confounding arising from these factors is 
      a limitation of this study. This will be approached in a quantitative bias 
      analysis using the E-method. The results will substantiate existing evidence on 
      the comparative effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open colectomy in patients 
      with stage I-III colon cancer and may guide clinical decisions as to whether a 
      laparoscopic approach is as safe as an open approach in terms of improving 5-year 
      overall survival in these patient groups.

TI  - Association between lifestyle and metabolic syndrome incidence of workers in 
      northern Okinawa, Japan: A cohort study.
PG  - 101995
LID - 10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101995 [doi]
LID - 101995
AB  - In Japan, specific health checkups were implemented to prevent metabolic syndrome 
      (MetS) and cardiovascular diseases in April 2008. This study aimed to clarify the 
      relationship between lifestyle factors and the MetS incidence to understand how 
      the disease can be prevented and to improve the public health policy. A 
      retrospective cohort study was conducted using the specific health checkup data 
      of 2,781 workers. Lifestyle factors were assessed using lifestyle-related items 
      in the general health questionnaire included in the specific health checkups. The 
      hazard ratio values for the incidence of MetS according to lifestyle-related 
      items were determined from the data of the specific health checkup for 12 years. 
      The Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to evaluate hazard ratio 
      values after adjusting for confounding factors. The limitations of this research 
      method are discussed using a target trial emulation framework which investigates 
      problems such as biases in observational studies. The crude incidence rates per 
      1,000 person-years of MetS in women and men were 15.25 and 47.58, respectively. 
      Three dietary lifestyle-related factors, namely "Eating snacks and sweet 
      beverages other than breakfast, lunch, and dinner," "Eating faster than others," 
      and "Skipping breakfast at least three times a week," were identified, with the 
      hazard ratio values 1.262 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.032-1.542, p = 0.023), 
      1.220 (95 % CI 1.032-1.442, p = 0.020) and 1.189 (95 % CI 1.012-1.397, 
      p = 0.036), respectively. These results suggest that lifestyle improvements 
      related to extracted lifestyle-related items contribute to the prevention of 
      MetS.

TI  - Survival Benefit of First Single-Organ Deceased Donor Kidney Transplantation 
      Compared With Long-term Dialysis Across Ages in Transplant-Eligible Patients With 
      Kidney Failure.
PG  - e2234971
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.34971 [doi]
LID - e2234971
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Kidney transplant is considered beneficial in terms of survival 
      compared with continued dialysis for patients with kidney failure. However, 
      randomized clinical trials are infeasible, and available evidence from cohort 
      studies is at high risk of bias. OBJECTIVE: To compare restricted mean survival 
      times (RMSTs) between patients who underwent transplant and patients continuing 
      dialysis across transplant candidate ages and depending on waiting time, applying 
      target trial emulation methods. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 
      retrospective cohort study, patients aged 18 years or older appearing on the wait 
      list for their first single-organ deceased donor kidney transplant between 
      January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2018, in Austria were evaluated. Available data 
      were obtained from the Austrian Dialysis and Transplant Registry and 
      Eurotransplant and included repeated updates on wait-listing status and relevant 
      covariates. Data were analyzed between August 1, 2019, and December 23, 2021. 
      EXPOSURES: A target trial was emulated in which patients were randomized to 
      either receive the transplant immediately (treatment group) or to continue 
      dialysis and never receive a transplant (control group) at each time an organ 
      became available. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from 
      transplant allocation to death. Effect sizes in terms of RMSTs were obtained 
      using a sequential Cox approach. RESULTS: Among the 4445 included patients (2974 
      men [66.9%]; mean [SD] age, 52.2 [13.2] years), transplant was associated with 
      increased survival time across all considered ages compared with continuing 
      dialysis and remaining on the wait list within a 10-year follow-up. The estimated 
      RMST differences were 0.57 years (95% CI, -0.14 to 1.84 years) at age 20 years, 
      3.01 years (95% CI, 2.50 to 3.54 years) at age 60 years, and 2.48 years (95% CI, 
      1.88 to 3.04 years) at age 70 years. The survival benefit for patients who 
      underwent transplant across ages was independent of waiting time. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that kidney transplant prolongs the 
      survival time of persons with kidney failure across all candidate ages and 
      waiting times.

TI  - Surgeon Training and Revision Rates After Patellofemoral Arthroplasty.
PG  - e2517825
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.17825 [doi]
LID - e2517825
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Surgeon training with a specific implant is often not considered in 
      implant registry-based studies, which may lead to unobserved confounding bias. 
      Discrepancies between registry and clinical trial outcomes for patellofemoral 
      arthroplasty (PFA) may originate from differences in surgeon training levels. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare revision rates for knees operated on by knee surgeons 
      specifically trained for PFA and knee surgeons who were not. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: In this population-based cohort study, the framework of a target 
      trial was used to compare outcomes for 2 patient groups: patients who underwent 
      PFA performed by knee surgeons who had (trial surgeons) vs who had not (nontrial 
      surgeons) received focused PFA training as part of a randomized clinical trial. 
      All primary PFA procedures from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2015, were 
      identified using Danish registries and individual hospital notes with 6 years' 
      follow-up. Data were analyzed from January 24 to March 1, 2024. EXPOSURE: Focused 
      PFA training. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-year risk of 
      revision. Analyses were conducted according to a prespecified statistical 
      analysis plan, using multiple logistic regression to estimate marginal risk 
      ratios for 6-year risks of revision, reoperation, and mortality, adjusting for 
      potential confounders. RESULTS: Of 482 eligible knees of patients who had 
      undergone PFA, 274 (57%; 206 female [75%]; mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years) were 
      operated on by trial surgeons, and 208 (43%; 142 female [68%]; mean [SD] age, 57 
      [12] years) by nontrial surgeons. Trial surgeons operated on knees with higher 
      patellofemoral Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis grade (range 0-4, with 0 
      indicating no osteoarthritis and 4 indicating severe osteoarthritis) than 
      nontrial surgeons (79% vs 53% with grade 3 to 4) and higher tibiofemoral 
      Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis grades (37% vs 17% with grade 2 to 4). The 
      6-year revision rate for trial surgeons was 8% (22 of 274 knees) vs 26% (54 of 
      208 knees) for nontrial surgeons, corresponding to an adjusted relative risk (RR) 
      of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.22-0.56; P < .001). The reoperation rate was 12% (33 of 274 
      knees) for trial surgeons vs 19% (40 of 208 knees) for nontrial surgeons, with an 
      adjusted RR of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.42-1.18; P = .19). There was no difference in 
      mortality for trial vs nontribal surgeon groups (18 of 274 knees [7%] vs 12 of 
      208 knees [6%]; adjusted RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.53-2.33; P = .79). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this cohort study using a target trial emulation approach to assess 
      the association of surgeon training with PFA outcomes, the cumulative 6-year 
      revision rate for PFA was lower for knees operated on by PFA-trained knee 
      surgeons, suggesting that such surgeon training was associated with a better 
      outcome. This suggests that the level of training may be an important confounder 
      for registry-based comparisons of implant outcome, and that this confounder may 
      even obscure inherent implant outcomes.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor Therapy and Longitudinal Changes in 
      Kidney Function among Veterans with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 940-949
LID - 10.2215/CJN.0000000725 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use has not been 
      extensively studied in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In 
      veterans with ADPKD, kidney function declined at a greater rate during the first 
      3 months post-SGLT2i initiation but subsequently attenuated. In veterans with 
      ADPKD, SGLT2i versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor use was associated with 
      slower long-term kidney function decline. BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are a pillar of kidney disease therapy, but 
      their efficacy remains unknown in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
      (ADPKD). We evaluated effects of SGLT2i on kidney function in ADPKD. METHODS: 
      This retrospective cohort study within the Veterans Health Administration 
      included adults with an ADPKD diagnosis code who initiated SGLT2i between January 
      2017 and May 2023. Repeated measures models were used to evaluate eGFR slope 
      before and after SGLT2i initiation. Among patients with ADPKD and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus, a target trial emulation was used to compare the effects of SGLT2i 
      versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) on eGFR slope. RESULTS: Among 348 
      eligible patients with ADPKD who started an SGLT2i, 93% were male, mean±SD age 
      was 68±11, and median eGFR was 53 (interquartile range: 16–127) ml/min per 1.73 
      m(2). In adjusted analyses, the preinitiation eGFR slope was −0.79 (95% 
      confidence interval, −1.26 to −0.33) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per 90 days. The eGFR 
      slope steepened to −2.78 (−4.04 to −1.53) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) during the first 3 
      months postinitiation and then stabilized to −0.07 (−0.72 to 0.58) ml/min per 
      1.73 m(2) during months 3–12 postinitiation. The target trial emulation compared 
      217 SGLT2i users with 198 DPP4i users. In adjusted analyses, eGFR declined −4.03 
      (−6.45 to −1.60) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per 90 days faster in SGLT2i users versus 
      DPP4i users during the first 3 months postinitiation; however, during the 
      subsequent 3–12 months, the slope was more stable in SGLT2i initiators than DPP4i 
      initiators, with a difference of 1.29 (0.16 to 2.41) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per 90 
      days. CONCLUSIONS: In older patients with mild ADPKD and a high prevalence of 
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease who initiated an SGLT2i, there was an initial 
      3-month decline in eGFR followed by stabilization during the remainder of the 
      year-long follow-up. Compared with DPP4i use, SGLT2i use was associated with a 
      slower eGFR decline between 3 and 12 months postinitiation in patients with 
      concurrent type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings suggest that SGLT2is are 
      potentially beneficial in older individuals with ADPKD in whom comorbid disease 
      may play a greater role in kidney function decline, but further studies are 
      required.

TI  - Effects of azithromycin in young adults with cystic fibrosis: a protocol for 
      emulating a published randomised controlled trial using registry data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Target trial emulation is a framework for evaluating the effects of 
      treatments using observational data. The trial emulation approach involves 
      specifying key elements of a protocol for a target trial (a randomised controlled 
      trial designed to address the question of interest) and then describing how best 
      to emulate the trial using observational data. Recent years have seen an uptake 
      of target trial emulation in several disease areas, although there are limited 
      examples in cystic fibrosis (CF). This protocol describes a study which aims to 
      assess the applicability of target trial emulation in CF. We aim to emulate an 
      existing trial in CF and assess to what extent the results from the trial can be 
      replicated using registry data. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The target trial is a 
      published randomised controlled trial which found evidence for beneficial effects 
      of azithromycin use on lung function in young adults with CF. Two emulated trials 
      are planned: one using data from the UK CF Registry and one using data from the 
      US CF Registry. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment and outcome 
      definitions, follow-up period, and estimand of interest are all designed to match 
      the published trial as closely as possible. The analysis step of the trial 
      emulations will use causal inference methods to control for confounding. Results 
      obtained in the emulated trials using registry data will be compared with those 
      from the target trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been 
      granted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee 
      (Ref: 29609). This study has also been approved by the UK CF Registry Research 
      Committee and the North Star Review Board. The results of this study will be 
      published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant scientific 
      conferences.

TI  - Risk of heart failure in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation and diabetes 
      taking different oral anticoagulants: a nationwide cohort study.
PG  - 1
LID - 10.1186/s12933-022-01688-1 [doi]
LID - 1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a critical complication in elderly patients 
      with atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Recent preclinical 
      studies suggested that non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) can 
      potentially suppress the progression of cardiac fibrosis and ischemic 
      cardiomyopathy. Whether different oral anticoagulants influence the risk of HF in 
      older adults with AF and DM is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of 
      HF in elderly patients with AF and DM who were administered NOACs or warfarin. 
      METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted based on claims 
      data from the entire Taiwanese population. Target trial emulation design was 
      applied to strengthen causal inference using observational data. Patients aged 
       ≥ 65 years with AF and DM on NOAC or warfarin treatment between 2012 and 2019 
      were included and followed up until 2020. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed 
      HF. Propensity score-based fine stratification weightings were used to balance 
      patient characteristics between NOAC and warfarin groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) 
      were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The study included 
      a total of 24,835 individuals (19,710 NOAC and 5,125 warfarin users). Patients 
      taking NOACs had a significantly lower risk of HF than those taking warfarin 
      (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses for individual NOACs 
      suggested that dabigatran (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.93, p < 0.001), rivaroxaban 
      (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86, p < 0.001), apixaban (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.90, 
      p < 0.001), and edoxaban (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.86, p < 0.001) were associated 
      with lower risks of HF than warfarin. The findings were consistent regardless of 
      age and sex subgroups and were more prominent in those with high medication 
      possession ratios. Several sensitivity analyses further supported the robustness 
      of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide cohort study demonstrated that 
      elderly patients with AF and DM taking NOACs had a lower risk of incident HF than 
      those taking warfarin. Our findings suggested that NOACs may be the preferred 
      oral anticoagulant treatment when considering the prevention of heart failure in 
      this vulnerable population. Future research is warranted to elucidate causation 
      and investigate the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Evidence-based medicine is central to reproductive health care, guiding 
      interventions such as ovarian stimulation protocols and fertility preservation 
      strategies. While randomized controlled trials (RCT) remain the gold standard for 
      providing evidence and for establishing causality, their limitations, including 
      restricted generalizability and high costs, highlight the need for complementary 
      methodologies. Real-world evidence (RWE), derived from real-world data (RWD) such 
      as electronic health records and assisted reproductive technology (ART) 
      registries, has the potential to bridge the gap between controlled research 
      settings and routine clinical practice, particularly for evaluating long-term and 
      rare outcomes. However, RWE faces considerable challenges, including bias, 
      variability in data quality, and difficulties in establishing causality. This 
      paper explores the role of RWE in ART. Despite its promise, RWE cannot replace 
      RCT, particularly in scenarios where the signal-to-noise ratio is low, such as 
      detecting small effect differences in ovarian stimulation protocols or treatment 
      add-ons. Instead, in most instances, RWE is positioned to complement RCT, 
      supported by emerging regulatory frameworks such as the guidelines of the 
      European Medicine Agency and the European Union's tissue directives, which 
      emphasize the generation of RWE from ART practice to strengthen patient follow-up 
      and safety monitoring. For ART stakeholders, a comprehensive understanding of the 
      strengths and limitations of RWE is essential, as is the target trial emulation 
      framework on RWD, for advancing the field and improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Donor HLA Class I Evolutionary Divergence and Late Allograft Rejection After 
      Liver Transplantation in Children: An Emulated Target Trial.
PG  - e70320
LID - 10.1111/tan.70320 [doi]
AB  - HLA evolutionary divergence (HED), a continuous metric quantifying the 
      differences between each amino acid of two homologous HLA alleles, reflects the 
      importance of the immunopeptidome presented to T lymphocytes. It has been 
      associated with rejection after liver transplantation. This retrospective cohort 
      study aimed to analyse the potential effect of donor or recipient HED on liver 
      transplant rejection in a new series of patients transplanted during childhood 
      and followed in adulthood. The study included 120 children who had been 
      transplanted between 1991 and 2010 and were followed by routine biopsies and 
      histological evaluations with a median of 14.1 years post-LT. Liver biopsies were 
      performed routinely 1, 5, 10 and 20 years after transplantation and in the event 
      of liver dysfunction. HED was calculated using the physicochemical Grantham 
      distance for donor and recipient Class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and Class II (HLA-DRB1, 
      -DQB1) alleles. The influence of HED on rejection was analysed using inverse 
      probability weighting (IPW) and target trial emulation using the g method. Based 
      on the IPW score, donor HED class I was correlated with the occurrence of late 
      (> 90 days) rejection (HR, 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01-1.40) independently of HLA 
      mismatches, donor age and initial induction. The emulated target trial confirmed 
      that donor HED Class I has a causal effect on liver graft rejection and this 
      relationship was observed long-term.

TI  - Estimating the effect of donor sex on red blood cell transfused patient 
      mortality: A retrospective cohort study using a targeted learning and emulated 
      trials-based approach.
PG  - 101628

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies determining the effect of red blood cell (RBC) 
      donor sex on recipient mortality have been inconsistent. Emulating hypothetical 
      randomized target trials using large real-world data and targeted learning may 
      clarify potential adverse effects. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a 
      RBC transfusion database from the Capital Region of Denmark comprising more than 
      900,000 transfusion events defined the observational data. Eligible patients were 
      minimum 18 years, had received a leukocyte-reduced RBC transfusion, and had no 
      history of RBC transfusions within the past year at baseline. The doubly robust 
      targeted maximum likelihood estimation method coupled with ensembled machine 
      learning was used to emulate sex-stratified target trials determining the 
      comparative effectiveness of exclusively transfusing RBC units from either male 
      or female donors. The outcome was all-cause mortality within 28 days of the 
      baseline-transfusion. Estimates were adjusted for the total number of 
      transfusions received on each day k, hospital of transfusion, calendar period, 
      patient age and sex, ABO/RhD blood group of the patient, Charlson comorbidity 
      score, the total number of transfusions received prior to day k, and the number 
      of RBC units received on each day k from donors younger than 40 years of age. 
      FINDINGS: Among 98,167 adult patients who were transfused between Jan. 1, 2008, 
      and Apr. 10, 2018, a total of 90,917 patients (54.6% female) were eligible. For 
      male patients, the 28-day survival was 2.06 percentage points (pp) (95 % 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.81-2.32, P<0.0001) higher under treatment with RBC 
      units exclusively from male donors compared with exclusively from female donors. 
      In female patients, exclusively transfusing RBC units from either male or female 
      donors increased the 28-day survival with 0.64pp (0.52-0.76, P<0.0001), and 
      0.62pp (0.49-0.75, P<0.0001) compared with the current practice, respectively. No 
      evidence of a sex-specific donor effect was found for female patients (0.02pp 
      [-0.18-0.22]). The sensitivity analyses showed that a large unknown causal bias 
      would have to be present to affect the conclusions. INTERPRETATION: The results 
      suggest that a sex-matched transfusion policy may benefit patients. However, a 
      causal interpretation of the findings relies on the assumption of no unmeasured 
      confounding, treatment consistency, positivity, and minimal model 
      misspecifications. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Innovation Fund

TI  - Can Observational Analyses of Routinely Collected Data Emulate Randomized Trials? 
      Design and Feasibility of the Observational Patient Evidence for Regulatory 
      Approval Science and Understanding Disease Project.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Observational Patient Evidence for Regulatory Approval Science 
      and Understanding Disease (OPERAND) project examines whether real-world data 
      (RWD) can be used to inform regulatory decision making. METHODS: OPERAND 
      evaluates whether observational analyses using RWD to emulate index trials can 
      produce effect estimates similar to those of the trials and examines the impact 
      of relaxing the eligibility criteria of the observational analyses to obtain 
      samples that more closely match the real-world populations receiving the 
      treatments. In OPERAND, 2 research teams independently attempt to emulate the 
      ROCKET Atrial Fibrillation and LEAD-2 trials using OptumLabs data. This article 
      describes the design of the project, summarizes the approaches of the 2 research 
      teams, and presents feasibility results for 2 emulations using new-user designs. 
      RESULTS: There were differences in the teams' conceptualizations of the 
      emulation, design decisions for cohort identification, and resulting RWD cohorts. 
      These differences occurred even though both teams were guided by the same index 
      trials and had access to the same source of RWD. CONCLUSIONS: Reasonable 
      alternative design and analysis approaches may be taken to answer the same 
      research question, even when attempting to emulate the same index trial. 
      Researcher decision making is an understudied and potentially important source of 
      variability across RWD analyses.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a network meta-analytic model for the evaluation 
      of treatment effectiveness within predictive biomarker subgroups, by combining 
      evidence from individual participant data (IPD) from digital sources (in the 
      absence of randomized controlled trials) and aggregate data (AD). STUDY DESIGN 
      AND SETTING: A Bayesian framework was developed for modeling time-to-event data 
      to evaluate predictive biomarkers. IPD were sourced from electronic health 
      records, using a target trial emulation approach, or digitized Kaplan-Meier 
      curves. The model is illustrated using two examples: breast cancer with a hormone 
      receptor biomarker, and metastatic colorectal cancer with the Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 
      (KRAS) biomarker. RESULTS: The model allowed for the estimation of treatment 
      effects in two subgroups of patients defined by their biomarker status. 
      Effectiveness of taxanes did not differ in hormone receptor positive and negative 
      breast cancer patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors were more 
      effective than chemotherapy in KRAS wild type colorectal cancer patients but not 
      in patients with KRAS mutant status. Use of IPD reduced uncertainty of the 
      subgroup-specific treatment effect estimates by up to 49%. CONCLUSION: 
      Utilization of IPD allowed for more detailed evaluation of predictive biomarkers 
      and cancer therapies and improved precision of the estimates compared to use of 
      AD alone.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics of comparative non-randomised studies 
      that assess the effectiveness or safety, or both, of drug treatments. DESIGN: 
      Cross sectional study. DATA SOURCES: Medline (Ovid), for reports published from 1 
      June 2022 to 31 August 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Reports 
      of comparative non-randomised studies that assessed the effectiveness or safety, 
      or both, of drug treatments were included. A randomly ordered sample was screened 
      until 200 eligible reports were found. Data on general characteristics, reporting 
      characteristics, and time point alignment were extracted, and possible related 
      biases, with a piloted form inspired by reporting guidelines and the target trial 
      emulation framework. RESULTS: Of 462 reports of non-randomised studies 
      identified, 262 studies were excluded (32% had no comparator and 25% did not 
      account for confounding factors). To assess time point alignment and possible 
      related biases, three study time points were considered: eligibility, treatment 
      assignment, and start of follow-up. Of the 200 included reports, 70% had one 
      possible bias, related to: inclusion of prevalent users in 24%, post-treatment 
      eligibility criteria in 32%, immortal time periods in 42%, and classification of 
      treatment in 23%. Reporting was incomplete, and only 2% reported all six of the 
      key elements considered: eligibility criteria (87%), description of treatment 
      (46%), deviations in treatment (27%), causal contrast (11%), primary outcomes 
      (90%), and confounding factors (88%). Most studies used routinely collected data 
      (67%), but only 7% reported using validation studies of the codes or algorithms 
      applied to select the population. Only 7% of reports mentioned registration on a 
      trial registry and 3% had an available protocol. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the 
      study suggest that although access to real world evidence could be valuable, the 
      robustness and transparency of non-randomised studies need to be improved.

TI  - Surgery or radiotherapy for early-stage cancer study (SORT) target trial 
      protocol: stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with curative intent versus 
      surgical resection for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
PG  - e103038
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2025-103038 [doi]
LID - e103038
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Randomised controlled trials have aimed to assess the effectiveness 
      of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with curative intent versus surgical 
      resection for individuals diagnosed with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC) but have failed to recruit sufficient numbers of patients. Non-randomised 
      studies for early-stage NSCLC have reported mixed outcomes following curative 
      SABR versus surgical resection, but did not fully address confounding by 
      indication. The Surgery Or RadioTherapy for early-stage cancer study (SORT) will 
      assess the comparative effectiveness of SABR with curative intent versus surgical 
      resection for NSCLC with a target trial emulation approach, as this can reduce 
      biases in observational studies that aim to estimate the causal effect of 
      interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The SORT study will use the National Cancer 
      Registry for individuals diagnosed with early-stage NSCLC in England during 
      2015-2020 (inclusive) who received SABR with curative intent or surgical 
      resection. These data will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, National 
      Radiotherapy Data Set and the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy dataset to obtain 
      information on clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and the treatment 
      received. This target trial emulation will define study population eligibility 
      criteria and regimens for SABR with curative intent and surgical resection. We 
      will reduce the risk of residual confounding with instrumental variable analyses 
      that will exploit geographical variation across the National Health Service in 
      England in the use of SABR with curative intent versus surgical resection for 
      early-stage NSCLC. The primary outcome will be 3-year all-cause mortality after 
      treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes will include 3-month, 6-month, 12-month 
      and 24-month all-cause and lung-cancer mortality, time to death, numbers of 
      hospitalisations, incremental costs and incremental cost-effectiveness. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the London School of 
      Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee (reference number 
      29 717-1). Results will be disseminated to clinicians, patients, policy-makers 
      and researchers.

TI  - Going beyond randomised controlled trials to assess treatment effect 
      heterogeneity across target populations.
PG  - 85-104
LID - 10.1002/hec.4903 [doi]
AB  - Methods have been developed for transporting evidence from randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) to target populations. However, these approaches allow only for 
      differences in characteristics observed in the RCT and real-world data (overt 
      heterogeneity). These approaches do not recognise heterogeneity of treatment 
      effects (HTE) according to unmeasured characteristics (essential heterogeneity). 
      We use a target trial design and apply a local instrumental variable (LIV) 
      approach to electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research 
      Datalink, and examine both forms of heterogeneity in assessing the comparative 
      effectiveness of two second-line treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We 
      first estimate individualised estimates of HTE across the entire target 
      population defined by applying eligibility criteria from national guidelines 
      (n = 13,240) within an overall target trial framework. We define a subpopulation 
      who meet a published RCT's eligibility criteria ('RCT-eligible', n = 6497), and a 
      subpopulation who do not ('RCT-ineligible', n = 6743). We compare average 
      treatment effects for pre-specified subgroups within the RCT-eligible 
      subpopulation, the RCT-ineligible subpopulation, and within the overall target 
      population. We find differences across these subpopulations in the magnitude of 
      subgroup-level treatment effects, but that the direction of estimated effects is 
      stable. Our results highlight that LIV methods can provide useful evidence about 
      treatment effect heterogeneity including for those subpopulations excluded from 
      RCTs.

TI  - Virtual Collaborative Care Versus Specialty Psychiatry Treatment for Depression 
      or Anxiety.
LID - 24m15332 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.24m15332 [doi]
AB  - Objective: While collaborative care is known to improve depressive and anxiety 
      symptoms in primary care, comparative effectiveness studies of virtual 
      collaborative care versus virtual specialty psychiatry treatment in real world 
      settings are lacking. This study examined patient depressive and anxiety symptoms 
      over 6 months in collaborative care versus specialty psychiatry. Methods: This 
      was an observational study with target trial emulation in a large, 
      community-based, integrated health care system. Participants were ≥18 years old 
      with mild-moderate depressive or anxiety symptoms measured by the Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-9 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale. Exclusion criteria 
      included acute suicide risk. Patients were assigned to collaborative care or 
      specialty psychiatry, and symptoms were measured 6 months after treatment 
      initiation using linear mixed-effects regression with inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting. Results: There were N = 10,380 patients (n = 1,607 in 
      collaborative care; n = 8,773 in specialty psychiatry) with depressive disorders 
      and N = 2,935 (n = 570 in collaborative care; n = 2,365 in specialty psychiatry) 
      with anxiety disorders. Model effects at 6 months showed significant symptom 
      improvement for patients in collaborative care (adjusted mean difference [AMD] = 
      -9.0, 95% CI, -9.7, -8.4 for depression; -5.4, 95% CI, -6.2, -4.7 for anxiety) 
      and in specialty psychiatry (AMD = -5.0, 95% CI, -5.6, -4.5 for depression; -2.8, 
      95% CI, -3.6, -2.1 for anxiety), with patients in collaborative care showing 
      significantly greater improvement compared to those in specialty psychiatry (AMD 
      = -4.0, 95% CI, -4.7, -3.3, P < .0001 for depression; AMD = -2.6, 95% CI, -3.4, 
      -1.8, P < .0001 for anxiety). Conclusions: Virtual collaborative care was at 
      least as effective as specialty psychiatry for depression and anxiety. 
      Collaborative care implementation can support national guidelines regarding 
      depression and anxiety screening and treatment.

TI  - Vaccination, regular exercise, and prevention of chronic lung disease reduce 
      exacerbation of COVID-19 severity in northern Okinawa, Japan: A cross-sectional 
      study.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1265/ehpm.23-00281 [doi]
LID - 73
AB  - BACKGROUND: As at June 14, 2023, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
      had affected more than 767 million people and caused more than 6.9 million deaths 
      worldwide. This study aimed to clarify the lifestyle factors that influence the 
      exacerbation of COVID-19 severity. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 
      patients with COVID-19 whose severity classification of "moderate or severe" 
      (COVID-19 exacerbation) was defined as an objective variable. The 1,353 
      participants were selected from 4,899 patients with COVID-19 between August 10, 
      2020 and December 10, 2022. Participants who underwent a specific health checkup 
      before the date for a COVID-19 consultation were included. Using binominal 
      logistic regression analysis, we evaluated the odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 
      exacerbation according to lifestyle-related factors. Limitations were discussed 
      using a target trial emulation framework which clarifies problems in 
      observational studies. RESULTS: The explanatory variables extracted as factors 
      that exacerbated COVID-19 severity were gender (OR [man vs. woman]: 2.533, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.484-4.322); age (OR [50s vs. 10s, 20s, or 30s]: 4.858, 
      95% CI 2.319-10.177; OR [60s]: 9.738, 95% CI 4.355-21.777; OR [70s + 80s + 90s]: 
      8.327, 95% CI 3.224-21.507); and comorbid chronic lung disease (OR ['yes' vs. 
      'no']: 2.892, 95% CI 1.227-6.818). The explanatory variables extracted as factors 
      that reduce the severity of COVID-19 were hospital consultation year (OR [2022,

TI  - Assessing the safety and efficacy of prescribing psychologists in New Mexico and 
      Louisiana.
LID - 10.1037/amp0001373 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to compare patient outcomes between prescribing psychologists, 
      psychiatrists, and primary care physicians (PCPs). Private insurance claims 
      (2005-2021; n = 307,478) were used to conduct an active comparator, new user 
      longitudinal cohort study developed using target trial emulation. Inverse 
      propensity for treatment weighting was used to adjust for baseline differences in 
      a range of sociodemographic, clinical, and contextual patient factors. 
      Differences in the 1-year rate of health care visits for adverse drug events 
      (ADEs), psychiatric emergency department (ED) utilization, medication adherence, 
      and psychotropic polypharmacy were identified between prescribing psychologists 
      and the other provider types using doubly robust Cox proportional hazards models. 
      Compared to patients of psychiatrists, patients of prescribing psychologists had 
      a 24% lower rate of ADEs (95% CI [0.60, 0.96]), a 20% lower rate of psychotropic 
      polypharmacy (95% CI [0.74, 0.86]), and similar rates of psychiatric ED 
      utilization and medication nonadherence. Compared to patients of PCPs, patients 
      of prescribing psychologists had 138% higher rates of psychiatric ED utilization 
      (95% CI [1.67, 3.39]), 175% higher rates of psychotropic polypharmacy (95% CI 
      [2.53, 2.99]), 28% lower rates of medication nonadherence (95% CI [0.66, 0.78]), 
      and similar rates of ADEs. Using robust pharmacoepidemiological methods, we noted 
      that among mental health specialists, prescribing psychologists appear to be as 
      safe and efficacious as psychiatrists in a large sample of privately insured 
      patients. Notable differences in safety and efficacy when compared to PCPs may be 
      attributable to differences between specialty and primary care. Future research 
      on prescribing psychologists should move toward studies of care quality.

TI  - HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and COVID-19 mortality in Stockholm, Sweden: A 
      registry-based cohort study.
PG  - e1003820
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003820 [doi]
LID - e1003820
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between statin treatment and Coronavirus Disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) mortality has been discussed due to the pleiotropic effects of 
      statins on coagulation and immune mechanisms. However, available observational 
      studies are hampered by study design flaws, resulting in substantial 
      heterogeneity and ambiguities. Here, we aim to determine the relationship between 
      statin treatment and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This cohort study 
      included all Stockholm residents aged 45 or older (N = 963,876), followed up from 
      1 March 2020 until 11 November 2020. The exposure was statin treatment initiated 
      before the COVID-19-pandemic, defined as recorded statin dispensation in the 
      Swedish Prescribed Drug Register between 1 March 2019 and 29 February 2020. 
      COVID-19-specific mortality was ascertained from the Swedish Cause of Death 
      Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using multivariable Cox regression 
      models. We further performed a target trial emulation restricted to initiators of 
      statins. In the cohort (51.6% female), 169,642 individuals (17.6%) were statin 
      users. Statin users were older (71.0 versus 58.0 years), more likely to be male 
      (53.3% versus 46.7%), more often diagnosed with comorbidities (for example, 
      ischemic heart disease 23.3% versus 1.6%), more frequently on anticoagulant and 
      antihypertensive treatments, less likely to have a university-level education 
      (34.5% versus 45.4%), and more likely to have a low disposable income (20.6% 
      versus 25.2%), but less likely to reside in crowded housing (6.1% versus 10.3%). 
      A total of 2,545 individuals died from COVID-19 during follow-up, including 765 
      (0.5%) of the statin users and 1,780 (0.2%) of the nonusers. Statin treatment was 
      associated with a lowered COVID-19 mortality (adjusted HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 
      0.97, P = 0.01), and this association did not vary appreciably across age groups, 
      sexes, or COVID-19 risk groups. The confounder adjusted HR for statin treatment 
      initiators was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.59 to 1.05, P = 0.10) in the emulated target 
      trial. Limitations of this study include the observational design, reliance on 
      dispensation data, and the inability to study specific drug regimens. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment had a modest negative association with COVID-19 
      mortality. While this finding needs confirmation from randomized clinical trials, 
      it supports the continued use of statin treatment for medical prevention 
      according to current recommendations also during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      mRNA vaccine recipients in Georgia, USA, from December 2020 to March 2022. We 
      compared three protocols defined by interdose interval: recommended by the Food 
      and Drug Administration (FDA) (17-25 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; 24-32 days for 
      Moderna), late-but-allowable (26-42 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; 33-49 days for 
      Moderna), and late ( ≥ 43 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; ≥50 days for Moderna). In the 
      short-term, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lowest under the FDA-recommended 
      protocol. Longer-term, the late-but-allowable protocol resulted in the lowest 
      risk (risk ratio on Day 120 after the first dose administration compared to the 
      FDA-recommended protocol: 0.83 [95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.84]). Here, we 
      showed that delaying the second dose by 1-2 weeks may provide stronger long-term 
      protection.

TI  - Educational Outcomes for Children at 7 to 9 Years of Age After Birth at 39 vs 40 
      to 42 Weeks' Gestation.
PG  - e2343721
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.43721 [doi]
LID - e2343721
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Birth at 39 weeks' gestation is common and thought to be safe for 
      mother and neonate. However, findings of long-term outcomes for children born at 
      this gestational age have been conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      association of birth at 39 weeks' gestation with childhood numeracy and literacy 
      scores at ages 7 to 9 years compared with birth at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this Australian statewide, population-based 
      cohort study using a causal inference framework based on target trial emulation, 
      perinatal data on births between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2011, were 
      linked to educational outcomes at 7 to 9 years of age. Statistical analyses were 
      performed from December 2022 to June 2023. EXPOSURE: Birth at 39 weeks' gestation 
      compared with birth at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Numeracy and literacy outcomes were assessed at 7 to 9 years of age using 
      Australian National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy data and defined by 
      overall z score across 5 domains (grammar and punctuation, reading, writing, 
      spelling, and numeracy). Multiple imputation and doubly robust inverse 
      probability weighted regression adjustment were used to estimate population 
      average causal effects. RESULTS: The study population included 155 575 children. 
      Of these children, 49 456 (31.8%; 24 952 boys [50.5%]) were born at 39 weeks' 
      gestation and were compared with 106 119 (68.2%; 52 083 boys [49.1%]) born at 40 
      to 42 weeks' gestation. Birth at 39 weeks' gestation was not associated with 
      altered educational outcomes for children aged 7 to 9 years compared with their 
      peers born at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation (mean [SE] z score, 0.0008 [0.0019] vs 
      -0.0031 [0.0038]; adjusted risk difference, -0.004 [95% CI, -0.015 to 0.007]). 
      Each educational domain was investigated, and no significant difference was found 
      in grammar and punctuation (risk difference [RD], -0.006 [95% CI, -0.016 to 
      0.005]), numeracy (RD, -0.009 [95% CI, -0.020 to 0.001]), spelling (RD, 0.001 
      [95% CI, -0.011 to 0.0013]), reading (RD, -0.008 [95% CI, -0.019 to 0.003]), or 
      writing (RD, 0.006 [95% CI, -0.005 to 0.016]) scores for children born at 39 
      weeks' gestation compared with those born at 40 to 42 weeks' gestation. Birth at 
      39 weeks' gestation also did not increase the risk of scoring below national 
      minimum standards in any of the 5 tested domains. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Using data from a statewide linkage study to emulate the results of a target 
      randomized clinical trial, this study suggests that there is no evidence of an 
      association of birth at 39 weeks' gestation with numeracy and literacy outcomes 
      for children aged 7 to 9 years.

TI  - Reparations for African Enslavement in the U.S. and Black Survival Using the 
      Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
LID - kwae444 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae444 [doi]
AB  - Activists, policymakers, and scholars increasingly have advocated for reparations 
      payments to Black Americans to redress the harms of enslavement and 
      discriminatory practices that followed. This study examined the effects of a 
      hypothetical monetary reparations intervention on all-cause premature and overall 
      mortality among Black adults in the U.S. We used the Black-white wealth gap to 
      calculate monetary costs, modeling the effects of wealth influxes of $905,426.10 
      (in 2019 USD) to each Black household (the amount necessary to eliminate the mean 
      Black-white wealth gap), distributed over 10 years. We applied a target trial 
      emulation framework to data in the Panel Study on Income Dynamics (n=16,010). 
      Each Black household head or spouse/partner was followed from baseline until 
      death, incomplete follow-up, 18 years after baseline, or the end of follow-up in 
      2019, whichever occurred first. Using the g-formula to account for time-fixed and 
      time-varying confounders, we found a 29% reduction in premature mortality and a 
      25.6% reduction in overall mortality among Black adults under the reparations 
      intervention. Our findings provide evidence that reparations are a lifesaving and 
      justice-promoting social policy that could significantly contribute to efforts to 
      eliminate health inequities.

TI  - Exclusion criteria in randomized clinical trials of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
PG  - 394
LID - 10.1007/s10143-025-03516-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Exclusion criteria are designed to optimize the scientific yield 
      and safety of clinical trials. However, periodic analysis is necessary to 
      understand the impact on trial complexity, enrollment, generalizability, and 
      costs. We analyzed the types of exclusion criteria used among clinical trials 
      performed in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients and impact upon exclusion of 
      patients. METHODS: We identified trials involving SAH patients that provided a 
      list of exclusion criteria and determined the number and proportion of those 
      trials which used various exclusion criteria, proportion of excluded patients for 
      each of the exclusion criteria and whether Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
      Trials (CONSORT) was used. We also used target trial emulation approach and 
      applied arbitrary trial exclusion criteria to a single center cohort of SAH 
      patients to determine proportions of patients excluded for each of the reasons 
      for exclusion. RESULTS: A total of 109 trials involving SAH patients were 
      identified, of which 68(62.3%) provided a list of the exclusion criteria. The 
      median number of exclusion criteria was 6 (range 2-9). The most common exclusion 
      criteria were pregnancy (n = 31 trials), SAH due to other causes (trauma, 
      fusiform or mycotic aneurysm, n = 26 trials) and significant liver 
      disease/hepatic insufficiency (n = 19 trials). CONSORT was used in 16(23.5%) 
      trials and 18 (16.5%) trials provided the proportion of patients excluded 
      according to each of the exclusion criteria. In a single center cohort, the 
      highest proportion of patients were excluded because no aneurysm was identified 
      on imaging (23%) followed by withdrawal of care (9.6%) and need for dual 
      anti-platelet treatment (8.6%). The in-hospital mortality was higher in patients 
      who were excluded as compared with those who were included in the hypothetical 
      trial (22 [30.1%] of 73 and 0 [0%] of 31 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis on 
      exclusion criteria used and proportion of patients excluded in clinical trials 
      involving SAH patients will assist in future trial enrollment, completion, and 
      generalizability. Standardized reporting using CONSORT in clinical trials 
      involving SAH patients is strongly recommended.

TI  - Immortal time bias from selection: a principal stratification perspective.
LID - kwaf146 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwaf146 [doi]
AB  - Immortal time bias due to post-treatment definition of eligibility criteria can 
      affect experimental and observational studies, and yet, in contrast to the 
      extensive literature on the classical form of immortal time bias, it has seldom 
      been the focus of methodological discussions. Here, we propose an account of 
      eligibility-related immortal time bias that uses the principal stratification 
      framework to explain the non-comparability of treatment arms (or exposure groups) 
      conditional on selection. In particular, we show that the statistical estimand 
      that conditions on observed eligibility after time zero of follow-up can be 
      interpreted using partially overlapping principal strata. Further, we show that, 
      under this perspective, as the timing of eligibility approaches time zero of 
      follow-up, the probabilities of the outcome for eligible individuals 
      monotonically approach the corresponding unconditional (in absence of selection) 
      expected potential outcomes under different treatment levels. Our study provides 
      a potential outcomes-based explanation of eligibility-related immortal time bias, 
      and indicates that, in addition to the target trial emulation framework, 
      principal effects might, for some studies, be useful causal estimands.

TI  - Arteriovenous access creation and hazards of hospitalization and death in 
      patients starting hemodialysis.
PG  - 978-988
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfad251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests an overestimation of the benefits associated 
      with arteriovenous (AV) fistula versus graft in certain populations. We assessed 
      hazards of all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization and death associated with 
      AV access type in patients who started hemodialysis with a catheter in France, 
      overall and by subgroups of age, sex and comorbidities. METHODS: We performed a 
      target trial emulation including patients who initiated hemodialysis with a 
      catheter from 2010 through 2018 and were followed by the REIN Registry. We 
      identified first-created fistula or graft through the French national 
      health-administrative database. We used joint frailty models to deal with 
      recurrent hospitalizations and potential informative censoring by death, and 
      inverse probability weighting to account for confounding. RESULTS: From the 
      18 800 patients included (mean age 68 ± 15 years, 35% women), 5% underwent AV 
      graft creation first. The weighted hazard ratio (wHR) of all-cause 
      hospitalization associated with graft was 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 
      to 1.15], that of vascular access-related hospitalization was 1.43 (95% CI 1.32 
      to 1.55), and those of cardiovascular- and infection-related hospitalizations 
      were 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.26) and 1.11 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.28), respectively. 
      Results were consistent for most subgroups, except that the highest hazard of 
      all-cause, cardiovascular- and infection-related hospitalizations with graft was 
      blunted in patients with comorbidities (i.e. diabetes, wHR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 
      1.10; 1.10, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.26; and 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients starting hemodialysis with a catheter, AV graft creation 
      is associated with increased hazard of vascular access-related hospitalizations 
      compared with fistula. This may not be the case for death or other causes of 
      hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the completeness of reporting, research transparency 
      practices, and risk of selection and immortal bias in observational studies using 
      routinely collected data for comparative effectiveness research. METHOD: We 
      performed a meta-research study by searching PubMed for comparative effectiveness 
      observational studies evaluating therapeutic interventions using routinely 
      collected data published in high impact factor journals from 01/06/2018 to 
      30/06/2020. We assessed the reporting of the study design (i.e., eligibility, 
      treatment assignment, and the start of follow-up). The risk of selection bias and 
      immortal time bias was determined by assessing if the time of eligibility, the 
      treatment assignment, and the start of follow-up were synchronized to mimic the 
      randomization following the target trial emulation framework. RESULT: 
      Seventy-seven articles were identified. Most studies evaluated pharmacological 
      treatments (69%) with a median sample size of 24,000 individuals. In total, 20% 
      of articles inadequately reported essential information of the study design. 
      One-third of the articles (n = 25, 33%) raised some concerns because of unclear 
      reporting (n = 6, 8%) or were at high risk of selection bias and/or immortal time 
      bias (n = 19, 25%). Only five articles (25%) described a solution to mitigate 
      these biases. Six articles (31%) discussed these biases in the limitations 
      section. CONCLUSION: Reporting of essential information of study design in 
      observational studies remained suboptimal. Selection bias and immortal time bias 
      were common methodological issues that researchers and physicians should be aware 
      of when interpreting the results of observational studies using routinely 
      collected data.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A lower-quality colonoscopy has been shown to be less effective in 
      reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence than a higher-quality colonoscopy, but 
      the comparison with no-screening colonoscopy (noSC) is lacking. We aimed to 
      compare the 13-year risk of developing CRC between persons with I) a 
      higher-quality screening colonoscopy (higherQualSC), II) a lower-quality 
      screening colonoscopy (lowerQualSC), and III) without a screening colonoscopy. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A health-care database (∼20% of the German population) 
      was used to emulate a target trial with three arms: higherQualSC vs lowerQualSC 
      vs noSC at baseline. The quality of screening colonoscopy was categorized based 
      on the polyp detection rate of the examining physician (cut-off: 21.8%). We 
      included persons aged 55-69 years at average CRC risk and CRC screening naïve at 
      baseline. We estimated adjusted cumulative CRC incidence over 13 years of 
      follow-up. RESULTS: The higherQualSC arm comprised 142,960 persons, the 
      lowerQualSC arm 62,338 persons, and the noSC arm 124,040 persons. The adjusted 
      13-year CRC risk was 1.77% in the higherQualSC arm, 2.09% in the lowerQualSC arm, 
      and 2.74% in the noSC arm. Compared to the noSC arm, the adjusted relative risk 
      was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.84) in the lowerQualSC arm and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60-0.69) 
      in the higherQualSC arm. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a lowerQualSC is also 
      effective in reducing CRC incidence compared to noSC. However, the effect is 
      about one-third less than that of a higherQualSC.

PG  - 275-289
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2024.240290R1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research is needed to measure the effects of shared decision-making 
      (SDM) on discontinuation of opioid therapy for chronic pain. DESIGN: Target trial 
      emulation. SETTING: National pain research registry from September 2016 to 
      January 2024. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 328 patients currently using opioid 
      therapy for chronic low back pain at baseline, including 164 patients each in 
      greater and lesser SDM groups matched on propensity scores. MEASUREMENTS: SDM was 
      measured with the Communication Behavior Questionnaire. Primary outcomes 
      involving discontinuation of opioid therapy and opioid prescribing frequency and 
      secondary outcomes of pain, function, and health-related quality of life were 
      measured over 12 months. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of patients was 56.1 (SD, 
      11.1) years and 239 (72.9%) were female. During 1178 quarterly encounters, 
      greater SDM was associated with less frequent discontinuation of opioid therapy 
      3 months postbaseline (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.86; P = .006) and more frequent 
      opioid prescribing 3 to 12 months postbaseline (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.11-1.38: 
      P < .001). Although greater SDM was associated with worse physical function, and 
      opioid therapy was associated with greater back-related disability and worse 
      physical function, these results were not clinically important. SDM x opioid 
      therapy interaction effects were not observed, indicating that more frequent use 
      of opioid therapy with SDM did not yield better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: SDM was 
      associated with less frequent short-term discontinuation of opioid therapy and 
      more frequent long-term opioid prescribing that was not associated with better 
      outcomes. Thus, SDM is necessary but insufficient to improve opioid prescribing 
      for patients with chronic pain.

TI  - Veteran Mental Health Emergency Care Utilization Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection.
PG  - e14622
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.14622 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Veterans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have an elevated 
      risk for needing mental health emergency care (MHEC) relative to uninfected 
      comparators, as measured by emergency department or urgent care clinic 
      utilization for a mental health diagnosis. DATA SOURCES/EXTRACTION: Data from 
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA), VHA-paid, and Centers for Medicare & 
      Medicaid-paid services were used to identify incident MHEC use within 1 year of 
      infection for Veterans with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched comparators. STUDY 
      DESIGN: This was a national, retrospective cohort study that leveraged a target 
      trial emulation framework to examine long-term outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      among Veterans enrolled in VHA care. Uninfected comparators were matched based on 
      month of infection, demographic, clinical, and health care utilization 
      characteristics. We calculated cumulative incidence rates per 10,000 persons and 
      utilized Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for MHEC up to one 
      year post-infection. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cohort included 207,968 Veterans 
      with SARS-CoV-2 and 1,036,944 comparators. The 365-day incidence of MHEC use was 
      greater among SARS-CoV-2 patients than comparators (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: [1.44, 
      1.52]). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 had a higher hazard for MHEC use than 
      comparators in all timeframes analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
      associated with increased MHEC use. Active care coordination with existing mental 
      health treatment providers may help mitigate post-infection mental health 
      distress. Future research should explore specific contextual factors contributing 
      to MHEC, such as gaps in continuity of care.

TI  - Medication use evaluation of tocilizumab implementation in COVID-19 treatment 
      guidelines: A causal inference approach.
PG  - e700-e710
LID - 10.1093/ajhp/zxae161 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Introduction of new medications to health-system formularies is often 
      not accompanied by assessments of their clinical impact on the local patient 
      population. The growing availability of electronic health record (EHR) data and 
      advancements in pharmacoepidemiology methods offer institutions the opportunity 
      to monitor the medication implementation process and assess clinical 
      effectiveness in the local clinical context. In this study, we applied novel 
      causal inference methods to evaluate the effects of a formulary policy 
      introducing tocilizumab therapy for critically ill patients with coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We conducted a medication use evaluation 
      utilizing EHR data from patients admitted to a large medical center during the 6 
      months before and after implementation of a formulary policy endorsing the use of 
      tocilizumab for treatment of COVID-19. The impact of tocilizumab on 28-day 
      all-cause mortality was assessed using a difference-in-differences analysis, with 
      ineligible patients serving as a nonequivalent control group, and a matched 
      analysis guided by a target trial emulation framework. Safety endpoints assessed 
      included the incidence of secondary infections and liver enzyme elevations. Our 
      findings were benchmarked against clinical trials, an observational study, and a 
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: Following guideline modification, tocilizumab was 
      administered to 69% of eligible patients. This implementation was associated with 
      a 3.1% absolute risk reduction in 28-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.86; number 
      needed to treat to prevent one death, 32) attributable to the inclusion of 
      tocilizumab in the guidelines and an additional 8.6% absolute risk reduction 
      (odds ratio, 0.65; number needed to treat to prevent one death, 12) linked to its 
      administration. These findings were consistent with estimates from published 
      literature, although the effect estimates from the difference-in-differences 
      analysis exhibited imprecision. CONCLUSION: Evaluating formulary management 
      decisions through novel causal inference approaches offers valuable estimates of 
      clinical effectiveness and the potential to optimize the impact of new 
      medications on population outcomes.

TI  - How much could anemia-related interventions reduce the HIV disparity in adverse 
      birth outcomes?
PG  - 122-131
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae160 [doi]
AB  - Women and other people of childbearing potential living with HIV (WLHIV) have a 
      higher risk of adverse birth outcomes than those without HIV (WWHIV). A higher 
      risk of anemia in WLHIV could partially explain this disparity. Using a birth 
      outcomes surveillance study in Botswana, we emulated target trials corresponding 
      to currently available or feasible interventions on anemia. The first target 
      trial evaluated 2 interventions: initiate multiple micronutrient supplementation 
      (MMS), and MMS or iron and folic acid supplementation by 24 weeks gestation. The 
      remaining target trials evaluated the interventions: eliminate anemia before 
      pregnancy; and jointly eliminate anemia before pregnancy and initiate MMS. We 
      estimated the observed disparity in adverse birth outcomes between WLHIV and 
      WWHIV and compared the observed disparity measure (ODM) to the counterfactual 
      disparity measure (CDM) under each intervention. Of 137 499 individuals (22% 
      WLHIV), the observed risk of any adverse birth outcome was 26.0% in WWHIV and 
      34.5% in WLHIV (ODM, 8.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-9.1%). 
      Counterfactual disparity measures (95% CIs) ranged from 6.6% (4.8-8.4%) for the 
      intervention to eliminate anemia and initiate MMS to 8.4% (7.7%-9.1%) for the 
      intervention to eliminate anemia only. Preventing anemia and expanding MMS may 
      reduce HIV disparities in birth outcomes, but interventions with greater impact 
      should be identified.

TI  - Sustained Hypothetical Interventions on Midlife Alcohol Consumption in Relation 
      to All-Cause and Cancer Mortality: The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's 
      Health.
PG  - 75-86
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwad164 [doi]
AB  - No randomized controlled trial has evaluated the effect of long-term alcohol 
      interventions on mortality. Results reported in existing observational studies 
      may be subject to selection bias and time-varying confounding. Using data from 
      the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health 1946-1951 birth cohort, 
      collected regularly from 1996-2016, we estimated all-cause and cancer mortality 
      had women been assigned various alcohol interventions (in categories ranging from 
      0 to >30 g/day ethanol, or reduced to ≤20 g/day if higher) at baseline, and had 
      they maintained these levels of consumption. The cumulative risks for all-cause 
      and cancer mortality were 5.6% (10,118 women followed for 20 years) and 2.9% (18 
      years), respectively. For all-cause and cancer mortality, baseline ethanol up to 
      30 g/day showed lower risk and >30 g/day showed higher risk relative to 
      abstention. Had women sustainedly followed the interventions, a similar 
      relationship was observed for all-cause mortality. However, the negative 
      association observed for intakes ≤30 g/day and positive association for intakes 
      >30 g/day was not evident for cancer mortality. Our findings suggest that 
      all-cause mortality could have been lower than observed if this cohort of women 
      had consumed some alcohol (no more than 30 g/day) rather than no consumption, but 
      cancer mortality might not.

TI  - Flexible Approaches Based on Multistate Models and Microsimulation to Perform 
      Real-World Cost-Effectiveness Analyses: An Application to Proprotein Convertase

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to show the application of flexible statistical 
      methods in real-world cost-effectiveness analyses applied in the cardiovascular 
      field, focusing specifically on the use of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin 
      type 9 inhibitors for hyperlipidemia. METHODS: The proposed method allowed us to 
      use an electronic health database to emulate a target trial for 
      cost-effectiveness analysis using multistate modeling and microsimulation. We 
      formally established the study design and provided precise definitions of the 
      causal measures of interest while also outlining the assumptions necessary for 
      accurately estimating these measures using the available data. Additionally, we 
      thoroughly considered goodness-of-fit assessments and sensitivity analyses of the 
      decision model, which are crucial to capture the complexity of individuals' 
      healthcare pathway and to enhance the validity of this type of health economic 
      models. RESULTS: In the disease model, the Markov assumption was found to be 
      inadequate, and a "time-reset" timescale was implemented together with the use of 
      a time-dependent variable to incorporate past hospitalization history. 
      Furthermore, the microsimulation decision model demonstrated a satisfying 
      goodness of fit, as evidenced by the consistent results obtained in the 
      short-term horizon compared with a nonmodel-based approach. Notably, proprotein 
      convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors revealed their favorable 
      cost-effectiveness only in the long-term follow-up, with a minimum willingness to 
      pay of 39 000 Euro/life years gained. CONCLUSIONS: The approach demonstrated its 
      significant utility in several ways. Unlike nonmodel-based or alternative 
      model-based methods, it enabled to (1) investigate long-term cost-effectiveness 
      comprehensively, (2) use an appropriate disease model that aligns with the 
      specific problem under study, and (3) conduct subgroup-specific 
      cost-effectiveness analyses to gain more targeted insights.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare risk of intentional self-harm and overdose after visits for 
      opioid use disorder (OUD) followed by starting vs. not starting buprenorphine. 
      METHODS: Records from four health systems identified visits during 
      1/1/2012-12/31/2019 by health system members aged 13 or older with OUD diagnosis 
      and no recent OUD medication. Following a target-trial emulation approach, visits 
      followed by buprenorphine dispensing within 7 days were matched to unexposed 
      visits. Analyses compared risk of diagnosed self-harm injury or poisoning 
      (primary outcome) as well as opioid-involved poisoning and any injury or 
      poisoning (secondary outcomes) within 90 days. RESULTS: Among 183,809 visits by 
      30,955 patients, 15,508 (8.4 %) had buprenorphine dispensing within 7 days, and 
      2260 (1.2 %) had self-harm diagnosis within 90 days. Average duration of 
      buprenorphine treatment before interruption was 44.3 days (SD 32.1). In primary 
      intention-to-treat analyses using logistic regression and adjusting for baseline 
      risk of self-harm, starting buprenorphine was not associated with significant 
      difference in self-harm (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, 95 % CI 0.81-1.24) or 
      opioid-involved poisoning (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 0.86-1.38). In secondary as-treated 
      analyses censoring outcomes after treatment change, buprenorphine initiation was 
      associated with no significant difference in hazard of self-harm (Hazard Ratio 
      [HR] 0.74, 95 % CI 0.53-1.02) and with significantly lower hazard of 
      opioid-involved poisoning (HR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.43-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Among people 
      with OUD, starting buprenorphine was not followed by lower risk of self-harm, 
      likely reflecting frequent discontinuation and high risk of self-harm or overdose 
      shortly after discontinuation. These findings reinforce the need to improve 
      treatment continuity among those starting buprenorphine.

TI  - Causal effect of chemotherapy received dose intensity on survival outcome: a 
      retrospective study in osteosarcoma.
PG  - 296
LID - 10.1186/s12874-024-02416-x [doi]
LID - 296
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to analyse the effects of reducing Received Dose 
      Intensity (RDI) in chemotherapy treatment for osteosarcoma patients on their 
      survival by using a novel approach. Previous research has highlighted 
      discrepancies between planned and actual RDI, even among patients randomized to 
      the same treatment regimen. To mitigate toxic side effects, treatment 
      adjustments, such as dose reduction or delayed courses, are necessary. Toxicities 
      are therefore risk factors for mortality and predictors of future exposure 
      levels. Toxicity introduces post-assignment confounding when assessing the causal 
      effect of chemotherapy RDI on survival outcomes, a topic of ongoing debate. 
      METHODS: Chemotherapy administration data from BO03 and BO06 Randomized Clinical 
      Trials (RCTs) in ostosarcoma are employed to emulate a target trial with three 
      RDI-based exposure strategies: 1) standard, 2) reduced, and 3) highly-reduced 
      RDI. Investigations are conducted between subgroups of patients characterised by 
      poor or good Histological Responses (HRe), i.e., the strongest known prognostic 
      factor for survival in osteosarcoma. Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting 
      (IPTW) is first used to transform the original population into a 
      pseudo-population which mimics the target randomized cohort. Then, a Marginal 
      Structural Cox Model with effect modification is employed. Conditional Average 
      Treatment Effects (CATEs) are ultimately measured as the difference between the 
      Restricted Mean Survival Time of reduced/highly-reduced RDI strategy and the 
      standard one. Confidence Intervals for CATEs are obtained using a novel 
      IPTW-based bootstrap procedure. RESULTS: Significant effect modifications based 
      on HRe were found. Increasing RDI-reductions led to contrasting trends for poor 
      and good responders: the higher the reduction, the better (worsen) was the 
      survival in poor (good) reponders. Due to their intrinsic resistance to 
      chemotherapy, poor reponders could benefit from reduced RDI, with an average gain 
      of 10.2 and 15.4 months at 5-year for reduced and highly-reduced exposures, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces a novel approach to (i) 
      comprehensively address the challenges related to the analysis of chemotherapy 
      data, (ii) mitigate the toxicity-treatment-adjustment bias, and (iii) repurpose 
      existing RCT data for retrospective analyses extending beyond the original 
      trials' intended scopes.

AB  - As-needed blood pressure (BP) medication used to treat asymptomatic BP elevations 
      in the hospital may be harmful. However, its association with hospitalization 
      costs remains unknown. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with target 
      trial emulation and propensity-score matching to compare the total and subtype 
      hospitalization costs for those who received as-needed BP medication (YES) versus 
      not (NO) during a Veterans Affairs hospital stay between October 1, 2015 and 
      September 30, 2020. After matching (n = 25,455 per group), the as-needed YES 
      group had a longer length of stay compared to the NO group. Hospitalizations in 
      the YES group were associated with higher total and subtype hospitalization costs 
      compared to the NO group. Similarly, individuals in the YES group had higher 
      daily total hospital costs compared to the NO group, driven primarily by 
      increased nursing and surgery costs. Our findings suggest that the expenditure 
      implications of as-needed BP medication use merit further investigation.

TI  - Incident Diuretic Use and Subsequent Risk of Bone Fractures: A Large Nationwide 
      Observational Study of US Veterans.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of incident use of diuretics with 
      subsequent risk of incident bone fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a nationwide 
      cohort of 863,339 US veterans receiving care from the VA health care system 
      between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, with follow-up through June 30, 
      2018, we examined the association of incident diuretic use (overall, and 
      separately by thiazide, loop, and potassium-sparing diuretics) with subsequent 
      risk of incident bone fractures using multivariable Cox regression models while 
      minimizing confounding by indication using a target trial emulation approach. 
      RESULTS: Patients were 63.3±12.9 years old; 93.5% (n=807,180) were male; and 
      27.1% (n=233,996) were diabetic. Their baseline estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate was 84.4±16.5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). Among 863,339 patients, 424,386 (49.2%) 
      newly initiated diuretics, of which 77.4% (n=328,524), 22.5% (n=95,457), and 0.1% 
      (n=405) were thiazide, loop, and potassium-sparing diuretic users, respectively. 
      After multivariable adjustments, incident diuretic use (vs non-use) was 
      significantly associated with higher risk of incident fracture (adjusted HR 
      [aHR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.16). The association was most pronounced for loop 
      diuretics (aHR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.44) but less evident for thiazide 
      diuretics (aHR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.10) and was not significant for 
      potassium-sparing diuretics (aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.52). The 
      diuretic-fracture association was more evident in younger (vs older) patients, 
      those with (vs without) corticosteroid use, and those with lower (vs higher) 
      serum sodium levels. CONCLUSION: Incident use of diuretics, particularly loop 
      diuretics, was independently associated with higher risk of incident bone 
      fractures. Our findings suggest distinct pathophysiologic contributions of 
      diuretics to bone metabolism and the need for careful attention to skeletal 
      outcomes when initiating diuretics.

TI  - Improving the quality of evidence production in rehabilitation. Results of the 
      5th Cochrane Rehabilitation Methodological Meeting.
PG  - 130-134

AB  - The paper introduces the Special Sections of the European Journal of Physical and 
      Rehabilitation Medicine dedicated to the 5(th) Methodological Meeting of Cochrane 
      Rehabilitation. It introduces Cochrane Rehabilitation; its vision, mission and 
      goals; discusses why the Methodological Meetings were created; and reports on 
      their organisation and previous outcomes. The core content of this editorial is 
      the 5(th) Methodological Meeting held in Milan in September 2023. The original 
      title for this meeting was "The Rehabilitation Evidence Ecosystem: useful study 
      designs." The focus of the Milan meeting was informed by the lessons learned by 
      Cochrane Rehabilitation in the past few years, by the new rehabilitation 
      definition for research purposes, by the collaboration with the World Health 
      Organization (WHO), and by the REH-COVER (Rehabilitation COVID-19 Evidence-Based 
      Response) action. During the Meeting, participants discussed the current 
      methodological evidence on the following: RCTs in rehabilitation coming from 
      meta-epidemiological studies; observational study designs - specifically the 
      IDEAL Framework (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study) and 
      its potential implementation in rehabilitation and the Target Trial Emulation 
      framework: Single Case Experimental Designs; complex intervention studies: health 
      services research studies, and studies using qualitative approaches. The Meeting 
      culminated in the development of a first version of a "road map" to navigate the 
      evidence production in rehabilitation according to the previous discussions. The 
      Special Sections' papers present all topics discussed at the meeting, and a 
      methodological paper about choosing the right research question, presenting final 
      results and the "road map" for evidence production in rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on the long-term impact of beta-blocker therapy 
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with stable coronary 
      artery disease (CAD) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of early 
      beta-blocker initiation vs no initiation following PCI in patients with stable 
      CAD and preserved LVEF. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study employed target 
      trial emulation and incident user design, utilizing the TriNetx database 
      (2009-2024). Early beta-blocker initiation (within days 1 and 7) was compared 
      with no initiation using 1:1 greedy propensity score matching. The outcomes 
      included all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, heart 
      failure, atrial fibrillation/flutter, stroke, and safety endpoints. 
      Hospitalization for bone fracture and acute appendicitis served as falsification 
      endpoints. In the intention-to-treat analysis, outcomes were analyzed over 
      5 years using Cox-proportional hazards. RESULTS: Out of 11,681 matched patients 
      per group, beta-blocker therapy was associated with increased all-cause mortality 
      (HR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.09-1.18]). No significant differences were found in 
      hospitalization for myocardial infarction (HR: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.97-1.09]), stroke 
      (HR: 0.98 [95% CI: 0.91-1.05]), heart failure (HR: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.95-1.03]), and 
      atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.93-1.01]). Hospitalization for 
      hypotension was higher with beta-blockers (HR: 1.10 [95% CI: 1.06-1.14]). 
      Hospitalization for bone fracture (HR: 1.02 [95% CI: 0.85-1.22]) and acute 
      appendicitis (HR: 1.17 [95% CI: 0.95-1.45]) showed no significant associations. 
      Several sensitivity analyses showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: Early 
      beta-blocker initiation after PCI for stable CAD with preserved LVEF was 
      associated with higher mortality, with no impact on cardiovascular events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition (ARNI) reduces mortality and 
      morbidity in chronic heart failure, but its efficacy in acute myocardial 
      infarction (MI) remains uncertain. This study compares ARNI versus angiotensin 
      receptor blockers (ARB) in acute MI patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This cohort 
      study used a target trial emulation approach to include acute MI patients between 
      2019 and 2022 from the Tianjin Health and Medical Data Platform, China. Eligible 
      patients newly prescribed ARB or ARNI during hospitalization were matched 1:1 
      using propensity scores. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days 
      and 1 year. Time-dependent hazard ratio (HR) was used to the explore potential 
      benefit window of ARNI. The matched cohort included 10,480 patients (5240 per 
      group) for intention-to-treat analysis, with 701 deaths (6.7 %) recorded. 
      Compared with ARB, ARNI was significantly associated with a lower 30-day 
      mortality risk (HR: 0.68, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.88) but showed no 
      association with 1-year mortality (HR: 0.99, 95 % CI: 0.85-1.14). Exploratory 
      analysis indicates that the beneficial effect of ARNI extends to 60 days (HR: 
      0.68, 95 % CI: 0.52-0.88). No significant differences were observed for recurrent 
      MI (HR: 0.98, 95 % CI: 0.87-1.10) or stroke (HR: 1.15, 95 % CI: 0.98-1.35). 
      Subgroup analysis indicated a particular benefit of ARNI in heart failure 
      patients at 60 days (HR: 0.75, 95 % CI: 0.58-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      acute MI, ARNI was associated with improved survival compared to ARB within the 
      first 60 days. This survival benefit diminished over time, with no significant 
      difference observed at 1-year follow-up.

TI  - Effects of Initiating Different Antidepressant Subclasses on Motor Vehicle Crash 
      Risk Among Older Adults With Depression.
LID - 10.1111/jgs.19527 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antidepressants are prescribed for depression among older adults but 
      might increase the risk of motor vehicle crash (MVC) through adverse effects 
      (AEs) like sedation, dizziness, and blurred vision. Antidepressant subclasses may 
      have different MVC risks since AE risks vary across subclasses. Our objective was 
      to estimate the comparative one-year risks of MVC upon initiating atypical (AA) 
      or tricyclic (TCA) versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
      antidepressants. METHODS: We emulated 470 sequential target trials each week from 
      January 6, 2008, through January 1, 2017, using Medicare fee-for-service claims 
      linked to New Jersey police-reported MVCs and driver's licensing data. Our 
      sequential target trial emulation included older adults aged ≥ 66 years with a 
      recent diagnosis of depression who initiated AAs, SSRIs, or TCAs. The unit of 
      analysis was the "person-trial" a unique instance of a person in a sequential 
      trial. Using inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted Kaplan-Meier 
      estimators to account for potential confounding and selection bias, we estimated 
      the intention-to-treat cumulative incidence and risk ratios (RRs) of MVC over 
      1 year of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 13,034 person-trials from 11,604 
      persons (median [first quartile, third quartile] age: 76.0 [71.0, 82.0] years, 
      69.8% female, 89.4% non-Hispanic White race). There were 31 (37.6 [95% confidence 
      limits {CLs} 20.3, 59.5] per 1000), 65 (37.6 [95% CLs 25.7, 47.7] per 1000), and 
      380 (38.0 [95% CLs 24.1, 39.7] per 1000) MVCs among 644 TCA-treated, 2130 
      AA-treated, and 10,260 SSRI-treated person-trials, respectively. The adjusted RRs 
      were 0.99 (95% CLs 0.72, 1.56) comparing AAs versus SSRIs and 0.99 (95% CLs 0.56, 
      1.86) comparing TCAs versus SSRIs. CONCLUSION: We observed no differences in the 
      one-year risk of MVC between antidepressant subclasses. When selecting among 
      antidepressant subclasses to manage depression in older adults, MVC risk should 
      not guide prescribing decisions, and other considerations should take precedence.

      antidepressants.

LID - 10.1101/2024.11.02.24316657 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Antidepressants are recommended as the initial choice of treatment 
      for moderate and severe depression, but the choice of antidepressant class can be 
      challenging, with the possibility of serious adverse events such as increased 
      suicidality with antidepressant initiation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of 
      polygenic scores in predicting heterogeneous effects of antidepressants on 
      suicidal thoughts. DESIGN: Using genetic and clinical data on both children and 
      adults with major depressive disorder from the All of Us Research Program, we 
      used a target trial emulation framework to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of 
      antidepressants on suicidal thoughts across genetic characteristics. SETTING: 
      Longitudinal cohort from the All of Us Research Program. PARTICIPANTS: More than 
      7,000 patients, both children and adults, with major depressive disorder. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The initiation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
      compared to the initiation of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
      (SNRIs) and bupropion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The effects of antidepressants 
      on suicidal thoughts, as well as subgroup effects across polygenic scores (PGSs) 
      of various psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: Patients with higher PGS for 
      psychiatric disorders, particularly for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD), were more likely than those with lower scores to experience suicidal 
      thoughts with the initiation of SSRIs, relative to bupropion (hazard ratio 1.66, 
      95%CI, 1.30-2.12, for participants with ADHD PGS higher than median vs. hazard 
      ratio 1.06, 95%CI, 0.81-1.38, for participants with ADHD PGS lower than median; 
      P-for-interaction, 0.01). We observed a similar trend for schizophrenia, although 
      the interaction was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 1.52, 95%CI, 
      1.19-1.93, for participants with schizophrenia PGS higher than median vs. hazard 
      ratio 1.1.17, 95%CI, 0.89-1.53, for participants with ADHD PGS lower than median; 
      P-for-interaction, 0.16). We did not observe differences in the effects of SSRIs 
      relative to SNRIs across PGSs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The genetic 
      predisposition to psychiatric disorders may, at least partially, underlie the 
      heterogeneity in the risk of suicidal thoughts with antidepressant use. In the 
      personalized medicine framework, PGSs for various psychiatric disorders may help 
      tailor antidepressants to each patient to avoid serious adverse effects such as 
      suicidal thoughts. KEY POINTS: Question : How much do polygenic scores of 
      psychiatric diseases predict the heterogeneity in the effects of antidepressants 
      on suicidal thoughts? Findings : The genetic predisposition to psychiatric 
      disorders may, at least partially, underlie the heterogeneity in the risk of 
      suicidal thoughts with antidepressant use. Meaning : Polygenic scores for 
      psychiatric disorders may help tailor antidepressants to each patient to avoid 
      suicidal thoughts with their initiation, contributing to personalized psychiatry.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine transitions to a nursing home among residents of assisted 
      living relative to community-dwelling home care recipients. DESIGN: 
      Population-based retrospective cohort study emulating a target trial. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Linked, individual-level health system data were obtained from 
      older adults (aged ≥65 years) who made an incident application for a bed in a 
      nursing home in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2019, and 
      were followed until December 31, 2019. METHODS: Residency in assisted living was 
      compared with only community-dwelling home care. Any long-stay (≥90 days) and 
      short-stay (<90 days) transitions to a nursing home were examined. Inverse 
      probability weighted pooled logistic regression models were used to generate 
      marginal cumulative incidence curves under each exposure status that were 
      standardized by the covariates. RESULTS: This study included 10,012 residents of 
      assisted living [mean (SD) aged 88.7 (6.26) years, 75% female] and 131,679 home 
      care recipients [mean (SD) aged 84.8 (7.43) years, 63% female] who applied for a 
      bed in a nursing home (N = 141,691; 95,744.6 person-years). There were 6049 
      transitions among applicants from assisted living and 85,190 transitions among 
      applicants who were home care recipients to a nursing home. The 5-year absolute 
      risk reduction was 110 transitions to a nursing home per 1000 older adult 
      applicants if all applicants resided in assisted living (95% CI, 71-148). 
      Residency in assisted living resulted in a 12.7% relative decrease in the 5-year 
      risk of any transition to a nursing home had all applicants resided in assisted 
      living (95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Residents of assisted 
      living were less likely to transition to a nursing home, despite equivalent 
      clinical complexity and health care needs. The integration of assisted living 
      into the continuum of care from the community to institutionalized nursing homes 
      would better inform health system capacity and planning.

      general population and at-risk children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Specific modifiable factors (e.g., screen time [ST], sleep duration, 
      physical activity, or social connections) are targets for reducing depression 
      risk in adults. However, research in adolescents lacks causal inference 
      implementations, as prevention trials are costly and often prohibitive. Emulating 
      randomized trials with observational data enables inference regarding 
      hypothetical interventions on modifiable factors that reduce depression risk, in 
      general and at-risk populations. METHOD: Data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive 
      Development (N = 8,699) and the Generation R (N = 3,739) studies were leveraged 
      for modifiable factors (age 10) and internalizing symptoms (age 12-14). We (a) 
      tested prospective associations of each modifiable factor with internalizing 
      symptoms under target trial emulation (TTE) and (b) used G-formula to estimate 
      the potential effects on internalizing symptoms if hypothetical interventions 
      were implemented. Analyses were conducted in the full sample (universal 
      prevention setting) and at-risk youth (selective and indicated prevention 
      setting). RESULTS: First, under TTE, only ST associated with internalizing 
      symptoms. Second, in the universal prevention setting, adhering to more stringent 
      ST guidelines (0-1 hr) decreased internalizing symptoms by 0.10-0.16 SDs while 
      following more lenient guidelines (3-4 hr) increased them by 0.07-0.09 SDs, 
      compared to existing guidelines (2 hr). Such changes were greater in the 
      indicated (subclinical symptom) prevention settings and robust to residual 
      confounding. Restricting physical activity reduced internalizing risk in the 
      indicated setting, but findings were not robust. CONCLUSIONS: With a causally 
      informed strategy, we demonstrated the potential effects of numerous hypothetical 
      interventions on modifiable factors for depression risk reduction, across 
      multiple preventive settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights

TI  - Impacts of testing and immunity acquired through vaccination and infection on 
      covid-19 cases in Massachusetts elementary and secondary students.
PG  - 202

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the 2021-22 academic year, Massachusetts supported several 
      in-school testing programs to facilitate in-person learning. Additionally, 
      COVID-19 vaccines became available to all school-aged children and many were 
      infected with SARS-CoV-2. There are limited studies evaluating the impacts of 
      these testing programs on SARS-CoV-2 cases in elementary and secondary school 
      settings. The aim of this state-wide, retrospective cohort study was to assess 
      the impact of testing programs and immunity on SARS-CoV-2 case rates in 
      elementary and secondary students. METHODS: Community-level vaccination and 
      cumulative incidence rates were combined with data about participation in and 
      results of in-school testing programs (test-to-stay, pooled surveillance 
      testing). School-level impacts of surveillance testing programs on SARS-CoV-2 
      cases in students were estimated using generalized estimating equations within a 
      target trial emulation approach stratified by school type 
      (elementary/middle/high). Impacts of immunity and vaccination were estimated 
      using random effects linear regression. RESULTS: Here we show that among 
      N = 652,353 students at 2141 schools participating in in-school testing programs, 
      surveillance testing is associated with a small but measurable decrease in 
      in-school positivity rates. During delta, pooled testing positivity rates are 
      higher in communities with higher cumulative incidence of infection. During 
      omicron, when immunity from prior infection became more prevalent, the effect 
      reversed, such that communities with lower burden of infection during the earlier 
      phases of the pandemic had higher infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Testing programs 
      are an effective strategy for supporting in-person learning. Fluctuating levels 
      of immunity acquired via natural infection or vaccination are a major determinant 
      of SARS-CoV-2 cases in schools.

OAB - During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, multiple strategies were used to 
      enable students to participate in in-person elementary and secondary schools. 
      Little is known about the overall impact of prior immunity and in-person testing 
      programs on the ability to maintain protection from Covid-19 in schools. This 
      study, conducted in Massachusetts during the 2021-2022 academic year, found that 
      community immunity gained through prior infection or vaccination, combined with 
      testing strategies including testing programs to monitor infection and test 
      to-stay modified quarantine programs, were safe and effective for allowing 
      in-person learning. These data can be used to shape policy about in-school 
      practices during future respiratory virus pandemics.

TI  - Antihypertensive Deprescribing and Functional Status in VA Long-Term Care 
      Residents With and Without Dementia.
PG  - 1144-1154
LID - 10.1111/jgs.19342 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deprescribing antihypertensives is of growing interest in geriatric 
      medicine, yet the impact on functional status is unknown. We emulated a target 
      trial of deprescribing antihypertensive medications compared with continued use 
      on functional status measured by activities of daily living (ADL) in a long-term 
      care population. METHODS: We included 12,238 Veteran Affairs long-term care 
      residents age 65+ who had a stay ≥ 12 weeks between 2006 and 2019. After 4+ weeks 
      of stable antihypertensive medication use, residents were classified as either 
      deprescribed antihypertensives (reduced ≥ 1 medication or ≥ 30% dose) or 
      continued users. Residents were followed up for 2 years, or censored at 
      discharge, admission to hospice, protocol deviation (per-protocol analysis only), 
      or Sept 30, 2019. The outcome was ADL dependencies (scored 0-28; higher 
      score = worse functionality), assessed approximately every 3 months. Our primary 
      approach was to estimate per-protocol effects using linear mixed-effects 
      regressions with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighting, 
      overall and stratified by dementia status. We estimated intention-to-treat 
      effects as a secondary analysis. RESULTS: In long-term care residents, ADL scores 
      worsened by a mean of 0.29 points (95%CI = 0.27, 0.31) per 3 months and 
      antihypertensive deprescribing did not impact this worsening (difference between 
      groups -0.04 points every 3 months, 95%CI = -0.15, 0.06). In the non-dementia 
      subgroup, ADL worsened by 0.15 points (95%CI = 0.11, 0.19) every 3 months. 
      However, residents who were deprescribed showed a slightly improved ADL score 
      over time while the continued users showed ADL decline (difference between groups 
      -0.23 points every 3 months, 95%CI = -0.43, -0.03). Deprescribing was not 
      associated with ADL change in the dementia subgroup. The intention-to-treat 
      results were not meaningfully different. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive 
      deprescribing did not have a deleterious effect on functional status in long-term 
      care residents with or without dementia. This may be reassuring to residents and 
      clinicians who are considering antihypertensive medication reduction or 
      discontinuation in long-term care settings.

TI  - Oral glucocorticoids and risk of psychiatric and suicidal behaviour outcomes: 
      population-based cohort study.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1192/bjp.2025.128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of associations between glucocorticoid treatment and 
      adverse psychiatric and suicidal behaviour outcomes, large-scale observational 
      evidence for serious outcomes is lacking. AIMS: To assess the risk of psychiatric 
      and suicidal behaviour outcomes during glucocorticoid treatment. METHOD: Using 
      Swedish population registers, we identified 1 105 964 individuals aged 15-54 
      years who collected a glucocorticoid prescription in oral form between 2006 and 
      2020. We investigated associations with a range of psychiatric outcomes: 
      unplanned specialist healthcare contacts due to depressive, bipolar, anxiety or 
      schizophrenia-spectrum disorders; and deaths by suicide or unplanned specialist 
      healthcare contacts due to self-harm ('suicidal behaviour'). We estimated hazard 
      ratios from Cox proportional hazards models in a medication-only cohort by 
      comparing outcome rates during and outside treated periods within individuals. We 
      further identified individuals with an autoimmune or gastrointestinal autoimmune 
      disorder diagnosis and compared hazards of the outcomes between those who did and 
      did not initiate a glucocorticoid using a target trial emulation approach. 
      RESULTS: We found increased risks for psychiatric outcomes, with 
      within-individual hazard ratios ranging from 1.08 (95% CI, 1.00-1.16) for 
      depressive disorders to 1.23 (95% CI, 1.12-1.36) for bipolar disorder and 1.25 
      (95% CI, 1.20-1.31) for anxiety disorders. We found no clear association with 
      suicidal behaviour (hazard ratio: 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96-1.17). These findings were 
      similar when stratified by age and gender. Within-individual associations were 
      attenuated in those diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. The risk of anxiety 
      and bipolar disorder outcomes appeared particularly elevated in the first weeks 
      of treatment. Absolute rates were modestly elevated during treatment, and higher 
      in those with a history of psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Glucocorticoid 
      treatment is associated with elevated risks of serious psychiatric outcomes, 
      including the onset and relapse of common psychiatric disorders. Individuals with 
      psychiatric histories may require additional monitoring during glucocorticoid 
      treatment.

TI  - Misleading and avoidably: design-induced biases in observational studies 
      evaluating cancer screening-the example of site-specific effectiveness of 
      screening colonoscopy.
LID - kwaf069 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwaf069 [doi]
AB  - Observational studies evaluating the effectiveness of cancer screening are often 
      biased due to non-alignment at time zero, which can be avoided by target trial 
      emulation (TTE). We aimed to illustrate this by evaluating site-specific 
      effectiveness of screening colonoscopy regarding colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      incidence. Based on a German health care database, we assessed the effect of 
      screening colonoscopy vs. no screening colonoscopy in preventing CRC in the 
      distal and the proximal colon over 12 years of follow-up in 55-69-year-old 
      persons. We compared four different study designs: cohort and case-control study, 
      each with/without alignment at time zero. In both analyses with time 
      zero-alignment, screening colonoscopy showed a rather similar effectiveness in 
      reducing the incidence of distal and proximal CRC (cohort analysis: 32% (95% CI: 
      27-37%) vs. 28% (20-35%); case-control analysis: 27% vs. 33%). Both analyses 
      without alignment suggested a difference by site: Incidence reduction regarding 
      distal and proximal CRC, respectively, was 65% (61-68%) vs. 37% (31-43%) in the 
      cohort analysis and 77% (67-84%) vs. 46% (25-61%) in the case-control analysis. 
      Violations of basic design principles can substantially bias the results of 
      observational studies. In our example, it falsely suggested a much stronger 
      preventive effect of colonoscopy in the distal vs. the proximal colon. Our study 
      illustrates that TTE avoids such design-induced biases.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors 
      (SGLT2i) on dialysis, cardiovascular, and mortality risks in patients with 
      polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Using a 
      target trial emulation within the TriNetX U.S. network (2015-2022), we identified 
      31,070 patients with both PKD and T2D. Three emulated trials were constructed via 
      propensity score matching: SGLT2i vs. non-users (n = 2640 pairs), SGLT2i vs. 
      DPP-4 inhibitors (n = 2016), and SGLT2i vs. GLP-1 receptor agonists (n = 1870). 
      Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). 
      RESULTS: Compared with non-users, SGLT2i users had lower risks of dialysis (HR: 
      0.657), acute kidney injury (AKI; HR: 0.896), and mortality (HR: 0.840). Against 
      DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2i use was associated with reduced risks of dialysis (HR: 
      0.458), AKI (HR: 0.835), and mortality (HR: 0.813). Compared with GLP-1 RAs, 
      SGLT2i users had a lower dialysis risk (HR: 0.531). CONCLUSION: SGLT2i use was 
      associated with reduced risks of dialysis, AKI, and mortality in patients with 
      PKD and T2D. These findings highlight a potential renal and survival benefit in 
      this high-risk group. However, results were derived using an emulation protocol 
      and propensity score methods based on electronic health records. KEY POINT: 
      SGLT2i users were associated with a lower risk of dialysis, acute kidney injury, 
      and mortality than non-SGLT2i users.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Observational evidence of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection is often limited by differences in testing 
      behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. This study aimed to 
      estimate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection among students using data from a school 
      district opt-in weekly testing program. METHODS: An observational, matched cohort 
      study to emulate a target vaccine trial was conducted among students attending an 
      urban school district in the Southeastern United States. Between 9/7/21 and 
      5/26/22, 9172 children, among 24,188 total students participating in the testing 
      program, were followed from vaccination date, determined by state immunizations 
      information systems (IIS) records, to first positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen 
      test, regardless of symptoms, conducted through the testing program. Hazard 
      ratios and their 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional 
      hazards models, and VE was calculated as (1-hazard ratio)*100. All analyses were 
      stratified by age group (5-11 years and 12 years and older) and sensitivity 
      analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Among students aged 5-11 years, VE against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection within 60 days of first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine was 
      42.9 % (95 % CI, 7.1 % to 78.7 %) and waned to 20.7 % (95 %, CI 0.0 % to 41.8 %) 
      by 180 days. Over the full study period, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
      14.9 % (95 % CI, -5.0 % to 34.7 %). Among students 12 years and older, VE against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection was -5.0 % (95 % CI, -37.0 % to 26.5 %) over the full study 
      period. Insufficient data was available to estimate VE within 60 days of 
      vaccination in this age group. CONCLUSIONS: Among 5-11 year olds participating in 
      a routine SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing program, VE against SARS-CoV-2 
      infection was modest immediately following vaccination but waned over the school 
      year. This analysis limits biases found in traditional VE studies related to 
      differential testing behaviors and allows estimation of VE against infection, 
      regardless of symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: School masking mandates were widely adopted as a pandemic control 
      measure, however, limited data are available regarding their effectiveness as a 
      strategy for reducing burden of disease in the surrounding community. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate the impact of school masking policy de-adoption (mask-lifting) on 
      SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates, hospitalizations, and deaths in the surrounding 
      community. METHODS: Design: Retrospective observational study with an event study 
      design, a difference-in-difference method; a target trial emulation (TTE) 
      framework was applied as a secondary analysis. Cohort creation: Data collected 
      from 9/2021 to 6/2022 on SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalizations, deaths and 
      vaccination rates were combined with district-level masking policy data. 
      Analysis: In the event study, the impact of masking policy de-adoption on 
      SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100,000 county residents stratified by age during the 8-week 
      period following the policy change was estimated. Effects on hospitalization and 
      deaths per 1,000,000 residents were secondarily estimated. In a secondary 
      analysis, a target trial emulation framework was applied to estimate average 
      treatment effects. RESULTS: N = 3,970 districts composed of 53,453 schools were 
      included in the cohort. In the event study, no consistent trends for COVID-19 
      case rates were identified for the whole cohort or for any age group. For the 
      whole cohort, there was a statistically significant increase found 6-8 weeks 
      following the policy change (maximum increase, 1.91 hospitalizations per 
      1,000,000 county residents); increases in hospitalizations were also found in the 
      stratified analysis for all age groups, although absolute impacts were small. An 
      increase in deaths was found during the period from 4 to 7 weeks following the 
      policy change (maximum increase 0.62 deaths per 1,000,000 residents). In the 
      stratified analysis, small increases in death rates were seen in 50-69 year olds 
      (range, 0.088-1.49) and >70 year olds (range, 0.23-2.58) but not in younger 
      groups. In the TTE framework, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were similar in 
      control and intervention counties. CONCLUSION: This study evaluating the impact 
      of lifting of mask mandates in schools, analyzed in two ways, was consistent 
      results ranging from no impact to a small but statistically significant impact of 
      the policy change on SARS-CoV-2 case and severe outcomes rates in the surrounding 
      community. Findings can be used to inform future pandemic policy responses for 
      elementary and secondary schools.

TI  - The effect of a Veterans Affairs rapid rehousing and homelessness prevention 
      program on long-term housing instability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of enrolling in Supportive Services for Veteran 
      Families (SSVF) on short- and long-term housing outcomes among Veterans 
      experiencing housing instability. STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: We analyzed data from 
      the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health record (EHR) between 
      October 2015 and December 2018 using the target trial emulation framework. 
      Veterans were included in one or more trials if they were 18 years or older, had 
      recent evidence of housing instability, had received care in VA for at least 
      1 year, and had never before enrolled in SSVF. Patients who enrolled in SSVF 
      after meeting eligibility were assigned to the treatment group, while patients 
      who did not enroll in SSVF were assigned to a control group. We extracted 
      patients' housing outcomes from the EHR and modeled the probability of being 
      unstably housed each day while accounting for confounders and irregular visit 
      times. DATA SOURCES AND ANALYTIC SAMPLE: We extracted housing status and 
      covariates from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Housing instability was 
      ascertained using a combination of structured data elements and natural language 
      processing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified 238,059 unique patients who met the 
      eligibility criteria for one or more trials. The risk of housing instability 
      decreased in both arms over the three years after initiating a trial but was 
      lower among SSVF enrollees, with a risk difference of -12.9% (95% confidence band 
      -14.6%, -11.2%) on Day 120 and an attenuated difference of -2.4% (-4.0%, -0.7%) 
      on Day 1095. CONCLUSIONS: SSVF is one of the largest rapid rehousing and 
      homelessness prevention programs in the nation. We found that SSVF improves 
      housing outcomes over the three years following enrollment, but the effect 
      reduces over time. These findings can inform policy and program design for 
      improving housing outcomes for homeless-experienced individuals.

TI  - Cohort-Based Evaluation of the Risk of Low Back Pain After Total Hip 
      Arthroplasty: A Long-Term Study.
LID - 10.3390/life15020248 [doi]
LID - 248
AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is a potential complication after total hip arthroplasty 
      (THA). However, some studies suggest that THA not only alleviates joint pain but 
      also resolves LBP in up to 88.2% of patients. Most of these observations are 
      limited to short-term follow-ups. This study investigates the long-term 
      relationship between THA and LBP, challenging the notion that THA resolves LBP. A 
      retrospective review was conducted on 236 patients who underwent THA (2010-2020). 
      Multiple statistical models were applied, including unadjusted unmatched, 
      adjusted unmatched, adjusted matched, and target trial emulation with 7887 
      subjects, to evaluate LBP incidence. Of the 236 patients, 119 developed 
      postoperative LBP. The unadjusted unmatched analysis showed a relative risk (RR) 
      of 2.23 (95%CI: 1.5-3.2). Adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and 
      recruitment period reduced the RR to 1.64 (95%CI: 1.0-2.6). The adjusted matched 
      analysis showed an RR of 1.09 (95%CI: 0.4-3.0), while the target trial emulation 
      simulated an RR of 1.03 (95%CI: 0.7-1.8), indicating no significant differences. 
      Despite an apparent initial association, adjusted analyses do not support a 
      significant long-term relationship between THA and LBP. No reduction in 
      postoperative LBP incidence was observed, suggesting THA is safe regarding LBP 
      risk but lacks a curative effect. Rigorous confounding adjustment is essential in 
      retrospective studies.

TI  - Initiation of Hearing Aids Use and Incident Dementia Among Mid-to-late Life 
      Adults: The Health and Retirement Study 2010-2018.
PG  - 172-179
LID - 10.1177/08919887241302107 [doi]
AB  - Background and ObjectivesHearing aids may reduce the risk of dementia among 
      individuals with hearing loss. However, no evidence is available from randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of hearing aids use in reducing 
      incident dementia. Using target trial emulation, we leveraged an existing 
      longitudinal cohort study to estimate the association between hearing aids 
      initiation and risk of dementia.Research Design and MethodsThe Health and 
      Retirement Study was used to emulate target trials among non-institutionalized 
      participants aged ≥50 years with self-reported hearing loss, without dementia at 
      baseline, and without use of hearing aids in the previous 2 years. 
      Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted to estimate the risk of dementia 
      associated with hearing aids initiation vs controls who did not initiate hearing 
      aids. Pooled logistic regression models with inverse-probability of treatment and 
      censoring weights were applied to estimate risk ratios, and 95% confidence 
      intervals were calculated using 1000 sets of bootstrapping.ResultsAmong 2314 
      participants (328 in the intervention group and 1986 in the control group; 
      average age: 72.3 ± 9.7 years, 49% women, and 81% White), after 8 years of 
      follow-up, risk of dementia was significantly lower among individuals who 
      initiated hearing aids (risk difference (RD): -0.05, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI): -0.08, -0.01). A lower risk was observed particularly among adults aged 
      50-74 years, men, and individuals with cardiovascular disease.Discussion and 
      ImplicationsHearing aids use was associated with a significant reduction of 
      incident dementia. Future interventional studies are needed to further assess the 
      effectiveness of hearing aids in preventing dementia.

TI  - Cancer publications using real-world data from the Taiwan National Health 
      Insurance Research Database: Conceptual framework and bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 398-409
LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000001227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bibliometric analysis often overlooks study-based components such as 
      study aims, design, and statistical methods. In this study, we propose a 
      conceptual framework incorporating these study-based components with 
      disease-based components for the bibliometric analysis of cancer articles using 
      real-world data. This framework is a significant step forward in cancer research. 
      We then investigated the distribution and temporal trends of these components for 
      cancer articles using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database 
      (NHIRD) published from 2006 to 2022. METHODS: Study- and disease-based components 
      were extracted and cross-validated. The distribution and temporal trends of these 
      components were then presented. RESULTS: We analyzed 1232 articles and found a 
      noticeable increase in the annual publication count from 2011 onward. This upward 
      trend signified the growing momentum in cancer research. Cancer risk factors were 
      the most studied (52%), followed by cancer outcomes (36%) and 
      incidence/prevalence (3%). Among the publications on risk factors and outcomes, 
      most were cohort studies (85%), followed by case-control studies (10.7%). In both 
      study designs, the use of the propensity score method increased steadily from 
      2.4% in 2011 to 40% in 2022. The most frequently studied cancer site was "all 
      cancers or multiple cancers" (25.6%), followed by breast (9.6%), hepatobiliary 
      (9.2%), and colorectal cancers (8.8%). Among the top 10 cited articles, the first 
      and fourth focused on whether suppressing hepatitis B viral load with nucleoside 
      analogs could reduce hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence and incidence in chronic 
      hepatitis B patients. The remaining eight examined the association between 
      medications and cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Beyond citation metrics, our research 
      underscores the importance of considering study-based and disease-based 
      components in bibliometric analysis. These components form the foundation of the 
      real-world data cancer research framework and have practical implications for 
      diseases beyond cancers, providing a broader perspective for researchers and 
      practitioners.

TI  - Effect of transabdominal versus transvaginal cerclage on preterm birth and 
      neonatal outcomes among patients with a history of cervical insufficiency.
LID - S0002-9378(25)00427-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2025.06.049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2020 Multicentre Abdominal vs Vaginal Randomised Intervention of 
      Cerclage trial found that transabdominal cerclage placed via open laparotomy 
      reduces the risk of spontaneous preterm birth before 32 weeks relative to 
      transvaginal cerclage in a very high-risk obstetric population. It is not known 
      whether the results of the trial generalize to obstetric populations with fewer 
      risk factors, on average, for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth, or to patients 
      without history of failed transvaginal cerclage (an inclusion criterium in the 
      trial). OBJECTIVE: 1) To estimate the effect of transabdominal cerclage vs 
      transvaginal cerclage on early preterm delivery (<34 weeks) among patients with 
      history of cervical insufficiency at a quaternary care center; 2) to estimate the 
      effect within a subgroup of patients without history of failed transvaginal 
      cerclage; and 3) to describe associated complications of placement and delivery 
      and neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We identified a cohort of adult singleton 
      pregnancies who received history-indicated cerclage at a quaternary care center 
      in the United States. The cohort consisted of patients with a history of ≥1 
      spontaneous deliveries (birth or fetal loss) <28 weeks and patients with a 
      history of failed transvaginal cerclage, defined as ≥1 spontaneous preterm 
      deliveries <34 weeks with cervical cerclage in situ. All eligible patients who 
      received transabdominal cerclage were compared to a sample of eligible patients 
      who received transvaginal cerclage. We performed survival analysis with inverse 
      probability weights to adjust for potential sources of bias. Effects were 
      estimated as risk difference, risk ratio, and 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup 
      analyses were performed among patients without a history of failed transvaginal 
      cerclage. The risks of surgical, delivery, and neonatal outcomes were described. 
      RESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight patients were included, of whom 87 received 
      transabdominal cerclage (99% laparoscopic) and 101 received transvaginal 
      cerclage. Twenty-six patients (30%) with transabdominal cerclage had no history 
      of failed transvaginal cerclage, the majority of whom had additional clinical 
      reasons why transabdominal cerclage was offered. After adjusting for confounding, 
      the adjusted risk of early preterm delivery was 5.5% in the transabdominal group 
      (95% confidence interval, 2.0%, 9.4%) and 18.7% in the transvaginal group (95% 
      confidence interval, 6.8%, 31.4%), risk difference = -13.1% (95% confidence 
      interval, -26.6%, -0.5%), and risk ratio = 0.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.10, 
      0.94). Among patients without history of failed transvaginal cerclage (N = 104 
      total, N = 26 in transabdominal group), the risk difference was -12.6% (-21.6%, 
      -4.1%). Risks of placement and delivery complications were comparable across 
      groups but included a few serious uterine complications in the transabdominal 
      cerclage group. Neonatal intensive care unit admission occurred in 35% and 23% of 
      neonates in the transabdominal and transvaginal groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Among women with history of ≥1 preterm deliveries <28 weeks or failed 
      transvaginal cerclage <34 weeks, transabdominal cerclage reduced the risk of 
      preterm delivery <34 weeks compared to transvaginal cerclage, consistent with the 
      Multicentre Abdominal vs Vaginal Randomised Intervention of Cerclage trial 
      findings. Conclusions about efficacy among patients without history of failed 
      transvaginal cerclage are limited by small sample size. Further research is 
      necessary to understand whether the benefits of transabdominal cerclage in 
      subgroups of patients outweigh risks of abdominal surgery and cesarean delivery.

TI  - Optimizing protocols for the 919 strain-based bovine ephemeral fever virus 
      vaccine (Ultravac®, Zoetis™): Evaluation of dose-dependent effectiveness and 
      long-term immunity.
PG  - 126531
LID - S0264-410X(24)01213-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.126531 [doi]
AB  - Bovine Ephemeral Fever (BEF) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) that 
      presents a significant challenge to the cattle industry due to its economic 
      impact, primarily through the loss of milk production in dairy cows. Vaccination 
      is the predominant strategy for managing the disease. We recently showed a 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 60 % of a vaccine based on the Australian 919 BEFV 
      isolate, with a natural challenge occurring shortly after the administration of 
      the second dose of the vaccine. Still, there is a lack of data regarding the 
      duration of protective immunity after vaccination and its potential enhancement 
      after the administration of three and four vaccine doses. To answer these 
      questions we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 850 cows (7 herds), 
      analyzing the influence of different vaccination regimens on VE and a serosurvey 
      of 71 cows to test the longevity of BEFV-specific serum-neutralizing antibodies 
      (SNAb). We adopted a quantitative methodology for BEF diagnosis with the use of 
      commercially validated precision dairy monitoring technologies for milk reduction 
      identification. Survival analysis was used to analyze the vaccine dose 
      effectiveness. A Cox regression mixed-effect model (COXME) was fitted to the 
      data. The analysis demonstrated the following VE compared to zero vaccine doses: 
      82 % (p-value<0.001) for four doses, 66 % (p-value<0.026) for three doses and 
      39 % (p-value = 0.3) for two doses. Corroborating with the VE results, the 
      four-dose regimen exhibited the highest geometric mean titer (GMT) value (4.45, 
      CI(95%) = 3.99, 4.91), followed by the three-dose regimen (3.53, 
      CI(95%) = 3.08,3.98), and the two-dose regimen (2.17, CI(95%) = 1.77,2.57). In 
      light of these findings, we recommend vaccinating calves as early as four to six 
      months old with two doses spaced one month apart, followed by a third and even 
      fourth dose administered between six to 12 months later, ideally close to the 
      onset of the high-risk season.

TI  - Real-World Health and Economic Effects of a Large-Scale Outpatient Screening and 
      Continuing Care Programme for Early Detection and Care of Microvascular 
      Complications in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Implemented in Routine Care Across 
      Germany: A Quasi-Experimental Study Using Health Insurance Claims Data.
LID - 10.1007/s40258-025-00978-5 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to analyse the real-world health and economic 
      effect of an outpatient screening and continuing-care programme for early 
      detection and care of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 
      diabetes (T2D) delivered through a selective contract between a large statutory 
      health insurance company and ambulatory care physicians in the German health care 
      system. METHODS: Building on methods of target trial emulation and programme 
      impact evaluation, we used a quasi-experimental approach and health insurance 
      claims data from 790,375 patients with T2D over a time horizon of 5.75 years. We 
      applied a two-stage matching approach in which we exploited the staggered 
      implementation of the selective contract across federal states in Germany to 
      control for selection bias at the physician level and used propensity scores to 
      control for selection bias at the patient level, where we considered 
      socio-demographic, health consciousness-related, care-related, and 
      comorbidity-related potential confounders in the matching process. RESULTS: 
      Within a matched sample of 16,490 patients, over 1 year, enrolment into the 
      programme increased the number of visits to primary care physicians (relative 
      risk [RR]: 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.10), increased the 
      frequency of prescriptions for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 
      (RR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.12, 1.50) and for statins (RR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.03, 1.13) and 
      decreased the risk of hospitalisations (RR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.84, 0.92). Outpatient 
      costs in the enrolled patients were on average 14% (cost ratio: 1.14, 95% CI 
      1.09, 1.20) or €194.4 higher, but overall, the programme was budget neutral over 
      a time horizon of 1 year. CONCLUSION: Investing in secondary prevention to detect 
      and manage the early stages of microvascular complications is likely a 
      cost-effective or cost-saving approach to improve health in patients with T2D.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a framework for conducting rigorous nonrandomized studies 
      of interventions in fertility treatment research, addressing their role as 
      complements to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in evaluating treatment 
      outcomes. DESIGN: Multidisciplinary expert consensus on best practices for 
      nonrandomized studies of interventions, informed by advancements in novel 
      methodologies, including causal inference. SUBJECTS: Patients undergoing assisted 
      reproductive technologies (ARTs) procedures, such as ovarian stimulation, 
      laboratory techniques, and embryo transfer. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Guidance on methodological rigor, transparency, and relevance in 
      nonrandomized studies of interventions study design and analysis. RESULTS: 
      Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for determining the efficacy 
      and safety of fertility treatment/ART interventions but can face logistical, 
      practical, and sometimes ethical challenges. Nonrandomized studies of 
      interventions, when conducted with high methodological rigor, complement RCTs by 
      offering insights into real-world clinical practices and diverse patient 
      populations. Key limitations of nonrandomized studies of interventions include 
      susceptibility to confounding and selection bias, which require meticulous study 
      design and advanced analytical techniques to address. Recent innovations, such as 
      target trial emulation studies, have enhanced the validity of causal inferences 
      based on nonrandomized studies of interventions. This article outlines 7 
      recommendations to improve the credibility of nonrandomized studies of 
      interventions in ART research: clearly define research questions with precise 
      estimands; design nonrandomized studies of interventions as emulated trials; use 
      directed acyclic graphs to clarify causal assumptions; preregister study 
      protocols; separate data analysis from study planning; incorporate negative 
      controls to detect biases; and use appropriate analytical methods to account for 
      confounding and selection bias. CONCLUSION: Integrating evidence from RCTs and 
      well-conducted nonrandomized studies of interventions enhances clinical decision 
      making in fertility treatment research. By adhering to these recommendations, 
      researchers can improve the quality, transparency, and impact of nonrandomized 
      studies of interventions, ultimately fostering robust, evidence-based clinical 
      practices in fertility treatment/ART.

TI  - Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury and its clinical and economic impact: a 
      retrospective cohort study using two Japanese healthcare databases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury 
      (AKI) were methodologically limited. We herein investigated the AKI incidence, 
      clinical outcomes, and economic impact of this condition on Japan's aging 
      population using a robust, methodological approach to analyze information from 
      two, large-scale, Japanese, healthcare databases. METHODS: This retrospective 
      cohort study analyzed data on 2007 and 2607 patients aged ≥18 years and 
      registered with the Medical Data Vision (MDV) database and the JMDC, Inc. 
      database, respectively, who received vancomycin ≥4 days. Target trial emulation 
      was employed with 1:1 propensity score matching to compare the outcomes of 
      patients with and without AKI. The primary outcomes included 30-day in-hospital 
      mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and direct medical costs. The KDIGO 
      guidelines' definition of AKI was used. RESULTS: AKI occurred in 19.4 % (MDV) and 
      14.9 % (JMDC) of the cohorts with the median onset being five days. After 
      propensity score matching (386 and 387 pairs for MDV and JMDC, respectively), the 
      AKI group demonstrated significantly higher 30-day in-hospital mortality (odds 
      ratio: 3.82 [95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.52-5.79] for MDV; 4.36 [95 % CI: 
      2.89-6.57] for JMDC; both P < .001), prolonged LOS (hazard ratio: 1.45 [95 % CI: 
      1.22-1.72] for MDV; 1.79 [95 % CI: 1.35-2.37] for JMDC; both P < .001), and 
      higher daily direct medical costs per patient (cost ratio: 1.39 [95 % CI: 
      1.19-1.62] for MDV; 1.33 [95 % CI: 1.18-1.50] for JMDC; both P < .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin-associated AKI significantly increased mortality, 
      prolonged hospitalization, and elevated healthcare costs. These findings can 
      provide further impetus to effective vancomycin stewardship.

TI  - The effect of achieving serological remission on subsequent risk of relapse, 
      end-stage renal disease and mortality in ANCA-associated vasculitis: a target 
      trial emulation study.
PG  - 1438-1445
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-222439 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of achieving a negative postinduction 
      antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCA) assay on the risk of relapse, end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) and death in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). METHODS: We 
      emulated a target trial using observational data from the Mass General Brigham 
      AAV cohort comparing patients who achieved versus did not achieve serological 
      remission (negative ANCA assay) within 180 days of induction. Outcomes were 
      relapse, ESRD or death within 5 years, obtained from medical records, the US 
      Renal Data System and the National Death Index. We placed a 'clone' of each 
      patient in both trial arms, censored those deviating from their assigned protocol 
      and weighted each by the inverse probability of censoring. Outcomes were assessed 
      by pooled logistic regression. RESULTS: The study included 506 patients with AAV. 
      The mean age was 61 years (SD 18) and the majority were women (58%), white (87%), 
      myeloperoxidase-ANCA+ (72%) and had renal involvement (68%). Rituximab (59%) or 
      cyclophosphamide (33%) was most often used for induction treatment. Within 5 
      years, 81 (16%) died, 51 (10%) had ESRD and 64 (13%) had relapse. Patients 
      treated to a negative ANCA assay within 180 days had HR 0.55 (95% CI 0.38 to 
      0.81) for relapse and HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.25) for the composite of ESRD or 
      death within 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this emulated target trial from a large AAV 
      cohort, achieving serological remission within 180 days of induction was 
      associated with lower risk of relapse, but no statistically significant 
      difference in ESRD or mortality outcomes.

TI  - Association of a Shortened Duration of Adjuvant Chemotherapy With Overall 
      Survival Among Individuals With Stage III Colon Cancer.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Several real-world oncology studies have produced findings that 
      contradict those from randomized clinical trials. Such disparities may be 
      associated with methodological shortcomings. OBJECTIVE: To examine the 
      association between a shortened duration of adjuvant chemotherapy among 
      individuals with stage III colon cancer using real-world data. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study included individuals 
      diagnosed with stage III colon cancer between January 2004 and December 2015 who 
      initiated adjuvant chemotherapy at oncology clinics within the province of 
      Alberta, Canada. Patients were identified through record linkage of various 
      administrative databases and were followed up until September 2017. Eligibility 
      criteria were modeled after those used in the International Duration Evaluation 
      of Adjuvant (IDEA) trial. A target trial emulation and naive observational 
      analysis were conducted. Results from both cohorts were benchmarked against 
      findings from the IDEA trial. Data analysis was conducted from March to December 
      2020. EXPOSURE: A shortened duration of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus 
      oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) chemotherapy, 
      defined as 3 to 5 months of treatment vs 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Overall survival assessed via vital statistics. The per-protocol hazard ratio 
      (HR) was estimated using a weighted pooled logistic regression model. Subgroup 
      analyses were conducted by treatment regimen (ie, FOLFOX vs CAPOX) and cancer 
      stage (ie, T1-3 and N1 vs T4 or N2). RESULTS: From an initial cohort of 3086 
      patients, 485 (16%) were eligible for inclusion in the target trial analysis. The 
      median age was 59 years (range, 19-81 years), and 230 (47%) were women. The 
      maximum follow-up was 11.6 years. Median overall survival was not reached. A 
      total of 90 patients (19%) died. The 5-year Kaplan Meier overall survival 
      estimate was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.84). Estimates from the trial emulation were 
      similar to those from the IDEA trial. For example, a shortened duration of 
      adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with overall survival among patients 
      prescribed CAPOX in the IDEA trial (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08) or in the trial 
      emulation (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.43-2.14). In contrast, the naive observational 
      analysis suggested that a shortened duration of CAPOX was significantly 
      associated with worse survival (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.04-10.65). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this study, the explicit emulation of a target trial better 
      approximated results from an analogous well-conducted randomized clinical trial.

TI  - Energy management education for persons living with long COVID-related fatigue 
      (EMERGE): protocol of a two-parallel arms target trial emulation study in a 
      multicentre outpatient intervention setting with an online control group 
      register.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Energy management education (EME) is a manualised, evidence-based 
      self-management education programme developed and delivered by occupational 
      therapists for persons living with chronic disease-related fatigue. Studies have 
      shown that EME can positively affect self-efficacy, fatigue impact and quality of 
      life in persons with chronic conditions, while data on persons with long COVID 
      are lacking.The primary aim is to evaluate if adding EME to the standard care 
      improves outcomes in persons with long COVID-related fatigue. The secondary aim 
      is to explore the energy management behavioural strategies applied in daily 
      routines and investigate the influencing factors of implementing behavioural 
      changes. The third aim is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of EME. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using observational data, we will emulate a prospective 
      two-parallel arms target trial to assess whether adding EME to the standard care 
      is associated with improved outcomes in patients with long COVID-related fatigue. 
      The estimated sample size to detect a post-intervention difference of 1.5 points 
      in self-efficacy to implement energy conservation strategies with 90% power (0.05 
      alpha) is 122 people (1:1 ratio).Persons with long COVID-related fatigue who 
      follow EME as part of their standard care will be recruited and included in the 
      experimental group (EG), while potential participants for the control group (CG) 
      will be recruited from a register and prospectively matched to a participant in 
      the EG by applying the propensity score technique. The 'standard of care' of the 
      CG will include any intervention, except occupational therapy-based EME in peer 
      groups. The causal contrast of interest will be the per-protocol effect. Four 
      self-reported questionnaires (fatigue impact, self-efficacy in performing energy 
      management strategies, competency in performing daily activities, health-related 
      quality of life) will be administered at baseline (T0; week 0), after lesson 7 
      (T1; week 6), post-intervention (T2; week 14) and follow-up (T3, week 24). Our 
      main assessment will be at T2. Disease-related and productivity cost data will be 
      collected, and a cost-effectiveness profile of the EME intervention will be 
      compared with standard care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been 
      obtained from the competent Swiss ethics commission.Findings will be reported (1) 
      to the study participants; (2) to patient organisations and hospitals supporting 
      EMERGE; (3) to funding bodies; (4) to the national and international occupational 
      therapy community and healthcare policy; (5) will be presented at local, 
      national, and international conferences and (6) will be disseminated by 
      peer-review publications.

TI  - Benefit and risk of oral anticoagulant initiation strategies in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation and cancer: a target trial emulation using the SEER-Medicare 
      database.
PG  - 638-649
LID - 10.1007/s11239-024-02958-3 [doi]
AB  - Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation 
      (AFib) having CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 2. However, the benefits of OAC initiation 
      in patients with AFib and cancer at different levels of CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc is 
      unknown. We included patients with new AFib diagnosis and a record of cancer 
      (breast, prostate, or lung) from the 2012-2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
      End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (n = 39,915). Risks of stroke and bleeding 
      were compared between 5 treatment strategies: (1) initiated OAC when 
      CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 1 (n = 6008), (2) CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 2 (n = 8694), (3) 
      CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 4 (n = 20,286), (4) CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 6 (n = 30,944), and (5) 
      never initiated OAC (reference group, n = 33,907). Confounders were adjusted 
      using inverse probability weighting through cloning-censoring-weighting approach. 
      Weighted pooled logistic regressions were used to estimate treatment effect 
      [hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CIs)]. We found that only 
      patients who initiated OACs at CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 6 had lower risk of stroke 
      compared without OAC initiation (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.75). All 4 active 
      treatment strategies had reduced risk of bleeding compared to non-initiators, 
      with OAC initiation at CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 6 being the most beneficial strategy 
      (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.44-0.55). In patients with lung cancer or 
      regional/metastatic cancer, OAC initiation at any CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc level 
      increased risk of stroke and did not reduce risk of bleeding (except for Regimen 
      4). In conclusion, among cancer patients with new AFib diagnosis, OAC initiation 
      at higher risk of stroke (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 6) is more beneficial in 
      preventing ischemic stroke and bleeding. Patients with advanced cancer or low 
      life-expectancy may initiate OACs when CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 6.

      emulation stratified by predicted organ dysfunction trajectory.

LID - 10.1101/2024.03.07.24303926 [doi]
AB  - Corticosteroids decrease the duration of organ dysfunction in a range of 
      infectious critical illnesses, but their risk and benefit are not fully defined 
      using this construct. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to evaluate the 
      association between usage of corticosteroids and mortality of patients with 
      infectious critical illness by emulating a target trial framework. The study 
      employed a novel stratification method with predictive machine learning (ML) 
      subphenotyping based on organ dysfunction trajectory. Our analysis revealed that 
      corticosteroids' effectiveness varied depending on the stratification method. The 
      ML-based approach identified four distinct subphenotypes, two of which had a 
      large enough sample size in our patient cohorts for further evaluation: "Rapidly 
      Improving" (RI) and "Rapidly Worsening," (RW) which showed divergent responses to 
      corticosteroid treatment. Specifically, the RW group either benefited or were not 
      harmed from corticosteroids, whereas the RI group appeared to derive harm. In the 
      development cohort, which comprised of a combination of patients from the eICU 
      and MIMIC-IV datasets, hazard ratio estimates for the primary outcome, 28-day 
      mortality, in the RW group was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.96 - 1.04) whereas for the RW 
      group, it was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.28 - 1.54). For the validation cohort, which 
      comprised of patients from the Critical carE Database for Advanced Research, 
      estimates for 28-day mortality for the RW and RI groups were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.05 - 
      1.46) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.14 - 1.59), respectively. For secondary outcomes, the 
      RW group had a shorter time to ICU discharge and time to cessation of mechanical 
      ventilation with corticosteroid treatment, where the RI group again demonstrated 
      harm. The findings support matching treatment strategies to empirically observed 
      pathobiology and offer a more nuanced understanding of corticosteroid utility. 
      Our results have implications for the design and interpretation of both 
      observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), suggesting the 
      need for stratification methods that account for the differential response to 
      standard of care.

TI  - Lower risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with GLP-1RAs in type 2 
      diabetes: A nationwide cohort study using target trial emulation framework.
PG  - 357-368
LID - 10.1111/joim.13751 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the association of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) with the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) versus 
      long-acting insulins (LAIs), which are the two commonly prescribed injectable 
      glucose-lowering agents (GLAs) for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) after the 
      failure of multiple oral GLAs. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using the 
      nationwide data of a Taiwanese cohort with T2D. Incident new users of GLP-1RAs 
      and LAIs during 2013-2018 were identified, and propensity score (PS) matching was 
      applied to ensure between-group comparability in baseline patient 
      characteristics. The primary outcome was the composite liver disease including 
      cirrhosis or HCC. Each patient was followed until the occurrence of a study 
      outcome, death, or the end of 2019, whichever came first. Subdistribution hazard 
      models were employed to assess the treatment-outcome association. Sensitivity 
      (e.g., stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis, 
      time-dependent analysis), E-value, and negative control outcome analyses were 
      performed to examine the robustness of study findings. RESULTS: We included 7171 
      PS-matched pairs of GLP-1RA and LAI users with no significant between-group 
      differences at baseline. Compared with LAIs, the use of GLP-1RAs was associated 
      with significantly reduced risks of composite liver disease (subdistribution 
      hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.56 [0.42-0.76]), cirrhosis (0.59 
      [0.43-0.81]), and HCC (0.47 [0.24-0.93]). Results were consistent across 
      sensitivity analyses and among patients with different baseline characteristics. 
      CONCLUSION: Among T2D patients who require injectable GLAs, the use of GLP-1RAs 
      versus LAIs was associated with lower risks of cirrhosis and HCC.

TI  - Tolerability and comparative effectiveness of TNF, IL-17 and IL-23(p19) 
      inhibitors in psoriatic arthritis: a target trial emulation study.
PG  - 1543-1551
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/kead488 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the tolerability and effectiveness of two different 
      classes of biological DMARDs [IL-17 and IL-23(p19) inhibitors, IL-17i and 
      IL-23(p19)i] relative to TNF inhibitors (TNFi) regarding the drug survival rates 
      and treatment outcomes in patients with PsA. METHODS: We emulated a target trial 
      on comparative effectiveness using observational data from a prospective cohort 
      study based on the Parker Institute's PsA cohort (the PIPA cohort). All patients 
      underwent interview and a clinical examination programme at baseline and at 
      follow-up visits at 4 and 12 months. The primary endpoint, drug survival, was 
      assessed up to 12 months from baseline. We estimated hazard ratios from 
      proportional hazards model and used propensity score adjustment in an attempt to 
      deconfound and emulate a random treatment assignment. RESULTS: We included a 
      total of 109 patients in the intention-to-monitor population at baseline 
      initiating either TNFi (75 patients), IL-17i (26 patients) or IL-23(19)i (8 
      patients). Hazard ratios in the propensity adjusted model comparing IL-17i and 
      IL-23(p19)i with TNFi were 1.36 (95% CI 0.59-3.14) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.10-3.24), 
      respectively. TNFi and IL-17i had comparable effects regarding response rates and 
      changes in clinical outcomes after 12 months, whereas IL-23(p19)i tended to 
      perform better overall. CONCLUSION: No decisive differences between drugs were 
      observed at group level regarding drug survival and clinical outcomes after 
      12 months. TNFi, IL-17i and IL-23(p19)i may all be considered equally effective 
      in the treatment of patients with PsA, advocating for investigating more in 
      personalized treatment strategies.

PG  - 622-632
LID - 10.7326/M20-6739 [doi]
LID - M20-6739
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypercoagulability may be a key mechanism of death in patients with 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding in critically ill patients with 
      COVID-19 and examine the observational effect of early therapeutic 
      anticoagulation on survival. DESIGN: In a multicenter cohort study of 3239 
      critically ill adults with COVID-19, the incidence of VTE and major bleeding 
      within 14 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission was evaluated. A target 
      trial emulation in which patients were categorized according to receipt or no 
      receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation in the first 2 days of ICU admission was 
      done to examine the observational effect of early therapeutic anticoagulation on 
      survival. A Cox model with inverse probability weighting to adjust for 
      confounding was used. SETTING: 67 hospitals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Adults with COVID-19 admitted to a participating ICU. MEASUREMENTS: Time to 
      death, censored at hospital discharge, or date of last follow-up. RESULTS: Among 
      the 3239 patients included, the median age was 61 years (interquartile range, 53 
      to 71 years), and 2088 (64.5%) were men. A total of 204 patients (6.3%) developed 
      VTE, and 90 patients (2.8%) developed a major bleeding event. Independent 
      predictors of VTE were male sex and higher D-dimer level on ICU admission. Among 
      the 2809 patients included in the target trial emulation, 384 (11.9%) received 
      early therapeutic anticoagulation. In the primary analysis, during a median 
      follow-up of 27 days, patients who received early therapeutic anticoagulation had 
      a similar risk for death as those who did not (hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.92 
      to 1.35]). LIMITATION: Observational design. CONCLUSION: Among critically ill 
      adults with COVID-19, early therapeutic anticoagulation did not affect survival 
      in the target trial emulation. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

TI  - Associations of semaglutide with first-time diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes: Target trial emulation using nationwide real-world 
      data in the US.
PG  - 8661-8672
LID - 10.1002/alz.14313 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that semaglutide, a 
      glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) and obesity, protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. 
      However, real-world evidence for its ability to protect against Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) is lacking. METHODS: We conducted emulation target trials based on a 
      nationwide database of electronic health records (EHRs) of 116 million US 
      patients. Seven target trials were emulated among 1,094,761 eligible patients 
      with T2DM who had no prior AD diagnosis by comparing semaglutide with seven other 
      antidiabetic medications. First-ever diagnosis of AD occurred within a 3-year 
      follow-up period and was examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier 
      survival analyses. RESULTS: Semaglutide was associated with significantly reduced 
      risk for first-time AD diagnosis, most strongly compared with insulin (hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.33 [95% CI: 0.21 to 0.51]) and most weakly compared with other 
      GLP-1RAs (HR, 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37 to 0.95]). Similar results were seen across 
      obesity status, gender, and age groups. DISCUSSION: These findings support 
      further studies to assess semaglutide's potential in preventing AD. HIGHLIGHTS: 
      Semaglutide was associated with 40% to 70% reduced risks of first-time AD 
      diagnosis in T2DM patients compared to other antidiabetic medications, including 
      other GLP-1RAs. Semaglutide was associated with significantly lower AD-related 
      medication prescriptions. Similar reductions were seen across obesity status, 
      gender, and age groups. Our findings provide real-world evidence supporting the 
      potential clinical benefits of semaglutide in mitigating AD initiation and 
      development in patients with T2DM. These findings support further clinical trials 
      to assess semaglutide's potential in delaying or preventing AD.

TI  - Injurious Fall Risk Differences Among Older Adults With First-Line Depression 
      Treatments.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: One-third of older adults in the US have depression, often treated 
      with psychotherapy and antidepressants. Previous studies suggesting an increased 
      risk of falls and related injuries (FRI) associated with antidepressant use may 
      be affected by confounding by indication or immortal time bias. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the association between FRI risk and first-line treatments in older 
      adults with depression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used 
      a target trial emulation framework with a cloning-censoring-weighting approach 
      with Medicare claims data from 2016 to 2019. Participants included 
      fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed 
      depression. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. 
      EXPOSURES: First-line depression treatments including psychotherapy, sertraline, 
      escitalopram, citalopram, mirtazapine, duloxetine, trazodone, fluoxetine, 
      bupropion, paroxetine, and venlafaxine. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: One-year FRI 
      rate, restricted mean survival time (RMST), and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 
      95% CI. RESULTS: Among 101 953 eligible beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 76 [8] 
      years), 63 344 (62.1%) were female, 7404 (7.3%) were Black individuals, and 
      81 856 (80.3%) were White individuals. Compared with the untreated group, 
      psychotherapy use was not associated with FRI risk (aHR, 0.94 [95% CI, 
      0.82-1.17]), while other first-line antidepressants were associated with a 
      decreased FRI risk (aHR ranged from 0.74 [95% CI, 0.59-0.89] for bupropion to 
      0.83 [95% CI, 0.67-0.98] for escitalopram). The FRI incidence ranged from 63 (95% 
      CI, 53-75) per 1000 person-year for those treated with bupropion to 87 (95% CI, 
      83-90) per 1000 person-year for those who were untreated. The RMST ranged from 
      349 (95% CI, 346-350) days for those who were untreated to 353 (95% CI, 350-356) 
      days for those treated with bupropion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort 
      study of older Medicare beneficiaries with depression, first-line antidepressants 
      were associated with a decreased FRI risk compared with untreated individuals. 
      These findings provide valuable insights into their safety profiles, aiding 
      clinicians in their consideration for treating depression in older adults.

TI  - Effects of moderate/vigorous activity on 3-year body composition changes in 
      postmenopausal women: a target trial emulation.
PG  - 1032-1042
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwae190 [doi]
AB  - Postmenopausal women experience significant changes in body composition, 
      particularly abdominal adipose tissue (AAT) deposition patterns, which influence 
      cardiometabolic risk. Physical activity has demonstrable effects on body 
      composition and overall health; however, there is little evidence for how 
      physical activity influences AAT patterns and body composition in postmenopausal 
      women. We emulated a target trial of physical activity interventions, including 
      the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommendations (≥150 
      minutes/week), on 3-year changes in AAT and body composition. We analyzed data 
      from 4451 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years in the Women's Health Initiative 
      (WHI) with repeated whole body Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans with derived 
      abdominal visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). The mean AAT and 
      body composition measures were estimated with the parametric-g formula. Over 3 
      years, interventions of increasing minutes of moderate activity would result in 
      dose-dependent reductions in AAT, overall body fat and increases in lean soft 
      tissue, with the greatest estimated benefit at the 2018 physical activity 
      guideline recommendations. Compared to no intervention, if all participants had 
      adhered to ≥150 mins/week of moderate physical activity, they would have 16.8 cm2 
      lower VAT (95% CI: -23.1, -10.4), 26.8 cm2 lower SAT (95% CI: -36.3, -17.3), 1.3% 
      lower total body fat (95% CI: -1.8, -0.7), 1.2% higher total lean soft tissue 
      (95% CI: 0.7-1.8), and 2.6 kg lower bodyweight (95% CI, -3.6, -1.5). We saw 
      similar patterns in vigorous-intensity activity interventions. These results 
      suggest that postmenopausal women who adhere to physical activity guideline 
      recommendations would experience beneficial body composition changes over 3 
      years.

TI  - Risks of carpal tunnel syndrome and carpal tunnel release surgery in users of 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonists: A target trial emulation study.
PG  - 101545
LID - S1262-3636(24)00037-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.diabet.2024.101545 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Preclinical studies have shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
      inhibitors (SGLT2is) have a neuroprotective effect. This study compared the risks 
      of carpal tunnel syndrome and carpal tunnel release surgery between new users of 
      SGLT2is and new users of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). 
      METHODS: A retrospective new-user active comparator cohort study with a target 
      trial design was conducted by using the TriNetX platform. Patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus prescribed SGLT2is or GLP-1RAs were identified. Covariates were 
      balanced using propensity score matching to form 2 homogenous treatment groups. 
      Outcomes were the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome and the risk of carpal tunnel 
      release surgery. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were 
      calculated using the TriNetX platform. RESULTS: The crude cohort included 86,188 
      and 100,244 patients in the SGLT2is group and GLP-1RAs group, respectively. After 
      matching, each group included 65,464 patients. The SGLT2is group had an average 
      age of 59.6 years, and 46 % were women. The GLP-1RAs group had an average age of 
      59.5 years, and 45.9 % were women. The incidences of carpal tunnel syndrome (HR: 
      0.928; 95 % CI: 0.869 to 0.991) and carpal tunnel release surgery (HR: 0.840; 95 
      % CI: 0.726 to 0.971) were significantly lower in the SGLT2is group than in the 
      GLP-1RAs group. CONCLUSION: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, SGLT2is 
      seem to decrease the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome and the need for carpal 
      tunnel release surgery. Prospective studies are required to confirm our results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) 
      when spironolactone use is added on to loop diuretic use among patients with 
      heart failure, and to evaluate whether the risk is modified by level of kidney 
      function. METHODS: We identified 17,110 patients with heart failure treated with 
      loop diuretics between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2016 within the 
      Geisinger Health System. We estimated the incidence of hyperkalemia and AKI 
      associated with spironolactone initiation, and used target trial emulation 
      methods to minimize confounding by indication. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up 
      of 134 mo, 3229 of 17,110 patients (18.9%) initiated spironolactone. Incidence 
      rates of hyperkalemia and AKI in patients using spironolactone with a loop 
      diuretic were 2.9 and 10.1 events per 1000 person-months, respectively. In 
      propensity score-matched analyses, spironolactone initiation was associated with 
      higher hyperkalemia and AKI risk compared with loop alone (hazard ratio, 1.69; 
      95% CI, 1.35 to 2.10; P<.001, and hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.26; 
      P=.04, respectively). There were no differences in the relative risk of either 
      outcome associated with spironolactone by level of kidney function. CONCLUSION: 
      The addition of spironolactone to loop diuretics in patients with heart failure 
      was associated with higher risk of hyperkalemia and AKI; these risks must be 
      weighed against the potential benefits of spironolactone.

TI  - Explaining the Relationships Between Age, Endocrine Therapy Persistence, and Risk 
      of Recurrence in Hormone Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer: A Nationwide 
      Cohort Study.
PG  - 1863-1874
LID - 10.1200/JCO.24.01131 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Young age is associated with increased risk of recurrence in hormone 
      receptor (HR)-positive early-stage breast cancer (eBC). Lack of adherence to 
      endocrine therapy (ET) is a potential reason for the lower survival proportions 
      observed in younger patients, but the survival benefits of improving adherence to 
      ET in young patients remain unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the 
      French National Health Data System and target trial emulation methods, we 
      considered three sustained ET persistence strategies (allowing treatment gaps of 
      no more than 30, 90, or 180 continuous days) and estimated the 5-year 
      disease-free survival (DFS) benefit of sustained ET persistence compared with 
      observed ET persistence. RESULTS: A total of 121,601 patients with HR-positive 
      eBC were included in the analyses, of whom 29.8% was younger than 50 years at 
      diagnosis. Younger patients had lower DFS and were more likely to discontinue ET 
      than older patients. In patients 34 years and younger, strict ET persistence 
      (≤30-day gaps) improved 5-year DFS proportions from 74.5% to 78.8% (4.3 
      percentage points [95% CI, 2.6 to 7.2]) compared with observed persistence. ET 
      persistence strategies allowing for ≤90-day and ≤180-day gaps reduced the 5-year 
      DFS benefit in patients 34 years and younger to 1.3 (95% CI, 0.2 to 3.7) and 1.0 
      (95% CI, -0.2 to 3.4) percentage points, respectively. By contrast, DFS benefits 
      of improved ET persistence in patients after 50 years old did not exceed 1.9 
      percentage points, compared with observed persistence, regardless of the 
      persistence definition. CONCLUSION: The survival benefit that could be achieved 
      with strict ET persistence in women 34 years and younger with HR-positive eBC 
      highlights the need for tailored strategies to improve ET persistence in this 
      population.

TI  - Comparative Bleeding Risk in Older Patients With HIV and Atrial Fibrillation 
      Receiving Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 431-439
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.8335 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: People living with HIV and atrial fibrillation (AF) often receive 
      anticoagulation that may interact with their antiretroviral therapy (ART). No 
      studies exist comparing the safety of oral anticoagulants in this population. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the bleeding risks among warfarin, rivaroxaban, and 
      apixaban users in a national US cohort with AF and HIV. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: A new-user, active-comparator, propensity score overlap-weighted 
      cohort study using the target trial emulation framework including Medicare claims 
      database data (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2020) was carried out. The 
      analysis was conducted from July 2023 to April 2024. EXPOSURE: New initiators of 
      warfarin vs apixaban, rivaroxaban vs apixaban, and rivaroxaban vs warfarin aged 
      50 years or older with nonvalvular AF and HIV. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome was hospitalization for major bleeding. Secondary outcomes 
      included hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding, ischemic stroke, and 
      all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 2683 individuals (mean [SD] age, 66.22 
      [8.97] years; 580 female individuals [21.6%]) in the warfarin vs apixaban cohort, 
      2176 (mean [SD] age, 66.61 [8.87] years; 455 female individuals [20.9%]) in the 
      rivaroxaban vs apixaban cohort, and 1787 (mean age, 65.47 years; 377 female 
      individuals [21.1%]) in the rivaroxaban vs warfarin cohort. After propensity 
      score overlap weighting, warfarin initiation was associated with a higher rate of 
      major bleeding than initiation of apixaban (hazard ratio [HR], 2.60; 95% CI, 
      1.51-4.49), including major gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 
      1.52-5.90). This association was intensified in the 71% of patients taking 
      concurrent ART (major bleeding, HR, 6.68; 95% CI, 2.78-16.02; gastrointestinal 
      bleeding, HR, 5.28; 95% CI, 2.08-13.42). Rivaroxaban vs apixaban was also 
      associated with a higher rate of major bleeding (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18-3.94) and 
      gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.57-7.25), with a stronger 
      association in those using ART (major bleeding, HR, 4.83; 95% CI, 2.11-11.08; 
      gastrointestinal bleeding, HR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.78-12.70). Estimates were similar 
      when comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin. No significant difference was observed 
      in the rate of ischemic stroke or mortality among the 3 oral anticoagulants. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that in patients with HIV and AF, 
      especially those treated with ART, warfarin and rivaroxaban were associated with 
      higher rates of major bleeding compared with apixaban, suggesting a superior 
      safety profile for apixaban in this high-risk population.

      Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used in this nationwide retrospective 
      cohort study. A target trial emulation framework was applied. Patients with T2D 
      with no prior diagnosis of RVO who had newly commenced treatment with SGLT-2i or 
      DPP-4i between May 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, were included. Potential 
      systematic differences in baseline characteristics between the paired groups were 
      controlled using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting. The 
      outcome of interest was incident RVO. The hazard ratio (HR) for SGLT-2i compared 
      with that of DPP-4i was estimated using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Data 
      from 123,567 and 578,665 patients receiving SGLT-2i and DPP-4i, respectively, 
      were analyzed. The incidence of RVO was lower in patients newly receiving SGLT-2i 
      (0.59 events per 1000 person-years) compared to those receiving DPP-4i (0.77 
      events per 1000 person-years) over a mean follow-up of 1.61 years. SGLT-2i users 
      had a significantly lower risk of developing RVO compared with DPP-4i users (HR = 
      0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-0.98). In the individual outcome 
      analysis, SGLT-2i use was significantly associated with a lower risk of branch 
      RVO (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.52-0.96), but not central RVO (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 
      0.57-1.24). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing RVO was lower in patients with 
      T2D receiving SGLT-2i compared with that in those receiving DPP-4i.

TI  - Impact of the geriatric emergency medicine specialist intervention on final 
      emergency department disposition.
PG  - 2017-2026
LID - 10.1111/jgs.18908 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Emergency Medicine Specialist (GEMS) pilot program is 
      an innovative approach that utilizes geriatric-trained advanced practice 
      providers to facilitate geriatric assessments and care planning for older adults 
      in the emergency department (ED). The objective of this study was to explore the 
      effect of GEMS on the use of observation status and final ED disposition. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study under a target trial emulation framework. 
      Geriatric patients (65+ years old) who presented to two ED sites within a large 
      regional healthcare system between December 2020 and December 2022 were included. 
      The primary outcome was final ED disposition (discharge, hospital inpatient 
      admission, or hospital observation admission). Secondary outcomes included ED 
      observation and ED length of stay. Non-GEMS patients were propensity score 
      matched 5:1 to GEMS patients. Doubly robust regression was used to estimate the 
      odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of inpatient admission, discharge, 
      hospital observation admission, ED observation admission, and estimate the mean 
      ED length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 427 of 43,064 total patients (1.0%) 
      received a GEMS intervention during the study period. Our analysis included 2,302 
      geriatric ED patients (410 GEMS, 1,892 non-GEMS) after propensity score matching. 
      Hospital admission rates were 34.1% for GEMS compared to 56.4% for conventional 
      treatment. GEMS patients had decreased odds of inpatient admission (OR: 0.41, 95 
      CI: 0.34-0.51, p < 0.001), increased odds of discharge (OR: 1.19 95 CI: 
      1.00-1.42, p = 0.047), hospital observation admission (OR: 2.97, 95 CI: 
      2.35-3.75, p < 0.001), ED observation admission (OR: 4.84 95 CI: 3.67-6.38, 
      p < 0.001), and had a longer average ED length of stay (170 min, 95 CI: 84.6-256, 
      p < 0.001) compared to non-GEMS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients seen by GEMS 
      during their ED visit were associated with higher rates of hospital discharge and 
      lower rates of hospital admissions.

      Emulation.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine National Cancer Database (NCDB) data to comparatively 
      evaluate overall survival (OS) between patients undergoing transarterial 
      radioembolization (TARE) and those undergoing systemic therapy for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma with major vascular invasion (HCC-MVI). METHODS: One thousand five 
      hundred fourteen patients with HCC-MVI undergoing first-line TARE or systemic 
      therapy were identified from the NCDB. OS was compared using propensity 
      score-matched Cox regression and landmark analysis. Efficacy was also compared 
      within a target trial framework. RESULTS: TARE usage doubled between 2010 and 
      2015. Intervals before treatment were longer for TARE than for systemic therapy 
      (mean [median], 66.5 [60] days vs 46.8 (35) days, respectively, P < .0001). In 
      propensity-score-matched and landmark-time-adjusted analyses, TARE was found to 
      be associated with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95 % CI, 0.60-0.91; P = .005) and 
      median OS of 7.1 months (95 % CI, 5.0-10.5) versus 4.9 months (95 % CI, 3.9-6.5) 
      for systemically treated patients. In an emulated target trial involving 236 
      patients with unilobular HCC-MVI, a low number of comorbidities, creatinine 
      levels <2.0 mg/dL, bilirubin levels <2.0 mg/dL, and international normalized 
      ratio <1.7, TARE was found to be associated with a hazard ratio of 0.57 (95 % CI, 
      0.39-0.83; P = .004) and a median OS of 12.9 months (95 % CI, 7.6-19.2) versus 
      6.5 months (95 % CI, 3.6-11.1) for the systemic therapy arm. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      propensity-score-matched analyses involving pragmatic and target trial HCC-MVI 
      cohorts, TARE was found to be associated with significant survival benefits 
      compared with systemic therapy. Although not a substitute for prospective trials, 
      these findings suggest that the increasing use of TARE for HCC-MVI is accompanied 
      by improved OS. Further trials of TARE in patients with HCC-MVI are needed, 
      especially to compare with newer systemic therapies.

TI  - EFFECT OF PAXLOVID TREATMENT DURING ACUTE COVID-19 ON LONG COVID ONSET: AN 
      EHR-BASED TARGET TRIAL EMULATION FROM THE N3C AND RECOVER CONSORTIA.
LID - 2024.01.20.24301525 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2024.01.20.24301525 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. 
      Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase 
      of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used 
      electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) 
      to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and 
      were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe 
      COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of 
      Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as 
      outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the 
      control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the 
      treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC 
      incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, 
      fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment 
      had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI 
      [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against 
      cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI 
      [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Paxlovid had a 
      weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, 
      suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for 
      preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology 
      of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than 
      that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential 
      heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes.

TI  - Assessing the use of observational methods and real-world data to emulate ongoing 
      randomized controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: There has been growing interest in better understanding the 
      potential of observational research methods in medical product evaluation and 
      regulatory decision-making. Previously, we used linked claims and electronic 
      health record data to emulate two ongoing randomized controlled trials, 
      characterizing the populations and results of each randomized controlled trial 
      prior to publication of its results. Here, our objective was to compare the 
      populations and results from the emulated trials with those of the now-published 
      randomized controlled trials. METHODS: This study compared participants' 
      demographic and clinical characteristics and study results between the emulated 
      trials, which used structured data from OptumLabs Data Warehouse, and the 
      published PRONOUNCE and GRADE trials. First, we examined the feasibility of 
      implementing the baseline participant characteristics included in the published 
      PRONOUNCE and GRADE trials' using real-world data and classified each variable as 
      ascertainable, partially ascertainable, or not ascertainable. Second, we compared 
      the emulated trials and published randomized controlled trials for baseline 
      patient characteristics (concordance determined using standardized mean 
      differences <0.20) and results of the primary and secondary endpoints 
      (concordance determined by direction of effect estimates and statistical 
      significance). RESULTS: The PRONOUNCE trial enrolled 544 participants, and the 
      emulated trial included 2226 propensity score-matched participants. In the 
      PRONOUNCE trial publication, one of the 32 baseline participant characteristics 
      was listed as an exclusion criterion on ClinicalTrials.gov but was ultimately not 
      used. Among the remaining 31 characteristics, 9 (29.0%) were ascertainable, 11 
      (35.5%) were partially ascertainable, and 10 (32.2%) were not ascertainable using 
      structured data from OptumLabs. For one additional variable, the PRONOUNCE trial 
      did not provide sufficient detail to allow its ascertainment. Of the nine 
      variables that were ascertainable, values in the emulated trial and published 
      randomized controlled trial were discordant for 6 (66.7%). The primary endpoint 
      of time from randomization to the first major adverse cardiovascular event and 
      secondary endpoints of nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke were concordant 
      between the emulated trial and published randomized controlled trial. The GRADE 
      trial enrolled 5047 participants, and the emulated trial included 7540 
      participants. In the GRADE trial publication, 8 of 34 (23.5%) baseline 
      participant characteristics were ascertainable, 14 (41.2%) were partially 
      ascertainable, and 11 (32.4%) were not ascertainable using structured data from 
      OptumLabs. For one variable, the GRADE trial did not provide sufficient detail to 
      allow for ascertainment. Of the eight variables that were ascertainable, values 
      in the emulated trial and published randomized controlled trial were discordant 
      for 4 (50.0%). The primary endpoint of time to hemoglobin A1c ≥7.0% was mostly 
      concordant between the emulated trial and the published randomized controlled 
      trial. CONCLUSION: Despite challenges, observational methods and real-world data 
      can be leveraged in certain important situations for a more timely evaluation of 
      drug effectiveness and safety in more diverse and representative patient 
      populations.

TI  - Adalimumab Monotherapy vs Adalimumab With Methotrexate for Psoriasis.
PG  - 731-738
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2025.1463 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: It is unclear whether concomitant methotrexate enhances the 
      effectiveness and persistence of adalimumab for psoriasis. The recent OPTIMAP 
      randomized clinical trial that tested adalimumab against adalimumab with 
      methotrexate could not adequately answer this question due to underrecruitment. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of using methotrexate with adalimumab 
      in people with plaque psoriasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This target 
      trial emulation cohort study replicated key aspects of the OPTIMAP trial design 
      using the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators 
      Register between 2007 and 2021. EXPOSURES: Adalimumab, 40 mg, every other week 
      monotherapy (comparator) vs adalimumab, 40 mg, every other week and methotrexate 
      weekly, with the dosage as determined by the clinician (intervention). MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference in the adalimumab 
      survival function at 1 year. The secondary outcomes included differences in 
      adalimumab survival function at 3 years; 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and 
      Severity Index (PASI75) at 1 year and 3 years; serious adverse events at 1 and 3 
      years; and adalimumab concentrations and antidrug antibodies at 1 year. Inverse 
      probability treatment and censoring weighting were used for covariate and missing 
      outcome adjustment. Flexible parametric survival models were fitted for survival 
      outcomes and generalized linear models for other outcomes. RESULTS: There were 
      231 and 1553 participants (754 female individuals [42.3%]) in the intervention 
      (median [IQR] age, 43.7 [35.1-53.1] years) and comparator (median [IQR] age, 43.6 
      [34.2-52.0] years) arms, respectively. Drug survival for the comparator arm at 1 
      year was 78.1% (95% CI, 76.1%-80.2%) and the intervention arm was 79.1% (95% CI, 
      71.8%-87.2%), with no evidence of difference (1.0%; 95% CI, -7.0% to 8.9%). 
      PASI75 at 1 year and 3 years in the comparator arm was 52.0% (95% CI, 
      47.7%-56.3%) and 32.4% (95% CI, 28.0%-36.8%), respectively; in the intervention 
      arm, PASI75 was 49.4% (95% CI, 31.5%-67.3%) and 37.2% (95% CI, 16.8%-57.6%), 
      respectively. There was no evidence of differences at 1 year and 3 years (-2.5%; 
      95% CI, -21.0% to 15.9% and 4.9%; 95% CI, -16.1% to 25.7%, respectively). There 
      was no evidence for a difference between the 2 arms for serious adverse events 
      and adalimumab concentrations, while the intervention arm had a lower antidrug 
      antibody level (risk difference, -123.7 AU/mL; 95% CI, -200.5 to -46.9). 
      CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that there was 
      no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness and persistence of adalimumab in 
      people with psoriasis between monotherapy and adalimumab with concomitant 
      methotrexate.

TI  - Adjunctive linezolid versus clindamycin for toxin inhibition in β-lactam-treated 
      patients with invasive group A streptococcal infections in 195 US hospitals from 
      2016 to 2021: a retrospective cohort study with target trial emulation.

LID - S1473-3099(24)00507-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00507-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adjunctive clindamycin use is associated with survival in invasive 
      group A streptococcus (GAS) infections but increasing clindamycin resistance in 
      GAS has called into question its durability for this indication. Linezolid also 
      inhibits GAS toxin and virulence factor production, but clinical efficacy data 
      remain sparse. METHODS: We retrospectively emulated a target multicentre, 
      non-blinded, non-inferiority trial to assess the efficacy of adjunctive linezolid 
      compared with clindamycin in adult inpatients with invasive GAS infection treated 
      with a β-lactam using the PINC AI database between 2016 and 2021. Patients were 
      eligible if they had a monomicrobial GAS culture and received adjunctive therapy 
      within 3 days of culture either concurrently or after β-lactam initiation and 
      completed at least 3 days of β-lactam therapy. The primary outcome was adjusted 
      risk ratio (aRR) of in-hospital mortality assessed by overlap-weighting using 
      propensity scores. Secondary outcomes were length of stay among survivors and 
      Clostridium difficile infection. FINDINGS: Of 1095 β-lactam-treated patients with 
      GAS, 829 (76%) received clindamycin and 266 (24%) received linezolid. In the 
      overlap weighted cohort, the receipt of linezolid was not associated with a 
      statistically significant different aRR of in-hospital mortality compared with 
      clindamycin (linezolid: 9·8% [26/266] vs clindamycin: 7·0% [58/829]; aRR: 0·92 
      [95% CI 0·42 to 1·43]; p=0·76). The risk difference was -0·005 (95% CI -0·05 to 
      0·04; p=0·81) and fell within the non-inferiority margin of 0·05. The primary 
      analysis results were consistent across important subgroups and sensitivity 
      analyses. Among survivors, median length of stay (adjusted ratio 0·96 [95% CI 
      0·16 to 0·08]; p=0·47) and C difficile infection risk (aRR 1·76 [95% CI 0·37 to 
      1·75]; p=0·29) were not statistically significantly different between the two 
      groups. INTERPRETATION: In this emulated trial of adult patients with invasive 
      GAS infections treated with β-lactam, linezolid appeared non-inferior to 
      clindamycin suggesting linezolid as an alternative for adjunctive antitoxin 
      therapy. FUNDING: The Intramural Research Program of the US National Institutes 
      of Health Clinical Center and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
      Disease.

TI  - Timing of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor initiation and post-discharge 
      outcomes in acute heart failure with diabetes: A population-based cohort study.
PG  - 307-316

AB  - AIMS: Results from randomized trials suggest benefit of sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor initiation in clinically stable acute heart 
      failure. We aim to examine the real-world effectiveness of early versus delayed 
      post-discharge SGLT2 inhibitor initiation in people with acute heart failure and 
      type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using linkable administrative databases in 
      Ontario, Canada, individuals aged 66 years or older with type 2 diabetes who were 
      discharged to the community from acute care hospitals for heart failure between 1 
      July 2016 and 31 March 2020 were included in this retrospective, population-based 
      cohort study. The primary outcome was hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or 
      cardiovascular mortality as a composite. Follow-up started from discharge for 
      maximum 1 year. We compared outcomes between post-discharge SGLT2 inhibitor 
      initiation within 3 days, 4-90 days, or 91-180 days, versus delayed initiation 
      for at least 180 days. The 'clone-censor-weight' approach with a target trial 
      emulation framework was used to address time-related biases. There were 9641 
      eligible individuals. After cloning and artificial censoring, there were 38 564 
      clones, 12 439 person-years, and 7584 events. Compared to delayed initiation for 
      at least 180 days, initiation within 3 days post-discharge was associated with a 
      lower 1-year risk of HHF or cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.65, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 0.45-0.83), while initiation 4-90 days (RR 0.83, 95% CI 
      0.72-0.93) or 91-180 days (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-0.97) showed smaller risk 
      reduction. CONCLUSION: Real-world evidence supports early SGLT2 inhibitor 
      initiation to reduce HHF or cardiovascular mortality in acute heart failure and 
      type 2 diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bivalent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were developed to counter increasing 
      susceptibility to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We evaluated the durability of 
      immunity and protection following first bivalent vaccination among nursing home 
      residents. METHODS: We evaluated anti-spike and neutralization titers from blood 
      in 653 community nursing home residents before and after each monovalent booster, 
      and a bivalent vaccine. Concurrent clinical outcomes were evaluated using 
      electronic health record data from a separate cohort of 3783 residents of 
      Veterans Affairs (VA) nursing homes who had received at least the primary series 
      monovalent vaccination. Using target trial emulation, we compared VA residents 
      who did and did not receive the bivalent vaccine to measure vaccine effectiveness 
      against infection, hospitalization, and death. FINDINGS: In the community cohort, 
      Omicron BA.5 neutralization activity rose after each monovalent and bivalent 
      booster vaccination regardless of prior infection history. Titers declined over 
      time but six months post-bivalent vaccination, BA.5 neutralization persisted at 
      detectable levels in 75% of infection-naive and 98% of prior-infected 
      individuals. In the VA nursing home cohort, bivalent vaccine added effectiveness 
      to monovalent booster vaccination by 18.5% for infection (95% confidence interval 
      (CI) -5.6, 34.0%), and 29.2% for hospitalization or death (95% CI -14.2, 56.2%) 
      over five months. INTERPRETATION: The level of protection declined after bivalent 
      vaccination over a 6 month period and may open a window of added vulnerability 
      before the next updated vaccine becomes available, suggesting a subset of nursing 
      home residents may benefit from an additional vaccination booster. FUNDING: CDC,

AB  - Reports of symptomatic rebound and/or test re-positivity among COVID-19 patients 
      following the standard five-day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have 
      sparked debates regarding optimal treatment timing and dosage. It is unclear 
      whether initiating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir immediately after symptom onset would 
      improve clinical outcomes and/or lead to post-treatment viral burden rebound due 
      to inadequate viral clearance during treatment. Here we show that, by emulating a 
      randomized target trial using real-world electronic medical record data from all 
      87,070 adult users of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in Hong Kong between 16th March 2022 
      and 15th January 2023, early initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment (0 to 
      1 days after symptom onset or diagnosis) significantly reduced the incidence of 
      28-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization compared to delayed initiation (2 
      or more days) (absolute risk reduction [ARR]: 1.50% (95% confidence interval 
      1.17-1.80%); relative risk [RR]: 0.77 (0.73, 0.82)), but may be associated with a 
      significant elevated risk of viral burden rebound (ARR: -1.08% (-1.55%, -0.46%)), 
      although the latter estimates were associated with high uncertainty due to 
      limited sample sizes. As such, patients should continue to initiate 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir early after symptom onset or diagnosis to better protect 
      against the more serious outcomes of hospitalization and mortality.

TI  - Reporting of Observational Studies Explicitly Aiming to Emulate Randomized 
      Trials: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e2336023
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.36023 [doi]
LID - e2336023
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Observational (nonexperimental) studies that aim to emulate a 
      randomized trial (ie, the target trial) are increasingly informing medical and 
      policy decision-making, but it is unclear how these studies are reported in the 
      literature. Consistent reporting is essential for quality appraisal, evidence 
      synthesis, and translation of evidence to policy and practice. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess the reporting of observational studies that explicitly aimed to emulate a 
      target trial. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of 
      Science for observational studies published between March 2012 and October 2022 
      that explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial of a health or medical 
      intervention. Two reviewers double-screened and -extracted data on study 
      characteristics, key predefined components of the target trial protocol and its 
      emulation (eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, treatment assignment, 
      outcome[s], follow-up, causal contrast[s], and analysis plan), and other items 
      related to the target trial emulation. FINDINGS: A total of 200 studies that 
      explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial were included. These studies included 
      26 subfields of medicine, and 168 (84%) were published from January 2020 to 
      October 2022. The aim to emulate a target trial was explicit in 70 study titles 
      (35%). Forty-three studies (22%) reported use of a published reporting guideline 
      (eg, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology). 
      Eighty-five studies (43%) did not describe all key items of how the target trial 
      was emulated and 113 (57%) did not describe the protocol of the target trial and 
      its emulation. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review of 200 studies 
      that explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial, reporting of how the target 
      trial was emulated was inconsistent. A reporting guideline for studies explicitly 
      aiming to emulate a target trial may improve the reporting of the target trial 
      protocols and other aspects of these emulation attempts.

TI  - Health Expenditures of Patients With Diabetes After Bariatric Surgery: Comparing 
      Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy.
PG  - 305-314
LID - 10.7326/ANNALS-24-00480 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) differ in 
      their effects on body weight and risk for reoperation. However, it is unclear 
      whether long-term health expenditures differ by procedure type in patients with 
      diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To compare health expenditures 3 years before and 5.5 years 
      after bariatric surgery between patients with diabetes undergoing RYGB versus SG. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation principles. 
      SETTING: Integrated health system. PATIENTS: Patients with diabetes undergoing 
      RYGB (n = 3147) or SG (n = 3510) from 2012 to 2019. MEASUREMENTS: Total, 
      inpatient, outpatient, and medication expenditures. RESULTS: Characteristics of 
      patients undergoing RYGB and SG were well balanced after weighting; 73% were 
      female, average body mass index was 43.8 kg/m(2), and average age was 50 years. 
      Expenditures per 6-month period decreased by about 30% for both groups, from 
      $4039.06 (95% CI, $3770.88 to $4326.31) 3 years before to $2441.13 (CI, $2151.07 
      to $2770.30) 5.5 years after RYGB and from $3918.37 (CI, $3658.75 to $4196.40) 3 
      years before to $2658.15 (CI, $2279.17 to $3100.16) 5.5 years after SG. Total 
      expenditures after surgery did not differ between groups through 5.5 years 
      (difference at 5.5 years, -$217.02 [CI, -$671.29 to $201.96]) except for the 
      first 6 months, when expenditures were transiently higher in the RYGB group 
      (difference, $564.32 [CI, $232.60 to $895.20]), driven by a higher inpatient 
      admission rate. Otherwise, postsurgical outpatient and medication expenditures 
      did not appear to differ between RYGB and SG. LIMITATION: Unobserved confounding. 
      CONCLUSION: Overall expenditures decreased substantially in the postsurgical 
      period, primarily due to reductions in pharmacy expenditures, with no differences 
      between RYGB and SG except in the first 6 months after surgery. PRIMARY FUNDING

TI  - Impact of time to antibiotics on clinical outcome in paediatric febrile 
      neutropenia: a target trial emulation of 1685 episodes.
PG  - 101226
LID - 10.1016/j.lanwpc.2024.101226 [doi]
LID - 101226
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prompt antibiotic administration for febrile neutropenia (FN) is 
      standard of care, and targets of time to antibiotics (TTA) <60 min are common. We 
      sought to determine the effect of TTA ≥60 versus <60 min on adverse outcomes 
      (intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death) in children with cancer and FN. 
      Effect modification by a decision rule that predicts infection (AUS-rule) and 
      bacteraemia were also investigated. METHODS: The prospective, multi-centre 
      (n = 8), Australian PICNICC study dataset was analysed. To control for 
      confounding, we used outcome regression adjusted for propensity score modelled as 
      restricted cubic spline with two degrees of freedom. The propensity score was 
      estimated from a logistic regression model for the exposure on the confounders, 
      identified a priori (age, sex, severely unwell, disease, chemotherapy intensity 
      and site). TTA was defined as time from from emergency triage to first antibiotic 
      dose. FINDINGS: 1685 FN episodes in 976 patients were included. Median TTA was 
      53 min (IQR 37-77 min, 1542 (92%) <120 min). An adverse outcome occurred in 43 
      (2.6%) episodes (39 ICU; 5 deaths). The confounder-adjusted point estimate 
      suggested a lower risk for adverse outcome associated with TTA ≥60 min (RR 0.62, 
      95% CI 0.32-1.21), but the wide 95% CI precluded definitive judgement about 
      strength and direction of the effect (unadjusted RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.26, 1.05). 
      Similarly, although the point estimates were suggestive of a null association or 
      reduced risk for adverse outcome associated with TTA ≥60 min for all comparisons 
      across bacteraemia or AUS-rule strata, the 95% CIs were imprecise. 
      INTERPRETATION: For children with FN, there was no definite evidence that TTA 
      ≥60 min from hospital triage (but within 2 h), increased risk of adverse outcome 
      or prolonged hospital admission. This study has important implications for FN TTA 
      mandates, suggesting a more nuanced approach is required. FUNDING: National

TI  - Estimated Effect of Restarting Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors after 
      Discontinuation on Kidney Outcomes and Mortality.
PG  - 1391-1401
LID - 10.1681/ASN.0000000000000425 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Restarting renin-angiotensin system inhibitor after discontinuation 
      was associated with a lower risk of kidney outcomes and mortality but not related 
      to hyperkalemia. Our findings support a proactive approach to restarting 
      renin-angiotensin system inhibitor among patients with CKD. BACKGROUND: While 
      renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) have been the mainstream treatment for 
      patients with CKD, they are often discontinued because of adverse effects such as 
      hyperkalemia and AKI. It is unknown whether restarting RASi after discontinuation 
      improves clinical outcomes. METHODS: Using the Osaka Consortium for Kidney 
      disease Research database, we performed a target trial emulation study including 
      6065 patients with an eGFR of 10–60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) who were followed up by 
      nephrologists and discontinued RASi between 2005 and 2021. With a 
      clone-censor-weight approach, we compared a treatment strategy for restarting 
      RASi within a year after discontinuation with that for not restarting RASi. 
      Patients were followed up for 5 years at maximum after RASi discontinuation. The 
      primary outcome was a composite kidney outcome (initiation of KRT, a ≥50% decline 
      in eGFR, or kidney failure [eGFR <5 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)]). Secondary outcomes 
      were all-cause death and incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels ≥5.5 
      mEq/L). RESULTS: Among those who discontinued RASi (mean [SD] age 66 [15] years, 
      62% male, mean [SD] eGFR 40 [26] ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), 2262 (37%) restarted RASi 
      within a year. Restarting RASi was associated with a lower hazard of the 
      composite kidney outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence intervals 
      [CIs], 0.78 to 0.93]) and all-cause death (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.80) 
      compared with not restarting RASi. The incidence of hyperkalemia did not differ 
      significantly between the two strategies (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.27). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Restarting RASi after discontinuation was associated with a lower 
      risk of kidney outcomes and mortality but not related to the incidence of 
      hyperkalemia.

TI  - ADHD Pharmacotherapy and Mortality in Individuals With ADHD.
PG  - 850-860
LID - 10.1001/jama.2024.0851 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with 
      increased risks of adverse health outcomes including premature death, but it is 
      unclear whether ADHD pharmacotherapy influences the mortality risk. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate whether initiation of ADHD pharmacotherapy was associated with 
      reduced mortality risk in individuals with ADHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: In an observational nationwide cohort study in Sweden applying the 
      target trial emulation framework, we identified individuals aged 6 through 64 
      years with an incident diagnosis of ADHD from 2007 through 2018 and no ADHD 
      medication dispensation prior to diagnosis. Follow-up started from ADHD diagnosis 
      until death, emigration, 2 years after ADHD diagnosis, or December 31, 2020, 
      whichever came first. EXPOSURES: ADHD medication initiation was defined as 
      dispensing of medication within 3 months of diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: We assessed all-cause mortality within 2 years of ADHD diagnosis, as 
      well as natural-cause (eg, physical conditions) and unnatural-cause mortality 
      (eg, unintentional injuries, suicide, and accidental poisonings). RESULTS: Of 
      148 578 individuals with ADHD (61 356 females [41.3%]), 84 204 (56.7%) initiated 
      ADHD medication. The median age at diagnosis was 17.4 years (IQR, 11.6-29.1 
      years). The 2-year mortality risk was lower in the initiation treatment strategy 
      group (39.1 per 10 000 individuals) than in the noninitiation treatment strategy 
      group (48.1 per 10 000 individuals), with a risk difference of -8.9 per 10 000 
      individuals (95% CI, -17.3 to -0.6). ADHD medication initiation was associated 
      with significantly lower rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 
      95% CI, 0.70 to 0.88) and unnatural-cause mortality (2-year mortality risk, 25.9 
      per 10 000 individuals vs 33.3 per 10 000 individuals; risk difference, -7.4 per 
      10 000 individuals; 95% CI, -14.2 to -0.5; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), but 
      not natural-cause mortality (2-year mortality risk, 13.1 per 10 000 individuals 
      vs 14.7 per 10 000 individuals; risk difference, -1.6 per 10 000 individuals; 95% 
      CI, -6.4 to 3.2; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Among individuals diagnosed with ADHD, medication initiation was associated with 
      significantly lower all-cause mortality, particularly for death due to unnatural 
      causes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of 1 cycle of assisted 
      reproductive technology (ART) vs. 3 cycles of intrauterine insemination (IUI). 
      DESIGN: Target trial emulation using observational data. SETTING: A healthcare 
      claims database (2011-2015). PATIENT(S): The patients were 29,021 women aged 
      18-45 years with an infertility diagnosis and no history of IUI or ART within the 
      past 12 months. INTERVENTION(S): One ART cycle immediately, with no more cycles 
      of ART or IUI within the next 4 months; or 1 IUI cycle immediately, with 2 
      additional consecutive cycles of IUI within the next 4 months unless pregnancy 
      occurred. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Live births, multiple births, congenital 
      malformations, preterm births, small-for-gestational-age newborns, 
      large-for-gestational-age newborns, admission to neonatal intensive care unit 
      (NICU), gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. 
      RESULT(S): The probability of live birth was 27.3% for ART and 26.3% for IUI. The 
      observational analogue of per-protocol risk difference (95% confidence interval) 
      for ART compared with IUI was 1.0% (-0.1%, 2.2%) for live births, 4.3% (3.7%, 
      4.9%) for multiple births, 3.4% (2.8%, 4.0%) for preterm births, 1.5% (0.9%, 
      2.1%) for NICU admissions, and 0.6% (0.2%, 1.0%) for gestational diabetes. The 
      risk differences for the other outcomes were <0.5%. The results of the 2 
      strategies were similar in women ≤40 years, but in women >40 years the 
      probability of live birth was greater for ART (14.4%) than for IUI (7.4%). 
      CONCLUSION(S): Compared with 3 cycles of IUI, 1 cycle of ART was estimated to 
      have a similar probability of live birth but slightly higher risks of multiple 
      gestations, preterm births, and NICU admissions.

TI  - Vaccine Effectiveness Among 5- to 17-year-old Individuals with Prior SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection: An EHR-Based Target Trial Emulation Study from the RECOVER Project.

AB  - The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents with prior 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, particularly for Omicron subvariants. We 
      evaluated vaccine effectiveness against reinfection with Omicron BA.1/2, BA.4/5, 
      XBB, and later subvariants among 5- to 17-year-olds using data from the RECOVER 
      initiative, a national electronic health record database covering 37 U.S. 
      pediatric institutions. We emulated target trials by age group and variant 
      period, comparing previously infected participants between January 2022 and 
      August 2023. During the BA.1/2 period, vaccination reduced the risk of 
      reinfection, with effectiveness rates of 62% in children and 65% in adolescents. 
      During the BA.4/5 period, protection effectiveness in children was 57%, whereas 
      no statistically significant protection was observed in adolescents. During the 
      XBB or later period, no significant protection was observed in either group. In 
      summary, COVID-19 vaccination provided protection against reinfection during 
      early and mid-Omicron periods in previously infected pediatric populations, but 
      effectiveness declined for later variants.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of valproic acid in different serum concentrations for 
      maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder: A retrospective cohort study using 
      target trial emulation framework.
PG  - 101678
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101678 [doi]
LID - 101678
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus on the optimal serum valproic acid (VPA) 
      concentration for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder (BD). We aimed to 
      investigate the association between serum VPA levels and risk of mood episode 
      recurrence. METHODS: We enrolled patients with BD from multiple medical 
      institutions in Taiwan between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2019. Patients 
      were divided into three groups according to their serum VPA concentrations (< 50 
      μg/ml, 50-74 μg/ml, and 75-104 μg/ml). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) compared times to mood episode recurrence using the < 
      50 μg/ml group as reference. A systematic review found relevant articles 
      published before February 2022 (PROSPERO: CRD42022309661), and corresponding 
      results were compared. FINDINGS: This cohort included 896 patients for an 
      intention-to-treat analysis. Compared with the < 50 μg/ml group, a 
      non-significantly lower risk of mood episode recurrence was found in the 50-74 
      μg/ml (aHR, 95% CI: 0·86, 0·71-1·05) and 75-104 μg/ml (0·91, 0·71-1·18) groups. A 
      per-protocol analysis of 481 patients found a significant risk reduction in the 
      50-74 μg/ml group (0·76, 0·60-0·97), with inconclusive results in the ≥ 75 μg/ml 
      group (1·03, 0·73-1·46). A meta-analysis including two studies (254 patients) and 
      our cohort found a similar significantly lower risk of mood episode recurrence in 
      the 50-74 μg/ml group (HR, 95% CI: 0·83, 0·69-0·99), while risk reduction in the 
      75-99 μg/ml group (0·62, 0·26-1·48) did not differ significantly from that in the 
      < 50 μg/ml group or the 50-74 μg/ml group. INTERPRETATION: The combined results 
      of this cohort and previous studies suggest that VPA between 50-74 μg/ml may be a 
      more effective concentration to prevent acute mood episodes during maintenance 
      therapy in patients with BD compared with VPA < 50 μg/ml. FUNDING: Ministry of 
      Science and Technology, Taiwan, and Chang Gung Medical Research Project.

TI  - Psoriasis Risk Is Lower in Type 2 Diabetes Patients Using Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 
      Inhibitors or Thiazolidinediones Compared to Sulfonylureas.
PG  - e70177
LID - 10.1111/cts.70177 [doi]
LID - e70177
AB  - The risk of psoriasis in diabetic patients has rarely been explored. This study 
      aims to compare the risk of incident psoriasis in patients with Type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D) who initiate dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) or 
      thiazolidinediones (TZDs) with those who initiate sulfonylureas, the most common 
      second-line glucose-lowering therapy, in addition to metformin monotherapy. This 
      sequential, propensity-score-matched, new-user comparative effectiveness study 
      utilized a target trial emulation framework. It included adults with T2D 
      receiving metformin monotherapy, using data from 2006 to 2015 from a general 
      population database in Taiwan. The primary outcome was the incidence of 
      psoriasis, determined through diagnoses recorded in urgent care, hospital, and 
      outpatient department records. Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regressions 
      with 1:4 propensity score matching was employed to evaluate the risk factors for 
      psoriasis after adjusting for comorbidities and the use of other medications. In 
      49,810 propensity score-matched adults with T2D (27,630 men [55.4%]; mean age 
      57.5 years) identified in the database, the incidence rate of psoriasis in DPP-4i 
      users was 188 cases per 100,000 person-years, lower than in sulfonylurea users 
      (467 cases per 100,000 person-years), with a hazard ratio(HR) of 0.422 (95% CI, 
      0.273-0.716). For the TZD vs. sulfonylurea comparison, the HR was 0.35, but the 
      smaller matched dataset resulted in wide confidence intervals. The findings 
      suggest that the use of DPP-4is is associated with a lower risk of psoriasis 
      compared to sulfonylureas in patients with T2D. These results can guide the 
      selection of glucose-lowering therapies in T2D patients who are at risk of 
      developing psoriasis.

TI  - Practice Patterns and Outcomes Associated With Anticoagulation Use Following 
      Sepsis Hospitalizations With New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - e009494
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.122.009494 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Practice patterns and outcomes associated with the use of oral 
      anticoagulation for arterial thromboembolism prevention following a 
      hospitalization with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) during sepsis are 
      unclear. METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study of patients ≥40 years 
      of age discharged alive following hospitalization with new-onset AF during sepsis 
      across 21 hospitals in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care 
      delivery system, years 2011 to 2018. Primary outcomes were ischemic 
      stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), with a safety outcome of major bleeding 
      events, both within 1 year of discharge alive from sepsis hospitalization. 
      Adjusted risk differences for outcomes between patients who did and did not 
      receive oral anticoagulation within 30 days of discharge were estimated using 
      marginal structural models fitted by inverse probability weighting using Super 
      Learning within a target trial emulation framework. RESULTS: Among 82 748 
      patients hospitalized with sepsis, 3992 (4.8%) had new-onset AF and survived to 
      hospital discharge; mean age was 78±11 years, 53% were men, and 70% were White. 
      Patients with new-onset AF during sepsis averaged 45±33% of telemetry monitoring 
      entries with AF, and 27% had AF present on the day of hospital discharge. Within 
      1 year of hospital discharge, 89 (2.2%) patients experienced stroke/TIA, 225 
      (5.6%) had major bleeding, and 1011 (25%) died. Within 30 days of discharge, 807 
      (20%) patients filled oral anticoagulation prescriptions, which were associated 
      with higher 1-year adjusted risks of ischemic stroke/TIA (5.69% versus 2.32%; 
      risk difference, 3.37% [95% CI, 0.36-6.38]) and no significant difference in 
      1-year adjusted risks of major bleeding (6.51% versus 7.10%; risk difference, 
      -0.59% [95% CI, -3.09 to 1.91]). Sensitivity analysis of ischemic stroke-only 
      outcomes showed a risk difference of 0.15% (95% CI, -1.72 to 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: 
      After hospitalization with new-onset AF during sepsis, oral anticoagulation use 
      was uncommon and associated with potentially higher stroke/TIA risk. Further 
      research to inform mechanisms of stroke and TIA and management of new-onset AF 
      after sepsis is needed.

TI  - Association between hypoglycaemic drug de-intensification, mortality and hospital 
      admission in older adults with type 2 diabetes: a cohort study emulating a target 
      trial.
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afaf160 [doi]
LID - afaf160
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoglycaemic drugs (sulfonylureas, glinides or insulins) are 
      commonly prescribed for older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) but may carry 
      risks of adverse events. Whether de-intensifying hypoglycaemic drugs is 
      associated with clinical benefit in older adults remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the association between de-intensification of hypoglycaemic drugs and 
      clinical outcomes in older adults with T2D. METHODS: Cohort study conducted with 
      the target trial emulation approach, using data collected from 2000 French 
      general practises between January 2010 and February 2019 (The Health Improvement 
      Network-THIN database). Eligible participants were ≥75 years old, on stable 
      hypoglycaemic drugs (no change in drug or dose) for at least 6 months, and had an 
      HbA1c value <9%. Hypoglycaemic drug de-intensification (exposure) was defined as 
      cessation or reduction of ≥50% of total dose. The primary outcome was a composite 
      measure of all-cause death or hospital admissions within 3 months, and its 
      association with exposure was assessed using multivariable logistic regression 
      adjusted for potential baseline confounders. RESULTS: The study included 14 383 
      unique individuals corresponding to 177 314 trial emulation participants (mean 
      age 80 years; 44.7% female). Of these, 6480 participants were allocated to 
      de-intensification group, and 170 834 to the control group. At 3 months, the 
      primary outcome occurred in 3.96% of the de-intensification group and 2.99% of 
      controls [adjusted relative risk, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.22-1.43)]. Subgroup analyses 
      showed consistent associations across most participants' profiles. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In older adults with T2D, de-intensification of hypoglycaemic drugs was 
      associated with a higher short-term risk of all-cause death or hospitalisation.

      regarding kidney outcomes unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare kidney outcomes between 
      initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who 
      were receiving antihyperglycemic treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This target trial emulation used nationwide, population-based routinely collected 
      Danish health care data to compare initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin 
      in adults with type 2 diabetes who received antihyperglycemic treatment between 
      June 1, 2014, and October 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to 
      August 2024. Persons were followed up until an outcome, emigration, death, 6 
      years, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first. EXPOSURE: Initiation of 
      empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included 
      acute kidney injury, incident chronic kidney disease (stages G3 to G5 or stage A2 
      or A3), and progression of chronic kidney disease (≥40% decrease in estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate from baseline). Risks of kidney outcomes were 
      estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses using an Aalen-Johansen 
      estimator that adjusted for 56 potential confounders and considered death as a 
      competing event. RESULTS: A total of 32 819 individuals who initiated treatment 
      with empagliflozin and 17 464 with dapagliflozin were included (median [IQR] age, 
      63 [54-71] years; 18 872 female individuals [37.5%]; median [IQR] estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate, 88 [73-104] mL/min/1.73 m2). After weighting, all 
      measured covariates were well balanced between the groups. In intention-to-treat 
      analyses, people who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin 
      exhibited comparable 6-year risks of acute kidney injury (18.2% vs 18.5%; risk 
      ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06), chronic kidney disease stages G3 to G5 (11.8% vs 
      12.1%; risk ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89-1.05), chronic kidney disease stage A2 or 
      A3 (14.8% vs 14.3%; risk ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93-1.15), and progression of 
      chronic kidney disease (5.3% vs 5.7%; risk ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.56-1.58). The 
      primary analyses were supported by corresponding per-protocol analyses. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that people 
      with type 2 diabetes who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin 
      had comparable long-term kidney outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To build on the recently completed GRADE (Glycemia Reduction 
      Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) randomised trial 
      examining the comparative effectiveness of second line glucose lowering drugs in 
      achieving and maintaining glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. 
      DESIGN: Emulation of a target trial. SETTING: Medical and pharmacy claims data 
      from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a de-identified US national dataset of 
      beneficiaries of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage plans, 29 March 2013 
      to 30 June 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes who first 
      started taking glimepiride, sitagliptin, liraglutide, insulin glargine, or 
      canagliflozin between 29 March 2013 and 30 June 2021. Participants were treatment 
      naive or were receiving metformin monotherapy at the time of starting the study 
      drug. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcomes were time to primary and secondary 
      metabolic failure of the assigned treatment, calculated as days to haemoglobin 
      A(1c) levels of ≥7.0% and >7.5%, respectively. Secondary metabolic, 
      cardiovascular, and microvascular outcomes were analysed as specified in the 
      GRADE statistical analysis plan. Propensity scores were estimated with the 
      gradient boosting method, and inverse propensity score weighting was used to 
      emulate randomisation to the treatment groups, which were then compared with Cox 
      proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: The study cohort included participants 
      starting treatment with glimepiride (n=20 511), liraglutide (n=5569), sitagliptin 
      (n=13 039), insulin glargine (n=7262), and canagliflozin (n=5290). The insulin 
      glargine arm was excluded because of insufficient control of confounding. Median 
      times to primary metabolic failure were 439 (95% confidence interval 400 to 489) 
      days in the canagliflozin arm, 439 (426 to 453) days in the glimepiride arm, 624 
      (567 to 731) days in the liraglutide arm, and 461 (442 to 482) days in the 
      sitagliptin arm. Median time to secondary metabolic failure was also longest in 
      the liraglutide arm. Adults receiving liraglutide had the lowest one year 
      cumulative incidence rate of primary metabolic failure (0.37, 95% confidence 
      interval 0.35 to 0.40) followed by sitagliptin (0.44, 0.43 to 0.45), glimepiride 
      (0.45, 0.44 to 0.45), and canagliflozin (0.46, 0.44 to 0.48). Similarly, the one 
      year cumulative incidence rate of secondary metabolic failure was 0.27 (0.25 to 
      0.29) in the canagliflozin arm, 0.28 (0.27 to 0.29) in the glimepiride arm, 0.23 
      (0.21 to 0.26) in the liraglutide arm, and 0.28 (0.27 to 0.29) in the sitagliptin 
      arm. No differences were observed between the study arms in the rates of 
      microvascular and macrovascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: In this target trial 
      emulation of an expanded GRADE study framework, liraglutide was more effective in 
      achieving and maintaining glycaemic control as a second line glucose lowering 
      drug than canagliflozin, sitagliptin, or glimepiride.

TI  - Effects of Warfarin on the Risks of Mortality, Acute Heart Failure, and Infection 
      Resolution in Patients With Infective Endocarditis: A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - e041965
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.125.041965 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) can be complicated by acute heart failure 
      and bacteremia, which can account for increased mortality. The role of 
      anticoagulation with warfarin in IE is controversial. This study aimed to study 
      the effects of anticoagulation with warfarin on survival in patients with IE, 
      through reducing the risks of thromboembolism and possibly shortening infection 
      time. METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based cohort study using the 
      Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System from Hong Kong. Patients diagnosed 
      with IE between January 1, 1997 and August 31, 2020 were identified using 
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. A target 
      pragmatic trial was emulated using the observational data with 
      cloning-censoring-weighting approach, comparing the treatment effect of 
      initiation warfarin within 14 days versus no warfarin on the risk of all-cause 
      mortality, acute heart failure, and achieving negative blood culture in patients 
      with IE. Pooled logistic regression was applied to estimate 12-week survival or 
      cumulative incidence differences and risk ratios (RRs). RESULTS: A total of 5121 
      patients with IE with an average age of 55.7 years (SD:18.9) were included. 
      Warfarin use was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality with 12-week 
      survival difference of 6.5% (95% CI, 2.6%-9.9%) and RR of 0.72 (95% CI, 
      0.57-0.88) and a greater benefit of achieving negative blood cultures with 
      12-week cumulative incidence difference of 11.4% (95% CI, 5.4%-16.5%) and RR of 
      1.13 (95% CI, 1.06-1.20) but similar risks of acute heart failure (RR, 1.07 [95% 
      CI, 0.87-1.30]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IE initiating warfarin had 
      significantly lower risk of mortality with potential benefits on achieving 
      negative blood cultures, suggesting benefit in infection resolution but a similar 
      risk of acute heart failure.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The practice of deprescribing antihypertensive medications is common 
      among long-term care residents, yet the effect on cardiovascular outcomes is 
      unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of hospitalization for myocardial 
      infarction (MI) or stroke among long-term care residents who are deprescribed or 
      continue antihypertensive therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      comparative effectiveness research study used target trial emulation with 
      observational electronic health record data from long-term care residents aged 65 
      years or older admitted to US Department of Veterans Affairs community living 
      centers between October 1, 2006, and September 30, 2019, and taking at least 1 
      antihypertensive medication. Analyses were conducted between August 2023 and 
      August 2024. EXPOSURE: A reduction in the number of antihypertensive medications 
      or dose (by ≥30%), assessed using barcode medication administration data. MAIN 
      OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Incidence of MI and stroke hospitalization up to 2 years 
      was assessed using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and 
      International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 
      Tenth Revision codes. A pooled logistic regression model with inverse probability 
      of treatment weighting (IPTW) and inverse probability of censoring weighting 
      (IPCW) was used to estimate per-protocol effects. RESULTS: Of 13 096 long-term 
      care residents (97.4% men; median age, 77 years [IQR, 70-84 years]) taking 
      antihypertensive medication, 17.8% were deprescribed antihypertensive medication 
      over a period of 12 weeks. The estimated unadjusted cumulative incidence of 
      stroke or MI hospitalization over 2 years was similar among residents who were 
      and were not deprescribed antihypertensives in per-protocol analyses (11.2% vs 
      8.8%; difference, 2.4 percentage points [95% CI, -2.3 to 7.1 percentage points]). 
      Participant characteristics were balanced after applying IPTW and IPCW; all 
      standardized mean differences were less than 0.05. After full adjustment for 
      confounding and informative censoring, the per-protocol analysis results showed 
      no association of antihypertensive deprescribing with MI or stroke 
      hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70-1.26). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness research study, deprescribing 
      antihypertensive medication was not associated with risk of hospitalization for 
      MI or stroke in long-term care residents. These findings may be informative for 
      long-term care residents and clinicians who are considering deprescribing 
      antihypertensive medications.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Alternative Treatment Approaches to Secondary 
      Hyperparathyroidism in Patients Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis: An 
      Observational Trial Emulation.

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Optimal approaches to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism 
      (SHPT) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have yet to be established in 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs). STUDY DESIGN: Two observational clinical 
      trial emulations. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Both emulations included adults 
      receiving in-center HD from a national dialysis organization. The patients who 
      had SHPT in the period between 2009 and 2014, were insured for≥180 days by 
      Medicare as primary payer, and did not have contraindications or poor health 
      status limiting theoretical trial participation. EXPOSURE: The parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH) Target Trial emulation included patients with new-onset SHPT (first 
      PTH 300-600pg/mL), with 2 arms defined as up-titration of either vitamin D 
      sterols or cinacalcet within 30 days (lower target) or no up-titration (higher 
      target). The Agent Trial emulation included patients with a PTH≥300 pg/mL while 
      on≥6μg weekly of vitamin D sterol (paricalcitol equivalent dose) and no prior 
      history of cinacalcet. The 2 arms were defined by the first dose or agent change 
      within 30 days (vitamin D-favoring [vitamin-D was up-titrated] vs 
      cinacalcet-favoring [cinacalcet was added] vs nondefined [neither applies]). 
      Multiple trials per patient were allowed in trial 2. OUTCOME: The primary outcome 
      was all-cause death over 24 months; secondary outcomes included cardiovascular 
      (CV) hospitalization or the composite of CV hospitalization or death. ANALYTICAL 
      APPROACH: Pooled logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 1,152 patients in the 
      PTH Target Trial (635 lower target and 517 higher target). There were 2,726 
      unique patients with 6,727 patient trials in the Agent Trial (6,268 vitamin 
      D-favoring trials and 459 cinacalcet-favoring trials). The lower PTH target 
      approach was associated with reduced adjusted hazard of death (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 
      0.52-0.93]), CV hospitalization (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63-0.98]), and their 
      composite (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.61-0.89]). The cinacalcet-favoring approach 
      demonstrated lower adjusted hazard of death compared to the vitamin D-favoring 
      approach (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.62-0.99]), but not of CV hospitalization or the 
      composite outcome. LIMITATIONS: Potential for residual confounding; low use of 
      cinacalcet with low power. CONCLUSIONS: SHPT management that is focused on lower 
      PTH targets may lower mortality and CV disease in patients receiving HD. These 
      findings should be confirmed in a pragmatic randomized trial. PLAIN-LANGUAGE 
      SUMMARY: Optimal approaches to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) have 
      not been established in randomized controlled trials. Data from a national 
      dialysis organization was used to identify patients with SHPT in whom escalated 
      treatment may be indicated. The approach to treatment was defined based on 
      observed upward titration of SHPT-controlling medications: earlier titration 
      (lower target) versus delayed titration (higher target); and the choice of 
      medication (cinacalcet vs vitamin D sterols). In the first trial emulation, we 
      estimated a 29% lower rate of death and 26% lower rate of cardiovascular disease 
      or death for patients managed with a lower versus higher target approach. 
      Cinacalcet versus vitamin D-favoring approaches were not consistently associated 
      with outcomes in the second trial emulation. This observational study suggests 
      the need for additional clinical trials of SHPT treatment intensity.

LID - e25917
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are routinely excluded from clinical trials, leading 
      to the absence or delay in even the most basic pharmacokinetic (PK) information 
      needed for dosing in pregnancy. When available, pregnancy PK studies use a small 
      sample size, resulting in limited safety information. We discuss key study design 
      elements that may enhance the timely availability of pregnancy data, including 
      the role and timing of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate pregnancy 
      safety; efficacy and safety outcome measures; stand-alone protocols, platform 
      trials, single arm studies, sample size and the effect that follow-up time during 
      gestation has on analysis interpretations; and observational studies. DISCUSSION: 
      Pregnancy PK should be studied during drug development, after dosing in 
      non-pregnant persons is established (unless non-clinical or other data raise 
      pregnancy concerns). RCTs should evaluate the safety during pregnancy of priority 
      new HIV agents that are likely to be used by large numbers of females of 
      childbearing age. Key endpoints for pregnancy safety studies include birth 
      outcomes (prematurity, small for gestational age and stillbirth) and neonatal 
      death, with traditional adverse events and infant growth also measured 
      (congenital anomalies are best studied through surveillance). We recommend that 
      viral efficacy be studied as a secondary endpoint of pregnancy RCTs, once PK 
      studies confirm adequate drug exposure in pregnancy. RCTs typically use a 
      stand-alone protocol for new agents. In contrast, master protocols using a 
      platform design can add agents over time, possibly speeding safety data 
      ascertainment. To speed accrual, stand-alone pregnancy trial protocols can 
      include pre-specified starting rules based upon adequate PK levels in pregnancy; 
      and seamless master protocols or platform trials can include a pregnancy PK and 
      safety component. When RCTs are unethical or cost-prohibitive, observational 
      studies should be conducted, preferably using target trial emulation to avoid 
      bias. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy PK needs to be obtained earlier in drug evaluation. 
      Timely RCTs are needed to understand safety in pregnancy for high-priority new 
      HIV agents. RCTs that enrol pregnant women should focus on outcomes unique to 
      pregnancy, and observational studies should focus on questions that RCTs are not 
      equipped to answer.

TI  - Allopurinol Initiation and All-Cause Mortality Among Patients With Gout and 
      Concurrent Chronic Kidney Disease : A Population-Based Cohort Study.
PG  - 461-470
LID - 10.7326/M21-2347 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two recent randomized clinical trials of escalating doses of 
      allopurinol for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) reported no 
      benefits but potentially increased risk for death. Whether the risk could occur 
      in patients with gout and concurrent CKD remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine 
      the relation of allopurinol initiation, allopurinol dose escalation, and 
      achieving target serum urate (SU) level after allopurinol initiation to all-cause 
      mortality in patients with both gout and CKD. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The 
      Health Improvement Network U.K. primary care database (2000 to 2019). 
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 40 years or older who had gout and concurrent 
      moderate-to-severe CKD. MEASUREMENTS: The association between allopurinol 
      initiation and all-cause mortality over 5-year follow-up in propensity score 
      (PS)-matched cohorts was examined. Analysis of hypothetical trials were emulated: 
      achieving target SU level (<0.36 mmol/L) versus not achieving target SU level and 
      dose escalation versus no dose escalation for mortality over 5-year follow-up in 
      allopurinol initiators. RESULTS: Mortality was 4.9 and 5.8 per 100 person-years 
      in 5277 allopurinol initiators and 5277 PS-matched noninitiators, respectively 
      (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.77 to 0.93]). In the target trial emulation 
      analysis, the HR of mortality for the achieving target SU level group compared 
      with the not achieving target SU level group was 0.87 (CI, 0.75 to 1.01); the HR 
      of mortality for allopurinol in the dose escalation group versus the no dose 
      escalation group was 0.88 (CI, 0.73 to 1.07). LIMITATION: Residual confounding 
      cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSION: In this population-based data, neither 
      allopurinol initiation, nor achieving target SU level with allopurinol, nor 
      allopurinol dose escalation was associated with increased mortality in patients 
      with gout and concurrent CKD. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Project Program of National 
      Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders.

TI  - Non-TNFi biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs in rheumatoid

      active-comparator, new-user study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare treatment outcomes in rheumatoid 
      arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) between initiators of 
      rituximab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and tofacitinib using the Target Trial 
      Emulation Framework. METHODS: We emulated three trials comparing abatacept, 
      tocilizumab, and tofacitinib with rituximab (reference). Patients fulfilling 
      validated RA-ILD algorithms initiating one of these non-TNFi b/tsDMARDs were 
      propensity score (PS)-matched (1:1) using national Veterans Affairs (VA) data 
      from 2006 to 2020. PS models included demographics, comorbidities, general health 
      status indicators, and several RA- and ILD-related severity measures. Composite 
      study outcomes were death and respiratory-related hospitalization, ascertained by 
      VA data and linkages to the National Death Index and Medicare, over three-year 
      (primary) and one-year follow-up periods (secondary). Cox regression models were 
      used to analyze study outcomes adjusting for any unbalanced variables. Several 
      sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the primary cohort, 
      we 1:1 matched abatacept (n = 150), tocilizumab (n = 73), and tofacitinib (n = 
      94) with equal numbers of rituximab initiators (mean age 68.1-69.4 years, 88-92 % 
      male). There were no significant differences in the primary composite outcome 
      among any of the comparisons (abatacept aHR: 1.03 [0.72, 1.47]; tocilizumab aHR: 
      1.15 [0.68, 1.93]; tofacitinib aHR: 0.89 [0.54, 1.46]). Secondary, subgroup, and 
      sensitivity analyses supported the main findings. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find 
      significant differences in mortality or respiratory hospitalization between 
      RA-ILD patients initiating different non-TNFi b/tsDMARDs, though estimates were 
      imprecise, and residual confounding may be present. These findings emphasize the 
      need for clinical trials of advanced immunomodulatory therapies in RA-ILD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncertainty exists regarding patient outcomes when using TNF 
      inhibitors versus other biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung 
      disease (ILD). We compared survival and respiratory hospitalisation outcomes 
      following initiation of TNF-inhibitor or non-TNF inhibitor biological or targeted 
      synthetic DMARDs for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD. METHODS: 
      We did a retrospective, active-comparator, new-user, observational cohort study 
      with propensity score matching following the target trial emulation framework 
      using US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic and administrative health 
      records. VA health-care enrollees with rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD and no 
      previous receipt of ILD-directed therapies (eg, antifibrotics) who initiated a 
      TNF inhibitor or non-TNF inhibitor between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2018, were 
      included. Propensity score matching was performed using demographics, health-care 
      use, health behaviours, comorbidity burden, rheumatoid arthritis-related severity 
      factors, and ILD-related severity factors, including baseline forced vital 
      capacity. Study outcomes were respiratory hospitalisation, all-cause mortality, 
      and respiratory-related death over follow-up of up to 3 years, from VA, Medicare, 
      and National Death Index data. People with lived experience of rheumatoid 
      arthritis-associated ILD were not involved in the design or conduct of this 
      study. FINDINGS: Of 1047 patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated-ILD who 
      initiated biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs, we matched 237 patients who 
      had initiated TNF inhibitors and 237 who had initiated non-TNF inhibitors (mean 
      age 68 years [SD 9]); 434 (92%) of 474 were male and 40 (8%) were female. Death 
      and respiratory hospitalisation did not significantly differ between groups 
      (adjusted hazard ratio 1·21 [95% CI 0·92-1·58]). Respiratory hospitalisation 
      (1·27 [0·91-1·76]), all-cause mortality (1·15 [0·83-1·60]), and respiratory 
      mortality (1·38 [0·79-2·42]) did not differ between groups. Secondary, 
      sensitivity, and subgroup analyses supported the primary findings. 
      INTERPRETATION: In US veterans with rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD, no 
      difference in outcomes were seen between those who started TNF inhibitors 
      compared to those starting non-TNF biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. These 
      data do not support systematic avoidance of TNF inhibitors in all people with 
      rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD. Comparative efficacy trials in patients with 
      rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD are needed given the potential for residual 
      confounding and selection bias in observational studies. FUNDING: US Department 
      of Veterans Affairs.

TI  - Evaluating different low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds to initiate 
      statin for prevention of cardiovascular diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: A target trial emulation study.
PG  - 1877-1887
LID - 10.1111/dom.15503 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of statin therapy for primary 
      prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) when initiating therapy at different 
      baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using territory-wide public 
      electronic medical records in Hong Kong, we emulated a sequence of trials on 
      patients with T2DM with elevated LDL-C levels in every calendar month from 
      January 2008 to December 2014. Pooled logistic regression was applied to obtain 
      the hazard ratios for the major CVDs (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart 
      failure), all-cause mortality and major adverse events (myopathies and liver 
      dysfunction) of statin therapy. RESULTS: The estimated hazard ratios (95% 
      confidence intervals) of CVD incidence for statin initiation were 0.78 (0.72, 
      0.84) in patients with baseline LDL-C of 1.8-2.5 mmol/L (i.e., 70-99 mg/dL) and 
      0.90 (0.88, 0.92) in patients with baseline LDL-C ≥2.6 mmol/L (i.e., ≥100 mg/dL) 
      in intention-to-treat analysis, which was 0.59 (0.51, 0.68) and 0.77 (0.74, 0.81) 
      in per-protocol analysis, respectively. No significant increased risks were 
      observed for the major adverse events. The absolute 10-year risk difference of 
      overall CVD in per-protocol analysis was -7.1% (-10.7%, -3.6%) and -3.9% (-5.1%, 
      -2.7%) in patients with baseline LDL-C 1.8-2.5 and ≥2.6 mmol/L, respectively. The 
      effectiveness and safety were consistently observed in patients aged >75 years 
      initiating statin at both LDL-C thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the 
      threshold of 2.6 mmol/L, initiating statin in patients with a lower baseline 
      LDL-C level at 1.8-2.5 mmol/L can further reduce the risks of CVD and all-cause 
      mortality without significantly increasing the risk of major adverse events in 
      patients with T2DM, including patients aged >75 years.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of bivalent BA.4-5 and BA.1 mRNA booster vaccines among 
      adults aged ≥50 years in Nordic countries: nationwide cohort study.
PG  - e075286
LID - 10.1136/bmj-2022-075286 [doi]
LID - e075286
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the bivalent mRNA booster vaccines 
      containing the original SARS-CoV-2 and omicron BA.4-5 or BA.1 subvariants as the 
      fourth dose against severe covid-19. DESIGN: Nationwide cohort analyses, using 
      target trial emulation. SETTING: Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, from 1 
      July 2022 to 10 April 2023. PARTICIPANTS: People aged ≥50 years who had received 
      at least three doses of covid-19 vaccine (that is, a primary course and a first 
      booster). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to compare 
      the risk of hospital admission and death related to covid-19 in people who 
      received a bivalent Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) or Spikevax (Moderna) BA.4-5 or 
      BA.1 mRNA booster vaccine as a fourth dose (second booster) with three dose 
      (first booster) vaccinated people and between four dose vaccinated people. 
      RESULTS: A total of 1 634 199 people receiving bivalent BA.4-5 fourth dose 
      booster and 1 042 124 receiving bivalent BA.1 fourth dose booster across the four 
      Nordic countries were included. Receipt of a bivalent BA.4-5 booster as a fourth 
      dose was associated with a comparative vaccine effectiveness against admission to 
      hospital with covid-19 of 67.8% (95% confidence interval 63.1% to 72.5%) and a 
      risk difference of -91.9 (95% confidence interval -152.4 to -31.4) per 100 000 
      people at three months of follow-up compared with having received three doses of 
      vaccine (289 v 893 events). The corresponding comparative vaccine effectiveness 
      and risk difference for bivalent BA.1 boosters (332 v 977 events) were 65.8% 
      (59.1% to 72.4%) and -112.9 (-179.6 to -46.2) per 100 000, respectively. 
      Comparative vaccine effectiveness and risk difference against covid-19 related 
      death were 69.8% (52.8% to 86.8%) and -34.1 (-40.1 to -28.2) per 100 000 for 
      bivalent BA.4-5 booster (93 v 325 events) and 70.0% (50.3% to 89.7%) and -38.7 
      (-65.4 to -12.0) per 100 000 for BA.1 booster (86 v 286) as a fourth dose. 
      Comparing bivalent BA.4-5 and BA.1 boosters as a fourth dose directly resulted in 
      a three month comparative vaccine effectiveness and corresponding risk difference 
      of -14.9% (-62.3% to 32.4%) and 10.0 (-14.4 to 34.4) per 100 000 people for 
      admission to hospital with covid-19 (802 v 932 unweighted events) and -40.7% 
      (-123.4% to 42.1%) and 8.1 (-3.3 to 19.4) per 100 000 for covid-19 related death 
      (229 v 243 unweighted events). The comparative vaccine effectiveness did not 
      differ across sex and age (</≥70 years) and seemed to be sustained up to six 
      months from the day of vaccination with modest waning. CONCLUSION: Vaccination 
      with bivalent BA.4-5 or BA.1 mRNA booster vaccines as a fourth dose was 
      associated with reduced rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death 
      among adults aged ≥50 years. The protection afforded by the bivalent BA.4-5 and 
      BA.1 boosters did not differ significantly when directly compared, and any 
      potential difference would most likely be very small in absolute numbers.

TI  - Rituximab vs Cyclophosphamide Induction Therapy for Patients With Granulomatosis 
      With Polyangiitis.
PG  - e2243799
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.43799 [doi]
LID - e2243799
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Results of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated rituximab's 
      noninferiority to cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for antineutrophil 
      cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV), with neither treatment 
      having a specific advantage for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). However, 
      post hoc analysis results have suggested that rituximab might be more effective 
      than cyclophosphamide in inducing remission in patients with proteinase 
      3-positive AAV. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of rituximab and 
      cyclophosphamide in inducing GPA remission in a large population of unselected 
      patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study 
      used multicenter target trial emulation observational data from 32 French 
      hospitals in the French Vasculitis Study Group Registry. Groups were determined 
      according to treatments received, without any intervention from the 
      investigators. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to correct for 
      baseline imbalance between groups. Participants included patients with newly 
      diagnosed or relapsing GPA who satisfied American College of Rheumatology 
      classification criteria and/or Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature. 
      Data were analyzed from October 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022. EXPOSURES: At least 1 
      infusion of rituximab or cyclophosphamide for induction therapy between April 1, 
      2008, and April 1, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 
      remission rate at month 6 (±2 months), with remission defined as a Birmingham 
      Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of 0 and prednisone dose of 10 mg/d or less. The 
      BVAS is a validated tool for small-vessel vasculitis and used to assess the level 
      of disease activity, with a numerical weight attached to each involved organ 
      system. The BVAS has a range of 0 to 63 points; a score of 0 indicates no disease 
      activity. Subgroup analyses included the primary outcome for patients with a new 
      diagnosis, for most recently treated patients, and for patients with 
      myeloperoxidase-ANCA positivity. RESULTS: Among 194 patients with GPA included in 
      the analysis (mean [SD] age, 54 [15] years; 110 men [56.7%]), 165 (85.1%) had a 
      new diagnosis, and 147 of 182 with data available (80.8%) had proteinase 3-ANCA 
      positivity. Sixty-one patients received rituximab and 133 received 
      cyclophosphamide for induction therapy. In the weighted analysis, the primary 
      outcome was reached for 73.1% of patients receiving rituximab vs 40.1% receiving 
      cyclophosphamide (relative risk [RR], 1.82 [95% CI, 1.22-2.73]; risk difference, 
      33.0% [95% CI, 12.2%-53.8%]; E value for RR, 3.05). Similar results were observed 
      in the subgroup of patients with newly diagnosed GPA and those with a more recent 
      treatment. In the subset of 27 patients with myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA, 8 
      of 10 rituximab recipients and 8 of 17 cyclophosphamide recipients met the 
      primary end point (unweighted RR, 1.73 [95% CI, 0.96-3.11]). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this comparativeness effectiveness study using clinical data, 
      rituximab induction therapy for GPA was more frequently associated with remission 
      than cyclophosphamide. These results inform clinical decision-making concerning 
      the choice of remission induction therapy for this subset of patients with AAV.

LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.0353 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and risk of 
      Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) remains to be confirmed. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of ADRD associated with GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is in 
      people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This target 
      trial emulation study used electronic health record data from OneFlorida+ 
      Clinical Research Consortium from January 2014 to June 2023. Patients were 50 
      years or older with T2D and no prior diagnosis of ADRD or antidementia treatment. 
      Among the 396 963 eligible patients with T2D, 33 858 were included in the GLP-1RA 
      vs other glucose-lowering drug (GLD) cohort, 34 185 in the SGLT2i vs other GLD 
      cohort, and 24 117 in the GLP-1RA vs SGLT2i cohort. EXPOSURES: Initiation of 
      treatment with a GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, or other second-line GLD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: ADRD was identified using clinical diagnosis codes. Hazard ratios (HRs) 
      with 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models with 
      inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to adjust for potential 
      confounders. RESULTS: This study included 33 858 patients in the GLP-1RA vs other 
      GLD cohort (mean age, 65 years; 53.1% female), 34 185 patients in the SGLT2i vs 
      other GLD cohort (mean age, 65.8 years; 49.3% female), and 24 117 patients in the 
      GLP-1RA vs SGLT2i cohort (mean age, 63.8 years; 51.7% female). In IPTW-weighted 
      cohorts, the incidence rate of ADRD was lower in GLP-1RA initiators compared with 
      other GLD initiators (rate difference [RD], -2.26 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 
      -2.88 to -1.64]), yielding an HR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.96). SGLT2i initiators 
      had a lower incidence than other GLD initiators (RD, -3.05 per 1000 person-years 
      [95% CI, -3.68 to -2.42]), yielding an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75). There was 
      no difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is, with an RD of -0.09 per 1000 
      person-years (95% CI, -0.80 to 0.63) and an HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72-1.32). 
      CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In people with T2D, both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were 
      statistically significantly associated with decreased risk of ADRD compared with 
      other GLDs, and no difference was observed between both drugs.

TI  - Deprescribing of Antihypertensive Medications and Cognitive Function in Nursing 
      Home Residents.
PG  - 1347-1355
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.4851 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Antihypertensive medication deprescribing is common among nursing 
      home residents, yet its association with cognitive decline remains uncertain. 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of deprescribing antihypertensive 
      medication with changes in cognitive function in nursing home residents. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study using a target trial emulation 
      approach included VA long-term care residents aged 65 years or older with stays 
      of at least 12 weeks from 2006 to 2019. Residents who were not prescribed 
      antihypertensive medication, with blood pressure greater than 160/90 mm Hg, or 
      with heart failure were excluded. Eligible residents with stable medication use 
      for 4 weeks were classified into deprescribing or stable user groups and followed 
      for 2 years or until death or discharge for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. 
      Participants switching treatment groups were censored in the per-protocol 
      analysis. Cognitive function measurements during follow-up were analyzed using an 
      ordinal generalized linear mixed model, adjusting for confounders with inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting. Per-protocol analysis included inverse 
      probability of censoring weighting. Data analyses were performed from May 1, 
      2023, and July 1, 2024. EXPOSURES: Deprescribing was defined as a reduction in 
      the total number of antihypertensive medications or a decrease in medication 
      dosage by 30%, sustained for a minimum of 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Cognitive Function Scale (CFS) was classified as cognitively intact (CFS = 1), 
      mildly impaired (CFS = 2), moderately impaired (CFS = 3), and severely impaired 
      (CFS = 4). RESULTS: Of 45 183 long-term care residents, 12 644 residents (mean 
      [SD] age 77.7 [8.3] years; 329 [2.6%] females and 12 315 [97.4%] males) and 12 
      053 residents (mean [SD] age 77.7 [8.3] years; 314 [2.6%] females and 11 739 
      [97.4%] males) met eligibility for ITT and per-protocol analyses, respectively. 
      At the end of the follow-up, 12.0% of residents had a worsened CFS (higher score) 
      and 7.7% had an improved CFS (lower score) with 10.8% of the deprescribing group 
      and 12.1% of the stable user group showing a worsened CFS score. In the 
      per-protocol analysis, the deprescribing group had a 12% reduction in the odds of 
      progressing to a worse CFS category per 12-week period (odds ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 
      0.78-0.99) compared to the stable user group. Among residents with dementia, 
      deprescribing was associated with 16% reduced odds of cognitive decline (odds 
      ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98). These patterns remained consistent in the ITT 
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study indicates that 
      deprescribing is associated with less cognitive decline in nursing home 
      residents, particularly those with dementia. More data are needed to understand 
      the benefits and harms of antihypertensive deprescribing to inform 
      patient-centered medication management in nursing homes.

PG  - 847-856
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1251 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), such as tiotropium, are 
      inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilators. However, there is limited clinical 
      evidence examining whether LAMAs may have clinically meaningful central 
      anticholinergic effects, such as increased dementia risk. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      the association between tiotropium initiation and dementia risk in older adults 
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This population-based, active-comparator, new-user cohort study 
      used linkable administrative databases from Ontario, Canada, with a target trial 
      emulation framework. The cohort included new users of tiotropium monotherapy or a 
      long-acting β2-agonist plus inhaled corticosteroid (LABA-ICS) who were 66 years 
      or older with COPD and without dementia, from September 4, 2004, to February 29, 
      2012. The follow-up period was up to 10 years from treatment initiation. Analyses 
      were conducted from May 13, 2024, to March 6, 2025. EXPOSURES: Tiotropium 
      monotherapy initiators were compared with LABA-ICS initiators. The primary 
      analysis used an intention-to-treat exposure definition. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Incident dementia was determined using a validated algorithm. A 1-year 
      lag time was implemented to mitigate reverse causality and to account for disease 
      latency. Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) with death as a competing risk were 
      obtained from Cox models with propensity score fine stratification weights. 
      Weighted incidence rate differences (IRDs) per 1000 person-years were calculated. 
      RESULTS: Among 30 960 tiotropium monotherapy initiators and 19 530 LABA-ICS 
      initiators, the mean (SD) age was 75.1 (6.7) years and 46.7% were female. Over a 
      median (IQR) follow-up period of 7.59 (3.91-10.0) years from treatment 
      initiation, tiotropium monotherapy vs LABA-ICS initiation was associated with a 
      small increase in dementia risk per 1000 person-years (incidence rates, 29.6 [95% 
      CI, 28.8-30.4] vs 27.4 [95% CI, 26.4-28.3]; IRD, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.0-3.5]; HR, 1.09 
      [95% CI, 1.04-1.14]). The secondary as-treated analysis showed no significant 
      association per 1000 person-years (incidence rates, 24.1 [95% CI, 22.2-26.0] vs 
      21.4 [95% CI, 18.5-24.3]; IRD, 2.7 [95% CI, -0.8 to 6.1]; HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 
      0.93-1.32]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, among older adults 
      with COPD, the small absolute rate increase in incident dementia associated with 
      tiotropium monotherapy vs LABA-ICS was of questionable clinical importance, 
      particularly when weighed against the established clinical benefits of 
      tiotropium.

      trial emulation using real-world data.
PG  - 476-485
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djae260 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RAs) on pancreatic cancer incidence are limited and inconsistent. Here we 
      evaluate the association of GLP-1RAs, alone and in combinations, with incident 
      pancreatic cancer risk in a real-world population, stratified by obesity and 
      smoking status. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus who were prescribed GLP-1RAs or other nonglucagon-like 
      peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications between January 2013 and 
      March 2019 and had no prior diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The incident 
      (first-time) diagnosis of pancreatic cancer during a 5-year follow-up was 
      compared between propensity-score matched cohorts of patients prescribed GLP-1RAs 
      vs other nonglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications. 
      Subgroup analyses were performed in patients stratified by the status of obesity 
      and tobacco use disorder. We also compared GLP-1RA combination therapies with 
      monotherapies. Time-to-first-event analysis was performed using Cox proportional 
      hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with the hazard ratio and 95% 
      confidence interval calculated. RESULTS: The study population comprised 1 636 056 
      eligible patients including 167 091 prescribed GLP-1RAs and 1 468 965 prescribed 
      other antidiabetes medications. GLP-1RAs were associated with a statistically 
      significant decreased risk for pancreatic cancer incidence compared with each of 
      6 nonglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications with 
      hazard ratios ranging from 0.42 to 0.82. The reduction was greater in patients 
      with obesity and tobacco use disorder than in those without. GLP-1RA combination 
      therapies were associated with lower pancreatic cancer risk compared with 
      monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RAs were associated with reduced pancreatic 
      cancer incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further studies and 
      trials are needed to explore mechanisms and confirm causal effects.

TI  - Effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) on hospitalization among adults with 
      COVID-19: An electronic health record-based target trial emulation from N3C.
PG  - e1004493
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004493 [doi]
LID - e1004493
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid) is indicated for patients with 
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression to severe 
      disease due to the presence of one or more risk factors. Millions of treatment 
      courses have been prescribed in the United States alone. Paxlovid was highly 
      effective at preventing hospitalization and death in clinical trials. Several 
      studies have found a protective association in real-world data, but they 
      variously used less recent study periods, correlational methods, and small, local 
      cohorts. Their estimates also varied widely. The real-world effectiveness of 
      Paxlovid remains uncertain, and it is unknown whether its effect is homogeneous 
      across demographic strata. This study leverages electronic health record data in 
      the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) repository to investigate 
      disparities in Paxlovid treatment and to emulate a target trial assessing its 
      effectiveness in reducing severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This 
      target trial emulation used a cohort of 703,647 patients with COVID-19 seen at 34 
      clinical sites across the United States between April 1, 2022 and August 28, 
      2023. Treatment was defined as receipt of a Paxlovid prescription within 5 days 
      of the patient's COVID-19 index date (positive test or diagnosis). To emulate 
      randomization, we used the clone-censor-weight technique with inverse probability 
      of censoring weights to balance a set of covariates including sex, age, race and 
      ethnicity, comorbidities, community well-being index (CWBI), prior healthcare 
      utilization, month of COVID-19 index, and site of care provision. The primary 
      outcome was hospitalization; death was a secondary outcome. We estimated that 
      Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization by 39% (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      [36%, 41%]; p < 0.001), with an absolute risk reduction of 0.9 percentage points 
      (95% CI [0.9, 1.0]; p < 0.001), and reduced the risk of death by 61% (95% CI 
      [55%, 67%]; p < 0.001), with an absolute risk reduction of 0.2 percentage points 
      (95% CI [0.1, 0.2]; p < 0.001). We also conducted stratified analyses by 
      vaccination status and age group. Absolute risk reduction for hospitalization was 
      similar among patients that were vaccinated and unvaccinate, but was much greater 
      among patients aged 65+ years than among younger patients. We observed 
      disparities in Paxlovid treatment, with lower rates among black and Hispanic or 
      Latino patients, and within socially vulnerable communities. This study's main 
      limitation is that it estimates causal effects using observational data and could 
      be biased by unmeasured confounding. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of Paxlovid's 
      real-world effectiveness, we observed that Paxlovid is effective at preventing 
      hospitalization and death, including among vaccinated patients, and particularly 
      among older patients. This remains true in the era of Severe Acute Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron subvariants. However, disparities in 
      Paxlovid treatment rates imply that the benefit of Paxlovid's effectiveness is 
      not equitably distributed.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors, Dulaglutide, and Risk for Dementia : A 
      Population-Based Cohort Study.
PG  - 1319-1329
LID - 10.7326/M23-3220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may have neuroprotective 
      effects in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, their comparative 
      effectiveness in preventing dementia remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 
      risk for dementia between SGLT2 inhibitors and dulaglutide (a GLP-1 RA). DESIGN: 
      Target trial emulation study. SETTING: Nationwide health care data of South Korea 
      obtained from the National Health Insurance Service between 2010 and 2022. 
      PATIENTS: Patients aged 60 years or older who have T2D and are initiating 
      treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors or dulaglutide. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome 
      was the presumed clinical onset of dementia. The date of onset was defined as the 
      year before the date of dementia diagnosis, assuming that the time between the 
      onset of dementia and diagnosis was 1 year. The 5-year risk ratios and risk 
      differences comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with dulaglutide were estimated in a 1:2 
      propensity score-matched cohort adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 
      12 489 patients initiating SGLT2 inhibitor treatment (51.9% dapagliflozin and 
      48.1% empagliflozin) and 1075 patients initiating dulaglutide treatment were 
      included. In the matched cohort, over a median follow-up of 4.4 years, the 
      primary outcome event occurred in 69 participants in the SGLT2 inhibitor group 
      and 43 in the dulaglutide group. The estimated risk difference was -0.91 
      percentage point (95% CI, -2.45 to 0.63 percentage point), and the estimated risk 
      ratio was 0.81 (CI, 0.56 to 1.16). LIMITATION: Residual confounding is possible; 
      there was no adjustment for hemoglobin A(1c) levels or duration of diabetes; the 
      study is not representative of newer drugs, including more effective GLP-1 RAs; 
      and the onset of dementia was not measured directly. CONCLUSION: Under 
      conventional statistical criteria, a risk for dementia between 2.5 percentage 
      points lower and 0.6 percentage point greater for SGLT2 inhibitors than for 
      dulaglutide was estimated to be highly compatible with the data from this study. 
      However, whether these findings generalize to newer GLP-1 RAs is uncertain. Thus, 
      further studies incorporating newer drugs within these drug classes and better 
      addressing residual confounding are required. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Ministry of 
      Food and Drug Safety of South Korea.

TI  - Challenges in Estimating the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccination Using 
      Observational Data.
PG  - 685-693
LID - 10.7326/M21-4269 [doi]
LID - M21-4269
AB  - The COVID-19 vaccines were developed and rigorously evaluated in randomized 
      trials during 2020. However, important questions, such as the magnitude and 
      duration of protection, their effectiveness against new virus variants, and the 
      effectiveness of booster vaccination, could not be answered by randomized trials 
      and have therefore been addressed in observational studies. Analyses of 
      observational data can be biased because of confounding and because of inadequate 
      design that does not consider the evolution of the pandemic over time and the 
      rapid uptake of vaccination. Emulating a hypothetical "target trial" using 
      observational data assembled during vaccine rollouts can help manage such 
      potential sources of bias. This article describes 2 approaches to target trial 
      emulation. In the sequential approach, on each day, eligible persons who have not 
      yet been vaccinated are matched to a vaccinated person. The single-trial approach 
      sets a single baseline at the start of the rollout and considers vaccination as a 
      time-varying variable. The nature of the confounding depends on the analysis 
      strategy: Estimating "per-protocol" effects (accounting for vaccination of 
      initially unvaccinated persons after baseline) may require adjustment for both 
      baseline and "time-varying" confounders. These issues are illustrated by using 
      observational data from 2 780 931 persons in the United Kingdom aged 70 years or 
      older to estimate the effect of a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Addressing 
      the issues discussed in this article should help authors of observational studies 
      provide robust evidence to guide clinical and policy decisions.

TI  - Estimated Effect of Parathyroidectomy on Long-Term Kidney Function in Adults With 
      Primary Hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 624-631
LID - 10.7326/M22-2222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary guidelines recommend parathyroidectomy to slow the 
      progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with primary 
      hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
      less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Limited data address the effect of 
      parathyroidectomy on long-term kidney function. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 
      incidence of a sustained decline in eGFR of at least 50% among patients with PHPT 
      treated with parathyroidectomy versus nonoperative management. DESIGN: Target 
      trial emulation was done using observational data from adults with PHPT, using an 
      extended Cox model with time-varying inverse probability weighting. SETTING: 
      Veterans Health Administration. PATIENTS: Patients with a new biochemical 
      diagnosis of PHPT in 2000 to 2019. MEASUREMENTS: Sustained decline of at least 
      50% from pretreatment eGFR. RESULTS: Among 43 697 patients with PHPT (mean age, 
      66.8 years), 2928 (6.7%) had a decline of at least 50% in eGFR over a median 
      follow-up of 4.9 years. The weighted cumulative incidence of eGFR decline was 
      5.1% at 5 years and 10.8% at 10 years in patients managed with parathyroidectomy, 
      compared with 5.1% and 12.0%, respectively, in those managed nonoperatively. The 
      adjusted hazard of eGFR decline did not differ between parathyroidectomy and 
      nonoperative management (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.16]). 
      Subgroup analyses found no heterogeneity of treatment effect based on 
      pretreatment kidney function. Parathyroidectomy was associated with a reduced 
      hazard of the primary outcome among patients younger than 60 years (HR, 0.75 [CI, 
      0.59 to 0.93]) that was not evident among those aged 60 years or older (HR, 1.08 
      [CI, 0.87 to 1.34]). LIMITATION: Analyses were done in a predominantly male 
      cohort using observational data. CONCLUSION: Parathyroidectomy had no effect on 
      long-term kidney function in older adults with PHPT. Potential benefits related 
      to kidney function should not be the primary consideration for PHPT treatment 
      decisions. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institute on Aging.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Individual Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 
      Inhibitors.
PG  - 302-313
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.7357 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Evidence on cardiovascular benefits and safety of sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors is mainly from placebo-controlled trials. 
      Therefore, the comparative effectiveness and safety of individual SGLT-2 
      inhibitors remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of canagliflozin or 
      dapagliflozin with empagliflozin for a composite outcome (myocardial infarction 
      [MI] or stroke), heart failure hospitalization, MI, stroke, all-cause death, and 
      safety outcomes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), lower-limb amputation, 
      bone fracture, severe urinary tract infection (UTI), and genital infection and 
      whether effects differed by dosage or cardiovascular disease (CVD) history. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study using 
      target trial emulation included adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using 3 US 
      claims databases using data from August 2014 through June 2020. The study was 
      conducted from August 2023 to July 2024, with a follow-up period of up to 8 
      years, and the analysis was completed in July 2024. EXPOSURES: First dispensing 
      of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin without any use of SGLT-2 
      inhibitors during the prior 365 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Database-specific models were weighted using propensity score matching-weights to 
      adjust for 129 confounders. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for outcomes were estimated 
      using weighted Cox proportional hazards models. HRs were pooled across databases 
      using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: : Across the databases, 232 890 
      patients receiving canagliflozin, 129 881 patients receiving dapagliflozin, and 
      295 043 patients receiving empagliflozin were identified. Compared with 
      empagliflozin initiators, those receiving canagliflozin or dapagliflozin were 
      less likely to have diabetes-related conditions or a history of CVD at baseline. 
      For MI/stroke risk, both canagliflozin (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.05) and 
      dapagliflozin (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89-1.03) were comparable to empagliflozin. For 
      heart failure hospitalization, dapagliflozin initiators had a higher risk (HR, 
      1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39), particularly at the low dose of 5 mg (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 
      1.12-1.50). These findings were consistent across subgroups of CVD history. For 
      safety events, compared with empagliflozin, canagliflozin initiators had a lower 
      risk of genital infections (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.97) but a higher risk of 
      severe UTIs (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24), and dapagliflozin initiators had lower 
      risks of genital infections (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.95) and DKA (HR, 0.78; 95% 
      CI, 0.68-0.90). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that individual 
      SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated comparable cardiovascular effectiveness at 
      clinically effective doses, though low-dose dapagliflozin showed a reduced 
      benefit for heart failure hospitalization compared with empagliflozin.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Current guidelines suggest treating poor-prognosis eosinophilic 
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) with a combination of glucocorticoids 
      (GCs) plus cyclophosphamide (CYC). However, there is little data to support the 
      need for the addition of CYC. The objective of this study was to compare GCs plus 
      CYC to GCs alone as induction therapy in poor-prognosis EGPA. METHODS: We 
      emulated a target trial using observational data from a European multicenter 
      retrospective database. We included patients with newly diagnosed EGPA with a 
      1996 Five Factor Score (FFS) of at least 1, treated with GCs or GCs plus CYC 
      between June 1985 and November 2018. Propensity score analysis was used to adjust 
      for potential confounders. Primary outcome was relapse at 12months. Secondary 
      outcomes included major relapse at 12months and GC-dependent asthma and/or ear 
      nose and throat (ENT) manifestations at 24months. RESULTS: A total of 209 
      patients were included: 47 % were male and the mean age at diagnosis was 52 (±16 
      years); 26 % were treated with GCs alone and 74 % with GCs plus CYC. After 
      adjustment, the risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.24, 95%CI [0.08-0.67], 
      p = 0.007), major relapse (HR: 0.24, 95%CI [0.07-0.85], p = 0.026) and the 
      proportion of GC-dependent asthma and/or ENT manifestations (odds ratio:0.30, 
      95%CI [0.14-0.66], p = 0.003) were lower in the GCs plus CYC group compared to 
      the GCs alone group. CONCLUSION: This target trial emulation study shows that the 
      addition of CYC to GCs reduces the risk of vasculitis relapse and the rate of 
      GC-dependent asthma and/or ENT manifestations in patients with poor-prognosis 
      EGPA.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Baricitinib Versus Tocilizumab in Hospitalized 
      Patients With COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study of the National Covid 
      Collaborative.
PG  - e29-e41
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000006444 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 treatment guidelines recommend baricitinib or tocilizumab 
      for the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We compared the 
      effectiveness of baricitinib vs. tocilizumab on mortality and clinical outcomes 
      among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, 
      propensity-weighted cohort study using a target trial emulation approach. 
      SETTING: The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which is the largest 
      electronic health records data on COVID-19 in the United States. The setting 
      included 75 hospitals. PATIENTS: Adults who were hospitalized for COVID-19. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Newly initiated on baricitinib or tocilizumab. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: Our primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We used propensity scores 
      with inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) to control bias and 
      confounding while comparing treatments. Among 10,661 individuals included in the 
      study, 6,229 (58.4%) received baricitinib and 4,432 (41.6%) tocilizumab. Overall, 
      the mean age of the cohort was 60.0 ± 15.1 years, 6429 (60.3%) were male, and 
      19.2% received invasive mechanical ventilation. After IPTW adjustment, 
      baricitinib use was associated with lower 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 
      0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98) and hospital (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.94) mortality 
      compared with tocilizumab. Baricitinib was also associated with shorter hospital 
      length of stay (incident rate ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.94) and lower rates of 
      hospital-acquired infections (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99), although no 
      difference in ICU length of stay was noted between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In this large, diverse cohort of U.S. hospitalized adults with COVID-19, 
      baricitinib was associated with significantly lower 28-day mortality, hospital 
      mortality, shorter hospital length of stay, and less hospital-acquired infections 
      compared with tocilizumab.

      Administration Nursing Home Residents.
PG  - 661-669
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.0507 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Limited evidence exists on the association between initiation of 
      antihypertensive medication and risk of fractures in older long-term nursing home 
      residents. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between antihypertensive 
      medication initiation and risk of fracture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This was a retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation for data 
      derived from 29 648 older long-term care nursing home residents in the Veterans 
      Health Administration (VA) from January 1, 2006, to October 31, 2019. Data were 
      analyzed from December 1, 2021, to November 11, 2023. EXPOSURE: Episodes of 
      antihypertensive medication initiation were identified, and eligible initiation 
      episodes were matched with comparable controls who did not initiate therapy. MAIN 
      OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was nontraumatic fracture of the 
      humerus, hip, pelvis, radius, or ulna within 30 days of antihypertensive 
      medication initiation. Results were computed among subgroups of residents with 
      dementia, across systolic and diastolic blood pressure thresholds of 140 and 80 
      mm Hg, respectively, and with use of prior antihypertensive therapies. Analyses 
      were adjusted for more than 50 baseline covariates using 1:4 propensity score 
      matching. RESULTS: Data from 29 648 individuals were included in this study (mean 
      [SD] age, 78.0 [8.4] years; 28 952 [97.7%] male). In the propensity score-matched 
      cohort of 64 710 residents (mean [SD] age, 77.9 [8.5] years), the incidence rate 
      of fractures per 100 person-years in residents initiating antihypertensive 
      medication was 5.4 compared with 2.2 in the control arm. This finding 
      corresponded to an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.42 (95% CI, 1.43-4.08) and an 
      adjusted excess risk per 100 person-years of 3.12 (95% CI, 0.95-6.78). 
      Antihypertensive medication initiation was also associated with higher risk of 
      severe falls requiring hospitalizations or emergency department visits (HR, 1.80 
      [95% CI, 1.53-2.13]) and syncope (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.30-2.19]). The magnitude of 
      fracture risk was numerically higher among subgroups of residents with dementia 
      (HR, 3.28 [95% CI, 1.76-6.10]), systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher 
      (HR, 3.12 [95% CI, 1.71-5.69]), diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or higher 
      (HR, 4.41 [95% CI, 1.67-11.68]), and no recent antihypertensive medication use 
      (HR, 4.77 [95% CI, 1.49-15.32]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings indicated 
      that initiation of antihypertensive medication was associated with elevated risks 
      of fractures and falls. These risks were numerically higher among residents with 
      dementia, higher baseline blood pressures values, and no recent antihypertensive 
      medication use. Caution and additional monitoring are advised when initiating 
      antihypertensive medication in this vulnerable population.

TI  - Risk of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in patients with psoriasis 
      treated with biologics: a nationwide study using a target trial emulation 
      framework.
PG  - 105-114
LID - 10.1093/bjd/ljaf101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with psoriasis have a higher baseline risk of herpes zoster 
      (HZ) than the general population. This has raised concerns that tumour necrosis 
      factor (TNF)-α inhibitor use may be associated with an increased risk of HZ. 
      However, the risk profiles for newer biologics, including interleukin (IL)-17, 
      IL-12/23 and IL-23 inhibitors, remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To compare the risks 
      of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in patients with psoriasis using different 
      biologics (ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab, etanercept and 
      adalimumab) vs. traditional systemic treatments (TSTs). METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance 
      Research Database (2011-2021). We included patients with psoriasis or psoriatic 
      arthritis aged ≥ 20 years who had been treated with biologics or TSTs for at 
      least 6 months. We classified patients by individual biologics or TST and 
      followed them for up to 2.5 years from drug initiation until the occurrence of 
      outcome events or death. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of HZ. We used 
      inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for covariates, including 
      patient age, sex, comorbidities and comedications. We used Cox proportional 
      hazards models to evaluate the risk of HZ with different biologics. RESULTS: We 
      identified 815, 1870, 1095, 2327, 261, 303 and 98 patients with psoriasis who 
      were taking etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, 
      brodalumab and guselkumab, respectively. Compared with patients receiving TSTs, 
      for those receiving ustekinumab and guselkumab the risk of HZ trended lower 
      [ustekinumab: weighted hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.61-1.11; guselkumab: weighted HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22-1.02], while for those 
      receiving adalimumab it was statistically significantly higher (weighted HR 1.63, 
      95% CI 1.22-2.18). Additionally, ustekinumab was associated with a reduced risk 
      of PHN (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.64). There were no statistically significant 
      differences in the risk of HZ between TSTs and either etanercept, secukinumab, 
      ixekizumab or brodalumab. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ustekinumab and 
      guselkumab may be associated with a reduced risk of HZ and PHN vs. TSTs in 
      patients with psoriasis. This study could have significance for real-world 
      practice.

OAB - Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition. It affects around 2% to 3% of people 
      globally. People with psoriasis can have itchy and painful raised patches on 
      their skin. The development of drugs called ‘biologics’ has changed how we treat 
      psoriasis. Some people taking biologics experience complete clearance of their 
      psoriasis. Biologics work by suppressing the immune system. There are concerns 
      about infections like ‘herpes zoster’ when taking biologics. Herpes zoster is 
      also known as ‘shingles’. Shingles results when the virus that causes chickenpox 
      reactivates. As well as skin infections, shingles can cause nerve pain. Other 
      complications include specific eye and brain infections. Giving patients the 
      shingles vaccine before they take biologics is important. We investigated the 
      link between shingles and biologics in people with psoriasis. The biologics 
      studied were ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab, etanercept and 
      adalimumab. We used a national database in Taiwan to compare patients with 
      psoriasis taking biologics to those on other treatment. The database covers 99% 
      of Taiwan's population (approximately 23 million people). Patients on adalimumab 
      were at higher risk of shingles than people on other treatment. People on 
      ustekinumab or guselkumab were at less risk of shingles and nerve pain. Some 
      biologics may lower the risk of shingles and nerve pain versus other treatments. 
      This could be important for treating people with psoriasis.

      2023 to March, 2024: a target trial emulation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines have been approved in 
      the USA for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in 
      adults aged 60 years and older. Information on the real-world effectiveness of 
      these vaccines is needed. METHODS: We used electronic health records in the 
      Veterans Health Administration to emulate a target trial comparing a single dose 
      of a recombinant stabilised prefusion F protein RSV vaccine versus no vaccination 
      among veterans aged 60 years and older. We matched eligible vaccine recipients 
      with up to four unvaccinated individuals in four monthly nested sequential trials 
      from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2023. Outcomes were ascertained up to March 31, 2024. The 
      primary outcome was any positive RSV test from day 14 following the matched index 
      date. Secondary outcomes included hospitalisation and emergency department or 
      urgent care encounter occurring within 1 day before or after a positive RSV test. 
      We estimated vaccine effectiveness as 100 × (1 - risk ratio). FINDINGS: We 
      included 146 852 vaccinated individuals matched to 582 936 unique control 
      individuals, weighted equally to represent 146 852 individuals. Across the two 
      groups, 276 039 (94·0%) of 293 704 veterans were male, 17 665 (6·0%) were female, 
      and median age was 75·9 years (IQR 71·7-79·7). Over a median follow-up of 124 
      days (IQR 102-150), the incidence rate of documented RSV infection was 1·7 (95% 
      CI 1·4-2·1) events per 1000 person-years (88 total events) in the vaccinated 
      group and 7·3 (6·6-8·1) per 1000 person-years in the unvaccinated group (372 
      total events), and vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 78·1% (72·6-83·5). 
      Among the secondary outcomes, vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 78·7% 
      (72·2-84·8) against RSV-associated emergency department or urgent care 
      encounters, and 80·3% (65·8-90·1) against RSV-associated hospitalisation. 
      INTERPRETATION: RSV vaccination was effective in preventing RSV-related illness, 
      including associated health-care use, in adults aged 60 years and older during 
      the 2023-24 respiratory illness season, supporting current recommendations for 
      vaccination in this population. FUNDING: US Department of Veterans Affairs

TI  - Medication-Induced Weight Change Across Common Antidepressant Treatments : A 
      Target Trial Emulation Study.
PG  - 993-1003
LID - 10.7326/M23-2742 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antidepressants are among the most commonly prescribed medications, 
      but evidence on comparative weight change for specific first-line treatments is 
      limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare weight change across common first-line 
      antidepressant treatments by emulating a target trial. DESIGN: Observational 
      cohort study over 24 months. SETTING: Electronic health record (EHR) data from 
      2010 to 2019 across 8 U.S. health systems. PARTICIPANTS: 183 118 patients. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Prescription data determined initiation of treatment with 
      sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, 
      duloxetine, or venlafaxine. The investigators estimated the population-level 
      effects of initiating each treatment, relative to sertraline, on mean weight 
      change (primary) and the probability of gaining at least 5% of baseline weight 
      (secondary) 6 months after initiation. Inverse probability weighting of repeated 
      outcome marginal structural models was used to account for baseline confounding 
      and informative outcome measurement. In secondary analyses, the effects of 
      initiating and adhering to each treatment protocol were estimated. RESULTS: 
      Compared with that for sertraline, estimated 6-month weight gain was higher for 
      escitalopram (difference, 0.41 kg [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52 kg]), paroxetine 
      (difference, 0.37 kg [CI, 0.20 to 0.54 kg]), duloxetine (difference, 0.34 kg [CI, 
      0.22 to 0.44 kg]), venlafaxine (difference, 0.17 kg [CI, 0.03 to 0.31 kg]), and 
      citalopram (difference, 0.12 kg [CI, 0.02 to 0.23 kg]); similar for fluoxetine 
      (difference, -0.07 kg [CI, -0.19 to 0.04 kg]); and lower for bupropion 
      (difference, -0.22 kg [CI, -0.33 to -0.12 kg]). Escitalopram, paroxetine, and 
      duloxetine were associated with 10% to 15% higher risk for gaining at least 5% of 
      baseline weight, whereas bupropion was associated with 15% reduced risk. When the 
      effects of initiation and adherence were estimated, associations were stronger 
      but had wider CIs. Six-month adherence ranged from 28% (duloxetine) to 41% 
      (bupropion). LIMITATION: No data on medication dispensing, low medication 
      adherence, incomplete data on adherence, and incomplete data on weight measures 
      across time points. CONCLUSION: Small differences in mean weight change were 
      found between 8 first-line antidepressants, with bupropion consistently showing 
      the least weight gain, although adherence to medications over follow-up was low. 
      Clinicians could consider potential weight gain when initiating antidepressant 
      treatment. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institutes of Health.

TI  - Impact of Integrase Inhibitors on Cardiovascular Disease Events in People With 
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus Starting Antiretroviral Therapy.
PG  - 729-737
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciad286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been associated 
      with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We investigated 
      the impact of starting INSTI-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) on CVD events 
      among treatment-naïve people with human immunodeficiency virus using a target 
      trial framework, which reduces the potential for confounding and selection bias. 
      METHODS: We included Swiss HIV Cohort Study participants who were ART-naïve after 
      May 2008, when INSTIs became available in Switzerland. Individuals were 
      categorized according to their first ART regimen (INSTI vs other ART) and were 
      followed from ART start until the first of CVD event (myocardial infarction, 
      stroke, or invasive cardiovascular procedure), loss to follow-up, death, or last 
      cohort visit. We calculated hazard ratios and risk differences using pooled 
      logistic regression models with inverse probability of treatment and censoring 
      weights. RESULTS: Of 5362 participants (median age 38 years, 21% women, 15% of 
      African origin), 1837 (34.3%) started INSTI-based ART, and 3525 (65.7%) started 
      other ART. Within 4.9 years (interquartile range, 2.4-7.4), 116 CVD events 
      occurred. Starting INSTI-based ART was not associated with an increased risk for 
      CVD events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], .46-1.39). 
      Adjusted risk differences between individuals who started INSTIs and those who 
      started other ART were -0.17% (95% CI, -.37 to .19) after 1 year, -0.61% (-1.54 
      to 0.22) after 5 years, and -0.71% (-2.16 to 0.94) after 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this target trial emulation, we found no difference in short- or long-term risk 
      for CVD events between treatment-naïve people with human immunodeficiency virus 
      who started INSTI-based ART and those on other ART.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An Informatics Consult has been proposed in which clinicians request 
      novel evidence from large scale health data resources, tailored to the treatment 
      of a specific patient. However, the availability of such consultations is 
      lacking. We seek to provide an Informatics Consult for a situation where a 
      treatment indication and contraindication coexist in the same patient, i.e., 
      anti-coagulation use for stroke prevention in a patient with both atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and liver cirrhosis. METHODS: We examined four sources of 
      evidence for the effect of warfarin on stroke risk or all-cause mortality from: 
      (1) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), (2) meta-analysis of prior observational 
      studies, (3) trial emulation (using population electronic health records 
      (N = 3,854,710) and (4) genetic evidence (Mendelian randomisation). We developed 
      prototype forms to request an Informatics Consult and return of results in 
      electronic health record systems. RESULTS: We found 0 RCT reports and 0 trials 
      recruiting for patients with AF and cirrhosis. We found broad concordance across 
      the three new sources of evidence we generated. Meta-analysis of prior 
      observational studies showed that warfarin use was associated with lower stroke 
      risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71, CI 0.39-1.29). In a target trial emulation, 
      warfarin was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.61, CI 0.49-0.76) 
      and ischaemic stroke (HR = 0.27, CI 0.08-0.91). Mendelian randomisation served as 
      a drug target validation where we found that lower levels of vitamin K1 (warfarin 
      is a vitamin K1 antagonist) are associated with lower stroke risk. A pilot survey 
      with an independent sample of 34 clinicians revealed that 85% of clinicians found 
      information on prognosis useful and that 79% thought that they should have access 
      to the Informatics Consult as a service within their healthcare systems. We 
      identified candidate steps for automation to scale evidence generation and to 
      accelerate the return of results. CONCLUSION: We performed a proof-of-concept 
      Informatics Consult for evidence generation, which may inform treatment decisions 
      in situations where there is dearth of randomised trials. Patients are surprised 
      to know that their clinicians are currently not able to learn in clinic from data 
      on 'patients like me'. We identify the key challenges in offering such an 
      Informatics Consult as a service.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Real-world studies on its effectiveness in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of the live zoster vaccine in patients with T2DM more than 10 
      years. METHODS: In this target trial emulation study, we utilized a large-scale, 
      nationwide cohort in South Korea, consisting of individuals aged 50 years and 
      older with T2DM from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2021 (n = 934 945). This 
      cohort was integrated using health insurance data from the Korea Health Insurance 
      Review and Assessment Service, national health screening results from the Korean 
      National Health Insurance Service, and live zoster vaccination data from the 
      Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Vaccine effectiveness in preventing 
      herpes zoster (HZ), postherpetic neuralgia, and hospital admissions for HZ based 
      on International Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes was evaluated in 
      patients with T2DM. In a propensity score-based overlap weighted cohort, Cox 
      proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the adjusted hazard ratios 
      (aHRs) and 95% CIs for the effectiveness of the live zoster vaccine among 
      patients with T2DM. RESULTS: After propensity score-based overlap weighting, 253 
      660 patients with T2DM were included (mean age, 62.4 years [standard deviation, 
      2.3 years]; 138 338 males, 54.5%). Live zoster vaccination was associated with a 
      reduced risk of HZ (aHR 0.59 [95% CI: 0.57-0.61]), postherpetic neuralgia (aHR 
      0.59 [95% CI: 0.57-0.61]), and hospital admissions for HZ (aHR 0.41 [95% CI: 
      0.36-0.47]). Vaccine effectiveness was highest within the first-year 
      post-vaccination, with a sustained protective effect lasting up to 6 years. 
      Furthermore, the effectiveness was greater in the non-insulin treatment group 
      compared with the insulin treatment group. DISCUSSION: Our target trial 
      highlighted that live zoster vaccination significantly reduced the risk of HZ, 
      postherpetic neuralgia, and hospital admissions in patients with T2DM. However, 
      its effectiveness was attenuated in those undergoing insulin treatment.

TI  - Target Trial Emulation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 
      Infection Versus No Infection and Risk of Post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      Conditions in the Omicron Variant Versus Prior Eras.
LID - ciaf087 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been linked to the 
      development of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCCs). We investigated whether severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases the 
      risk of selected PCCs or death up to 1 year after infection, separately in the 
      wild-type (WT), Alpha-transition, Delta, and Omicron eras and by vaccination 
      status. METHODS: We used health records of the Veterans Health Administration to 
      emulate a hypothetical target trial of SARS-CoV-2 infection versus no infection. 
      Veterans who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 2020 and April 2022 (n 
      = 430 160) were matched 1:1 to veterans who had not tested positive for 
      SARS-CoV-2. All-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of 32 potential PCCs 
      were ascertained at 31-180 and 181-365 days after infection or matched index 
      date. RESULTS: From 31 to 180 days, the cumulative incidence of death and all 
      organ-level PCCs was greater in infected versus uninfected participants, with 
      cumulative incidence differences lower in the Omicron than in the WT era and 
      lower in vaccinated than in unvaccinated persons. In the Omicron era, the 
      cumulative incidence of death and most PCCs from day 181-365 were higher in 
      infected than in uninfected participants only among unvaccinated but not among 
      vaccinated persons. CONCLUSIONS: Excess burden of PCCs and mortality persisted 
      31-180 days after infection in the Omicron era, albeit at a lower level than in 
      the WT and Delta eras. Excess burden of mortality and most PCCs was much lower 
      181-365 days after infection and was observed in the Omicron era only among 
      unvaccinated persons, suggesting a protective effect of vaccination.

TI  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and risk of chronic kidney 
      disease-mineral and bone disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
      stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease.
PG  - E178-E189
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.240922 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve renal outcomes, 
      but may transiently affect biochemical markers of CKD-mineral and bone disorders 
      (CKD-MBD). We sought to evaluate the long-term risk of CKD-MBD associated with 
      use of SGLT2 inhibitors in this patient population. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective cohort study, employing a target trial emulation framework and 
      using electronic medical records of patients from 9 hospitals in Taiwan 
      (2016-2023). We included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1-3 CKD 
      who had newly started either an SGLT2 inhibitor or, as a comparison group, a 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). The primary outcome was a 
      composite of incident biochemical abnormalities (serum phosphate > 1.5 mmol/L, 
      serum calcium < 2.1 mmol/L, serum intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] > 6.9 pmol/L, 
      or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 49.9 nmol/L). RESULTS: The cohort included 13 379 
      patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 11 920) or GLP-1 RAs (n = 1459) with a 
      median follow-up of 3.3 years. Compared with GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors were 
      associated with a lower cumulative incidence of the composite primary outcome 
      (hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.86), 
      hyperphosphatemia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.91), hypocalcemia (HR 0.82, 95% CI 
      0.78-0.86), high serum iPTH levels (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.78), and low serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90). INTERPRETATION: Use of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a lower incidence of biochemical 
      abnormalities related to CKD-MBD than GLP-1 RAs. These agents may be considered 
      to reduce risk of CKD-MBD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1-3 
      CKD.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors vs Sulfonylureas for Gout Prevention 
      Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Receiving Metformin.
PG  - 650-660
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.0376 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a 
      revolutionary treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with cardiovascular, kidney, 
      and serum urate-lowering benefits. OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of incident gout 
      and rate of recurrent flares between patients with T2D initiating SGLT2i vs 
      sulfonylurea, most common second-line glucose-lowering therapy, when added to 
      metformin monotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This sequential, 
      propensity score-matched, new-user comparative effectiveness study using target 
      trial emulation framework included adults with T2D receiving metformin 
      monotherapy in a Canadian general population database from January 1, 2014, to 
      June 30, 2022. EXPOSURES: Initiation of SGLT2i vs sulfonylurea. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was incident gout diagnosis, ascertained by 
      emergency department (ED), hospital, outpatient, and medication dispensing 
      records. Secondary outcomes were gout-primary hospitalizations and ED visits and 
      major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), as well as recurrent flare rates 
      among prevalent gout patients. Heart failure (HF) hospitalization was assessed as 
      positive control outcome and osteoarthritis encounters as negative control. For 
      target trial emulations, we used Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regressions 
      with 1:1 propensity score matching (primary analysis) and overlap weighting 
      (sensitivity analysis). The analysis was conducted from September to December, 
      2023. RESULTS: Among 34 604 propensity score matched adults with T2D initiating 
      SGLT2i or sulfonylurea (20 816 [60%] male, mean [SD] age, 60 [12.4] years), 
      incidence of gout was lower among SGLT2i initiators (4.27 events per 1000 
      person-years) than sulfonylurea initiators (6.91 events per 1000 person-years), 
      with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.48-0.80) and a rate difference (RD) 
      of -2.64 (95% CI, -3.99 to -1.29) per 1000 person-years. Associations persisted 
      regardless of sex, age, or baseline diuretic use. SGLT2i use was also associated 
      with fewer recurrent flares among gout patients (rate ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 
      0.55-0.82; and RD, -20.9; 95% CI, -31.9 to -10.0 per 1000 person-years). HR and 
      RD for MACE associated with SGLT2i use were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77-0.98) and -3.58 
      (95% CI, -6.19 to -0.96) per 1000 person-years. For control outcomes, SGLT2i 
      users had lower risk of HF (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.76), as expected, with no 
      difference in osteoarthritis (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.94-1.34). Results were similar 
      when applying propensity score overlap weighting. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      population-based cohort study, the gout and cardiovascular benefits associated 
      with SGLT2i in these target trial emulations may guide selection of 
      glucose-lowering therapy in patients with T2D, at risk for or already with gout.

TI  - Comparative Cardiovascular Effectiveness of Empagliflozin Versus Dapagliflozin in 
      Adults With Treated Type 2 Diabetes: A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 1401-1411
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.068613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin have proven cardiovascular benefits 
      in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, but their comparative 
      effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: This study used nationwide, population-based 
      Danish health registries to emulate a hypothetical target trial comparing 
      empagliflozin versus dapagliflozin initiation, in addition to standard care, 
      among people with treated type 2 diabetes from 2014 through 2020. The outcome was 
      a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure (HF), or 
      cardiovascular death (major adverse cardiovascular event). Participants were 
      followed until an outcome, emigration, or death occurred; 6 years after 
      initiation; or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first. Logistic regression 
      was used to compute inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights, 
      controlling for 57 potential confounders. In intention-to-treat analyses, 6-year 
      adjusted risks, risk differences, and risk ratios, considering noncardiovascular 
      death competing events, were estimated. Analyses were stratified by coexisting 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and HF. A per-protocol design was 
      performed as a secondary analysis. RESULTS: There were 36 670 eligible 
      empagliflozin and 20 606 eligible dapagliflozin initiators. In the 
      intention-to-treat analysis, the adjusted 6-year absolute risk of major adverse 
      cardiovascular event was not different between empagliflozin and dapagliflozin 
      initiators (10.0% versus 10.0%; risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -0.9% to 1.0%]; 
      risk ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.11]). The findings were consistent in people 
      with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (risk difference, -2.3% [95% CI, 
      -8.2% to 3.5%]; risk ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.14]) and without 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (risk difference, 0.3% [95% CI, -0.6% to 
      1.2%]; risk ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.16]) and in people with HF (risk 
      difference, 1.1% [95% CI, -6.5% to 8.6%]; risk ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.79 to 
      1.37]) and without HF (risk difference, -0.1% [95% CI, -1.0% to 0.8%]; risk 
      ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.09]). The 6-year risks of major adverse 
      cardiovascular event were also not different in the per-protocol analysis (9.1% 
      versus 8.8%; risk difference, 0.2% [95% CI, -2.1% to 2.5%]; risk ratio, 1.03 [95% 
      CI, 0.80 to 1.32]). CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin initiators had 
      no differences in 6-year cardiovascular outcomes in adults with treated type 2 
      diabetes with or without coexisting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or HF.

TI  - Effectiveness of post-COVID-19 primary care attendance in improving survival in 
      very old patients with multimorbidity: a territory-wide target trial emulation.
LID - 10.1136/fmch-2024-002834 [doi]
LID - e002834
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Older individuals with multimorbidity are at an elevated risk of 
      infection and complications from COVID-19. Effectiveness of post-COVID-19 
      interventions or care models in reducing subsequent adverse outcomes in these 
      individuals have rarely been examined. This study aims to examine the 
      effectiveness of attending general outpatient within 30 days after discharge from 
      COVID-19 on 1-year survival among older adults aged 85 years or above with 
      multimorbidity. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study emulating a randomised target 
      trial using electronic health records. SETTING: We used data from the Hospital 
      Authority and the Department of Health in Hong Kong, which provided comprehensive 
      electronic health records, COVID-19 confirmed case data, population-based 
      vaccination records and other individual characteristics for the study. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 85 years or above with multimorbidity who were 
      discharged after hospitalisation for COVID-19 between January 2020 and August 
      2022. INTERVENTIONS: Attending a general outpatient within 30 days of last 
      COVID-19 discharge defined the exposure, compared to no outpatient visit. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality within one year. 
      Secondary outcomes included mortality from respiratory, cardiovascular and cancer 
      causes. RESULTS: A total of 6183 eligible COVID-19 survivors were included in the 
      analysis. The all-cause mortality rate following COVID-19 hospitalisation was 
      lower in the general outpatient visit group (17.1 deaths per 100 person-year) 
      compared with non-visit group (42.8 deaths per 100 person-year). After 
      adjustment, primary care consultations within 30 days after discharge were 
      associated with a significantly greater 1-year survival (difference in 1-year 
      survival: 11.2%, 95% CI 8.1% to 14.4%). We also observed significantly better 
      survival from respiratory diseases in the general outpatient visit group 
      (difference in 1-year survival: 6.3%, 95% CI 3.5% to 8.9%). In a sensitivity 
      analysis for different grace period lengths, we found that the earlier 
      participants had a general outpatient visit after COVID-19 discharge, the better 
      the survival. CONCLUSIONS: Timely primary care consultations after COVID-19 
      hospitalisation may improve survival following COVID-19 hospitalisation among 
      older adults aged 85 or above with multimorbidity. Expanding primary care 
      services and implementing follow-up mechanisms are crucial to support this 
      vulnerable population's recovery and well-being.

TI  - Left ventricular unloading during extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a 
      target trial emulation of the ELSO registry.
PG  - 186
LID - 10.1186/s13054-025-05345-3 [doi]
LID - 186
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
      (ECPR) are at risk of left ventricular distention and complications. There is 
      emerging evidence that concurrent mechanical left ventricular (LV) unloading 
      (e.g. an intra-aortic balloon pump, or microaxial left ventricular assist device) 
      may improve survival. Despite this, there are no large, well-conducted studies 
      investigating the impact of LV unloading on outcomes in ECPR. METHODS: We queried 
      the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) registry between 2020 and 
      2023, and used an emulated target trial framework to investigate the association 
      between concurrent mechanical left ventricular unloading and outcomes in patients 
      receiving ECPR. We imputed missing data using multiple imputation with chained 
      equations, and identified potential confounders implicated in the causal pathway 
      between ECPR and survival time up to 90 days (primary outcome). We used 
      propensity score-matching to adjust for potential confounders, and analysed the 
      primary outcome using a Cox proportional hazards model. We then emulated further 
      target trials based on the inclusion criteria of prior ECPR RCTs to assess 
      whether concurrent unloading was associated with better outcomes based on these 
      criteria. Secondary outcomes included complications from ECPR as classified by 
      ELSO, and survival with favourable functional outcome defined as a Cerebral 
      Performance Category (CPC) 1-2. RESULTS: Of the 3,215 patients included in our 
      analysis, we matched 621 pairs of patients who did and did not receive LV 
      unloading. There were no significant differences in survival time between both 
      groups (HR 0.92, 95%-CI 0.79-1.08), nor survival with favourable functional 
      outcomes (OR 1.15, 95%-CI 0.67-1.99). This was concordant across several 
      sensitivity analyses. Of note, LV unloading was associated with a higher rate of 
      renal (OR 1.55, 95%-CI 1.16-2.07) and cardiovascular (OR 1.60, 95%-CI 1.14-2.26) 
      complications. LV unloading was also associated with central nervous system 
      bleeding (OR 1.75, 95%-CI 1.03-2.96), arrhythmias (OR 1.56, 95%-CI 1.04-2.36), 
      and haemolysis (OR 1.85, 95%-CI 1.10-3.09). CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular 
      unloading was not associated with improved survival in the context of ECPR and 
      may increase complication rates. Randomised data are required to confirm these 
      findings.

TI  - Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters Against Infection, 
      Hospitalization, and Death: A Target Trial Emulation in the Omicron (B.1.1.529) 
      Variant Era.
PG  - 1693-1706
LID - 10.7326/M22-1856 [doi]
LID - M22-1856
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of a third mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (booster 
      dose) against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is uncertain, especially in older, 
      high-risk populations. OBJECTIVE: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death in the Omicron era 
      by booster type, primary vaccine type, time since primary vaccination, age, and 
      comorbidity burden. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study designed to 
      emulate a target trial of booster vaccination versus no booster, conducted from 1 
      December 2021 to 31 March 2022. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
      health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who had received 2 mRNA COVID-19 
      vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier. INTERVENTION: Booster monovalent mRNA 
      vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 or Moderna's mRNA-1273) versus no 
      booster. MEASUREMENTS: Booster VE. RESULTS: Each group included 490 838 
      well-matched persons, who were predominantly male (88%), had a mean age of 63.0 
      years (SD, 14.0), and were followed for up to 121 days (mean, 79.8 days). Booster 
      VE more than 10 days after a booster dose was 42.3% (95% CI, 40.6% to 43.9%) 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3% (CI, 48.1% to 58.0%) against 
      SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization, and 79.1% (CI, 71.2% to 84.9%) against 
      SARS-CoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types 
      (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups, and primary vaccination regimens but was 
      significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and higher 
      comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly male population. CONCLUSION: 
      Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately 
      effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after 
      administration in the Omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which 
      is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality 
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

TI  - Emulating randomised clinical trials in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
      with non-randomised real-world evidence: an application using data from the 
      MSBase Registry.
PG  - 620-625
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2023-332603 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To mimic as closely as possible a randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
      and calibrate the real-world evidence (RWE) studies against a known treatment 
      effect would be helpful to understand if RWE can support causal conclusions in 
      selected circumstances. The aim was to emulate the TRANSFORMS trial comparing 
      Fingolimod (FTY) versus intramuscular interferon β-1a (IFN) using observational 
      data. METHODS: We extracted from the MSBase registry all the patients with 
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) collected in the period 2011-2021 
      who received IFN or FTY (0.5 mg) and with the same inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria of the TRANSFORMS RCT. The primary endpoint was the annualised relapse 
      rate (ARR) over 12 months. Patients were 1:1 propensity-score (PS) matched. 
      Relapse-rate ratio (RR) was calculated by mean of a negative binomial regression. 
      RESULTS: A total of 4376 patients with RRMS (1140 in IFN and 3236 in FTY) were 
      selected. After PS, 856 patients in each group were matched. The ARR was 0.45 in 
      IFN and 0.25 in FTY with a significant difference between the two groups (RR: 
      0.55, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.68; p<0.001). The result of the emulation was very 
      similar and fell within the 95% CI of that observed in the RCT (RR: 0.49, 95% CI: 
      0.37 to 0.64; p<0.001) with a standardised difference of 0.66 (p=0.51). 
      CONCLUSIONS: By applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the 
      RCT and employing appropriate methodology, we successfully replicated the RCT 
      results with only minor discrepancies. Also, even if the confounding bias cannot 
      be fully eliminated, conducting a rigorous target trial emulation could still 
      yield valuable insights for comparative effectiveness research.

TI  - The impact of early special educational needs provision on later hospital 
      admissions, school absence and education attainment: A target trial emulation 
      study of children with isolated cleft lip and/or palate.
PG  - e0327720

LID - e0327720
AB  - BACKGROUND: Special educational needs (SEN) provision is designed to help pupils 
      with additional educational, behavioural or health needs. Our aim was to assess 
      the impact of early SEN provision on health and educational outcomes for a 
      well-defined population, pupils with cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CLP) without 
      additional anomalies. METHODS: We used the ECHILD database, which links 
      educational and health records across England. Our target population consisted of 
      children with a recorded diagnosis of CLP without other major congenital 
      anomalies in hospital admission records in ECHILD. We applied a trial emulation 
      framework to define eligibility into our study and investigate the causal impact 
      of SEN provision in the first year of compulsory school (Year 1 - age five/six 
      years) on various health and educational outcomes accumulated by the end of 
      primary education (Year 6 - age ten/eleven years). SEN provision was categorised 
      as: None, SEN Support, and Education and Health Care Plan (EHCP). The outcomes 
      were: unplanned hospital utilisation, medical and unauthorised school absences, 
      persistent absences, and standardised key stage 1 (KS1) and key stage 2 (KS2) 
      mathematics attainment scores. To account for confounding factors affecting the 
      observed associations and estimate the causal effects of early SEN provision on 
      these outcomes, we used three estimating approaches: propensity score-based 
      methods (inverse probability weighting, [IPW]), g-computation, and augmented IPW 
      (AIPW). Causal effects were measured in terms of average treatment effects (ATE) 
      and average treatment effects on the treated (ATT), expressed as rate ratios 
      (RaR) for hospitalisations and absences, risk ratios (RiR) for persistent 
      absences, and mean differences (Δ) for academic scores. Missing values of the 
      confounders were handled via the missing covariate indicator method. We 
      triangulated these results with those obtained by univariable and multivariable 
      regression. RESULTS: Our study included 6,601 children with CLP and without 
      additional major congenital anomalies. Evaluations involving EHCP were limited by 
      the low numbers of comparative children. Thus, only comparisons of SEN Support 
      (N = 2,009, 31.6%) versus None (N = 4,350, 68.4%) are reported. Observed rates of 
      unplanned hospitalisation (RaRcrude = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12, 
      1.52), persistent absence (RiRcrude = 2.21 (1.87, 2.62)) and medical absence 
      (RaRcrude = 1.34 (1.28, 1.40)) were higher amongst children with recorded SEN 
      support, whilst KS1 and KS2 maths scores were lower (Δ crude = -0.85 (-0.90, 
      -0.79) and Δ crude = -0.82 (-0.89, -0.75), respectively). Contrary to the 
      observed relative rates and risks, we found small or no evidence of a causal 
      effect of SEN Support on unplanned hospitalisation (ATE: RaRIPW = 1.16 (1.00, 
      1.34), RaRg = 0.99 (0.87, 1.12); RaRIAPW = 1.02 (0.87, 1.17) or persistent 
      absences (ATE: RiRIPW = 1.13 (0.92, 1.34); RiRg = 1.08 (0.86, 1.31); 
      RiRAIPW = 1.20 (0.96, 1.45)). We found that SEN support increased rates of 
      medical absences (ATE: RaRIPW = 1.10 (1.04, 1.18); RaRg = 1.09 (1.03, 1.15); 
      RaRAIPW = 1.04 (0.95, 1.13)), decreased those of unauthorised absences 
      (RaRIPW = 0.86 (0.76, 0.97); RaRg = 0.98 (0.86, 1.09); RaRAIPW = 0.80 (0.66, 
      0.95)) and decreased - but not as extensively as the crude differences suggested- 
      KS1 (ATE: Δ IPW = -0.18 (-0.25, -0.10); Δ g = -0.21 (-0.26, -0.16); Δ 
      AIPW = -0.25 (-0.32, -0.17)) and KS2 maths scores (ATE: Δ IPW = -0.24 (-0.33, 
      -0.15); Δ g = -0.27 (-0.33, -0.21); Δ AIPW = -0.24 (-0.32, -0.17)). Results for 
      the ATT for each of these outcomes were similar to those for the ATE, indicating 
      no observable evidence of heterogeneity of effects by treatment received. 
      Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results. DISCUSSION: In 
      the population of children with CLP without further major congenital anomalies, 
      assignment to receive or not receiving early SEN Support appears to have no 
      harmful impact on the rates of unplanned hospitalisation or persistent absences, 
      but to increase rates of medical absences, whilst reducing rates of unauthorised 
      absences. For the sub-populations of children with key stage results, such 
      hypothetical intervention does not appear to completely reduce the observed 
      disadvantage in KS1 and KS2 mathematics scores. These results relate to the 
      impact of the intention to intervene not the actual delivery of actual SEN 
      Support provision as this information is not available in school administrative 
      records. Furthermore, we cannot discount the impact of unaccounted confounding 
      factors, such as parental education and early home learning environments, 
      particularly for the education attainment results.

TI  - Statin Initiation and Dementia Incidence in a Large Health Care System From 1997 
      to 2020: A Target Trial Emulation Study.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000213855 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research of associations between statins and 
      Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease-related dementias (AD/ADRDs) has been 
      limited by short follow-up, small samples, and confounding. We aimed to estimate 
      the association between the 1st statin prescription and incident AD/ADRD among 
      members of a large population-based cohort of older adults. METHODS: We used a 
      cohort study design emulating a target trial using data from Kaiser Permanente 
      Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care delivery system. 
      Participants were born before 1951 and KPNC members for 4+ years during 
      1997-2010. Embedded subsamples included sociodemographic and genetic data. Statin 
      initiators were matched at first prescription ("baseline") with up to 5 
      "noninitiators" based on age and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). 
      Participants with extreme propensity scores were excluded. The outcome was time 
      to incident AD/ADRD diagnosis, censoring, or the administrative end of study 
      (December 31, 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard 
      ratios for statin initiation on AD/ADRD incidence. Follow-up time was divided at 
      the first year of follow-up to account for increased AD/ADRD detection in the 
      first year due to increased interaction with the health care system after a 
      statin prescription. RESULTS: Among eligible participants (n = 705,061), 264,294 
      individuals (37.5% of eligible participants) initiated any statin during 
      2001-2010 ("initiators"), of whom 249,613 (94.4%) were matched with 255,937 
      unique noninitiators to create the analytic sample (322,358 unique participants; 
      mean age at baseline = 67.4 years; 55.1% female). The average follow-up was 11.8 
      years. In the first year after initiating statins, AD/ADRD diagnoses were 
      elevated by 46% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.46, 95% CI 1.42-1.53) compared with 
      noninitiators. After 1 year, statin initiators experienced no difference in 
      AD/ADRD incidence (full sample: HR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.01; subsample with 
      survey covariates: HR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.06; subsample with survey and genetic 
      covariates: HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.91-1.07). Adjustment for sociodemographic 
      covariates and apolipoprotein E e4 allele count did not materially change the 
      findings. DISCUSSION: In this large emulated target trial, statin initiation was 
      inconsistent with more than a 3% increase or decrease in the hazard of AD/ADRD 
      after the first year of follow-up. This intent-to-treat analysis does not 
      directly quantify effects of long-term exposure to statins. Associations in the 
      first year likely reflect increased medical observation immediately after statin 
      initiation. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This emulated trial provides Class II 
      evidence that statin initiation is not associated with AD/ADRD or AD incidence 
      after the first year of follow-up.

TI  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular events among 
      patients with type 2 diabetes and low-to-normal body mass index: a nationwide 
      cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with low-to-normal body mass index (BMI; < 25.0 kg/m(2)) 
      were underrepresented in major randomized controlled trials on sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes. The present study aims to 
      investigate the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular outcomes 
      among patients with type 2 diabetes and low-to-normal BMI, using finer 
      stratification than previous trials. METHODS: This cohort study with a target 
      trial emulation framework was conducted using insurance claims and health 
      screening records of more than 30 million working-age citizens in Japan acquired 
      from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2022. 139,783 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors 
      matched to 139,783 users of dipeptidyl protease (DPP) 4 inhibitors with 
      stratification by BMI category (< 20.0, 20.0-22.4, 22.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, 
      30.0-34.9, and 35.0 ≤ kg/m(2)). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause 
      death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure. Secondary outcomes were 
      the components of the primary outcome. Cox proportional hazard models were used 
      to compare SGLT2 inhibitors with DPP4 inhibitors in the whole population and 
      subgroups defined by the BMI category. RESULTS: Among participants, 17.3% 
      (n = 48,377) were female and 31.0% (n = 86,536) had low-to-normal BMI 
      (< 20.0 kg/m(2), 1.9% [n = 5,350]; 20.0-22.4 kg/m(2), 8.5% [n = 23,818]; and 
      22.5-24.9 kg/m(2), 20.5% [n = 57,368]). Over a median follow-up of 24 months, the 
      primary outcome occurred in 2.9% (n = 8,165) of participants. SGLT2 inhibitors 
      were associated with a decreased incidence of the primary outcome in the whole 
      population (HR [95%CI] = 0.92 [0.89 to 0.96]), but not in patients with 
      low-to-normal BMI (< 20.0 kg/m(2), HR [95%CI] = 1.08 [0.80 to 1.46]; 
      20.0-22.4 kg/m(2), HR [95%CI] = 1.04 [0.90 to 1.20]; and 22.5-24.9 kg/m(2), HR 
      [95%CI] = 0.92 [0.84 to 1.01]). CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of SGLT2 
      inhibitors on cardiovascular events among patients with type 2 diabetes appeared 
      to decrease with lower BMI and was not significant among patients with 
      low-to-normal BMI (< 25.0 kg/m2). These findings suggest the importance of 
      considering BMI when initiating SGLT2 inhibitors.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors for the Primary 
      Prevention of Cardiovascular, Renal Events, and Safety Outcomes in Patients With 
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Comorbid Type 2 Diabetes: A Population-Based 
      Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 414-422
LID - 10.1002/art.43037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were excluded from 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) clinical trials. It is unknown 
      whether the cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2i extend to patients with SLE and 
      comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: We performed an emulated clinical trial 
      in an insurance-based cohort in the United States, evaluating SGLT2i versus 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) for primary prevention of 
      cardiovascular, renal, and other clinical outcomes among patients with both SLE 
      and comorbid T2D. SGLT2i initiators were matched to DPP4i initiators using 
      propensity scores (PSs) based on clinical and demographic factors. Hazard ratios 
      (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox models. 
      RESULTS: Outcomes among 2,165 patients starting SGLT2i and 2,165 PS-matched 
      patients starting DPP4i were compared. Over 753.1 (±479.2) mean days, SGLT2i 
      recipients had significantly lower risks of incident acute kidney injury (HR 
      0.49, 95% CI 0.39-0.63), chronic kidney disease (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50-0.76), 
      end-stage renal disease (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.80), heart failure (HR 0.72, 95% 
      CI 0.56-0.92), emergency department visits (HR 0.90, 0.82-0.99), and severe 
      sepsis (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.94). Risks of all-cause mortality (HR 0.89, 95% CI 
      0.65-1.21), lupus nephritis (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.38-1.15), myocardial infarction 
      (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54-1.23), stroke (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.74-1.44), and 
      hospitalizations (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.12) did not differ. Genital infection 
      risk (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.61) was increased, but urinary tract infection risk 
      (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.03) did not differ. No significant difference was 
      observed for diabetic ketoacidosis risk (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.53-2.14) and fractures 
      (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66-1.36). CONCLUSION: In this emulated clinical trial, 
      treatment with SGLT2i, compared to DPP4i therapy, was associated with 
      significantly reduced risks of several cardiorenal complications among patients 
      with both SLE and T2D.

TI  - Oral Glucocorticoids for Skin Fibrosis in Early Diffuse Systemic Sclerosis: A 
      Target Trial Emulation Study From the European Scleroderma Trials and Research 
      Group Database.
PG  - 649-657
LID - 10.1002/acr.25469 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate whether adding oral 
      glucocorticoids to immunosuppressive therapy improves skin scores and ensures 
      safety in patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc). 
      METHODS: We performed an emulated randomized trial comparing the changes from 
      baseline to 12 ± 3 months of the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS: primary 
      outcome) in patients with early dcSSc receiving either oral glucocorticoids (≤20 
      mg/day prednisone equivalent) combined with immunosuppression (treated) or 
      immunosuppression alone (controls), using data from the European Scleroderma 
      Trials and Research Group. Secondary end points were the difference occurrence of 
      progressive skin or lung fibrosis and scleroderma renal crisis. Matching 
      propensity score was used to adjust for baseline imbalance between groups. 
      RESULTS: We matched 208 patients (mean age 49 years; 33% male; 59% anti-Scl70), 
      104 in each treatment group, obtaining comparable characteristics at baseline. In 
      the treated group, patients received a median prednisone dose of 5 mg/day. Mean 
      mRSS change at 12 ± 3 months was similar in the two groups (decrease of 2.7 [95% 
      confidence interval {95% CI} 1.4-4.0] in treated vs 3.1 [95% CI 1.9-4.4] in 
      control, P = 0.64). Similar results were observed in patients with shorter 
      disease duration (≤ 24 months) or with mRSS ≤22. There was no between-group 
      difference for all prespecified secondary outcomes. A case of scleroderma renal 
      crisis occurred in both groups. CONCLUSION: We did not find any significant 
      benefit of adding low-dose oral glucocorticoids to immunosuppression for skin 
      fibrosis, and at this dosage, glucocorticoid did not increase the risk of 
      scleroderma renal crisis.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Adalimumab vs Tofacitinib in Patients With 
      Rheumatoid Arthritis in Australia.
PG  - e2320851
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.20851 [doi]
LID - e2320851
AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is a need for observational studies to supplement evidence from 
      clinical trials, and the target trial emulation (TTE) framework can help avoid 
      biases that can be introduced when treatments are compared crudely using 
      observational data by applying design principles for randomized clinical trials. 
      Adalimumab (ADA) and tofacitinib (TOF) were shown to be equivalent in patients 
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a randomized clinical trial, but to our 
      knowledge, these drugs have not been compared head-to-head using routinely 
      collected clinical data and the TTE framework. OBJECTIVE: To emulate a randomized 
      clinical trial comparing ADA vs TOF in patients with RA who were new users of a 
      biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD). 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study emulating 
      a randomized clinical trial of ADA vs TOF included Australian adults aged 18 
      years or older with RA in the Optimising Patient Outcomes in Australian 
      Rheumatology (OPAL) data set. Patients were included if they initiated ADA or TOF 
      between October 1, 2015, and April 1, 2021; were new b/tsDMARD users; and had at 
      least 1 component of the disease activity score in 28 joints using C-reactive 
      protein (DAS28-CRP) recorded at baseline or during follow-up. INTERVENTION: 
      Treatment with either ADA (40 mg every 14 days) or TOF (10 mg daily). MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the estimated average treatment 
      effect, defined as the difference in mean DAS28-CRP among patients receiving TOF 
      compared with those receiving ADA at 3 and 9 months after initiating treatment. 
      Missing DAS28-CRP data were multiply imputed. Stable balancing weights were used 
      to account for nonrandomized treatment assignment. RESULTS: A total of 842 
      patients were identified, including 569 treated with ADA (387 [68.0%] female; 
      median age, 56 years [IQR, 47-66 years]) and 273 treated with TOF (201 [73.6%] 
      female; median age, 59 years [IQR, 51-68 years]). After applying stable balancing 
      weights, mean DAS28-CRP in the ADA group was 5.3 (95% CI, 5.2-5.4) at baseline, 
      2.6 (95% CI, 2.5-2.7) at 3 months, and 2.3 (95% CI, 2.2-2.4) at 9 months; in the 
      TOF group, it was 5.3 (95% CI, 5.2-5.4) at baseline, 2.4 (95% CI, 2.2-2.5) at 3 
      months, and 2.3 (95% CI, 2.1-2.4) at 9 months. The estimated average treatment 
      effect was -0.2 (95% CI, -0.4 to -0.03; P = .02) at 3 months and -0.03 (95% CI, 
      -0.2 to 0.1; P = .60) at 9 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, 
      there was a modest but statistically significant reduction in DAS28-CRP at 3 
      months for patients receiving TOF compared with those receiving ADA and no 
      difference between treatment groups at 9 months. Three months of treatment with 
      either drug led to clinically relevant average reductions in mean DAS28-CRP, 
      consistent with remission.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Changes in everyday functioning are crucial to assessing the 
      long-term impact of COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of 
      COVID-19 infection on everyday functioning 18 months after infection among 
      veterans with and without histories of COVID-19 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the US Veterans Affairs (VA) and 
      included 186 veterans who had COVID-19 between October 2020 and April 2021 (ie, 
      COVID-19 cohort) and 186 matched comparators who did not have documented COVID-19 
      infections (ie, control cohort). This match balanced the risk of COVID-19 based 
      on 39 variables measured in the 24 months before infection or match, using 
      principles of target trial emulation. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to 
      December 2023. EXPOSURE: First documented COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: 
      The differences in self-reported everyday functioning 18 months after COVID-19 
      infection were estimated and compared with their matched comparators. 
      Within-matched pair logistic and linear regressions assessed differences in 
      outcomes and were weighted to account for sampling and nonresponse. RESULTS: 
      Among the 186 matched pairs of participants, their weighted mean age was 60.4 
      (95% CI, 57.5 to 63.2) years among veterans in the COVID-19 cohort (weighted 
      sample, 91 459 of 101 133 [90.4%] male; 30 611 [30.3%] Black or African American 
      veterans; 65 196 [64.4%] White veterans) and 61.1 (95% CI, 57.8 to 64.4) years 
      among their comparators in the control cohort (91 459 [90.4%] male; 24 576 
      [24.3%] Black or African American veterans; 70 157 [69.4%] White veterans). A 
      high proportion of veterans in the COVID-19 cohort (weighted percentage, 44.9% 
      [95% CI, 34.2% to 56.2%]) reported that they could do less than what they felt 
      they could do at the beginning of 2020 compared with the control cohort (weighted 
      percentage, 35.3%; [95% CI, 25.6% to 46.4%]; within-matched pair adjusted odds 
      ratio [OR], 1.52 [95% CI, 0.79 to 2.91]). There was no association of documented 
      COVID-19 infection with fatigue, substantial pain, limitations in either 
      activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, severely 
      curtailed life-space mobility, employment, or mean health-related quality of life 
      on a utility scale. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of veterans 
      with and without documented COVID-19, many reported a substantial loss of 
      everyday functioning during the pandemic regardless of whether or not they had a 
      documented infection with COVID-19. Future work with larger samples is needed to 
      validate the estimated associations.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of subcutaneous sarilumab 200 mg biweekly, subcutaneous 
      Tocilizumab 162 mg biweekly, and intravenous Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks in 
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While targeting the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) through the use of 
      sarilumab (SAR) or tocilizumab (TCZ) has become a major therapeutic approach for 
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), direct comparisons between IL-6R inhibitors (IL-6Ris) 
      for treating RA have not been conducted. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of 
      subcutaneous sarilumab (SAR-SC), subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ-SC), and 
      intravenous TCZ (TCZ-IV) against RA in a multicenter cohort study. METHODS: 
      Within the target trial emulation framework, an incident new-user and 
      active-comparator cohort design was used. The source population was the entire 
      cohort of a multicenter prospective study (the ANSWER cohort study) in Japan from 
      2009 to 2023. We consecutively included patients with IL-6Ri-naïve RA who 
      initiated treatment with SAR-SC 200 mg biweekly, TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly, or 
      TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks as the approved starting dose and dosing interval at 
      baseline. The primary outcome of interest was the change in the clinical disease 
      activity index (CDAI) at 24 weeks. RESULTS: In total, 1001 IL-6Ri-naïve patients 
      were included (SAR-SC 200 mg biweekly, 201 patients; TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly, 546; 
      TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 week, 254). The improvement in CDAI at 24 weeks (primary 
      outcome) was statistically significantly greater in the SAR-SC group than in the 
      TCZ-SC group (-2.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.38 to -0.69, p = 0.007), 
      but that in TCZ-IV was not significantly different from that in TCZ-SC (1.00, 95% 
      CI: -0.68 to 2.69, p = 0.243). Similar results were noted regarding the changes 
      in CDAI at weeks 4, 12, and 48. The retention rates at 48 weeks in SAR-SC and 
      TCZ-IV did not significantly differ from that in TCZ-SC. CONCLUSIONS: SAR-SC 
      200 mg biweekly initiation was associated with a statistically significantly 
      greater decrease in disease activity than TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly in IL-6Ri-naïve 
      patients with RA. In contrast, no statistically significant differences were 
      identified between TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 week and TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly. 
      However, the effect size of our findings should necessitate careful consideration 
      of the cost difference between TCZ-SC 162 mg biweekly including its biosimilars 
      and SAR-SC 200 mg biweekly.

TI  - Effect of Four Hemoglobin Transfusion Threshold Strategies in Patients With Acute 
      Myocardial Infarction and Anemia : A Target Trial Emulation Using MINT Trial 
      Data.
PG  - 1489-1498
LID - 10.7326/M24-0571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal hemoglobin threshold to guide red blood cell (RBC) 
      transfusion for patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and anemia is 
      uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy of 4 individual hemoglobin 
      thresholds (<10 g/dL [<100 g/L], <9 g/dL [<90 g/L], <8 g/dL [<80 g/L], and <7 
      g/dL [<70 g/L]) to guide transfusion in patients with acute MI and anemia. 
      DESIGN: Prespecified secondary analysis of the MINT (Myocardial Ischemia and 
      Transfusion) trial using target trial emulation methods. (ClinicalTrials.gov: 
      NCT02981407). SETTING: 144 clinical sites in 6 countries. PARTICIPANTS: 3492 MINT 
      trial participants with acute MI and a hemoglobin level below 10 g/dL. 
      INTERVENTION: Four transfusion strategies to maintain patients' hemoglobin 
      concentrations at or above thresholds of 10, 9, 8, or 7 g/dL. Protocol exceptions 
      were permitted for specified adverse clinical events. MEASUREMENTS: Data from the 
      MINT trial were leveraged to emulate 4 transfusion strategies and estimate per 
      protocol effects on the composite outcome of 30-day death or recurrent MI 
      (death/MI) and 30-day death using inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: The 
      30-day risk for death/MI was 14.8% (95% CI, 11.8% to 18.4%) for a <10-g/dL 
      strategy, 15.1% (CI, 11.7% to 18.2%) for a <9-g/dL strategy, 15.9% (CI, 12.4% to 
      19.0%) for a <8-g/dL strategy, and 18.3% (CI, 14.6% to 22.0%) for a <7-g/dL 
      strategy. Absolute risk differences and risk ratios relative to the <10-g/dL 
      strategy for 30-day death/MI increased as thresholds decreased, although 95% CIs 
      were wide. Findings were similar and imprecise for 30-day death. LIMITATION: 
      Unmeasured confounding may have persisted despite adjustment. CONCLUSION: The 
      30-day risks for death/MI and death among patients with acute MI and anemia seem 
      to increase progressively with lower hemoglobin concentration thresholds for 
      transfusion. However, the imprecision around estimates from this target trial 
      analysis precludes definitive conclusions about individual hemoglobin thresholds.

TI  - Effect of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) on Hospitalization among Adults with 
      COVID-19: an EHR-based Target Trial Emulation from N3C.

AB  - This study leverages electronic health record data in the National COVID Cohort 
      Collaborative's (N3C) repository to investigate disparities in Paxlovid treatment 
      and to emulate a target trial assessing its effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 
      hospitalization rates. From an eligible population of 632,822 COVID-19 patients 
      seen at 33 clinical sites across the United States between December 23, 2021 and 
      December 31, 2022, patients were matched across observed treatment groups, 
      yielding an analytical sample of 410,642 patients. We estimate a 65% reduced odds 
      of hospitalization among Paxlovid-treated patients within a 28-day follow-up 
      period, and this effect did not vary by patient vaccination status. Notably, we 
      observe disparities in Paxlovid treatment, with lower rates among Black and 
      Hispanic or Latino patients, and within socially vulnerable communities. Ours is 
      the largest study of Paxlovid's real-world effectiveness to date, and our primary 
      findings are consistent with previous randomized control trials and real-world 
      studies.

TI  - Comparison of safety and efficacy between Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir 
      in the treatment of COVID-19 infection in patients with advanced kidney disease: 
      a retrospective observational study.
PG  - 102620
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102620 [doi]
LID - 102620
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is used in patients with coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) with normal or mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 ml/min per 
      1.73 m(2)). There is limited data regarding its use in advanced kidney disease 
      (eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). We performed a retrospective territory-wide 
      observational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 
      when compared with molnupiravir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 with 
      advanced kidney disease. METHODS: We adopted target trial emulation using data 
      from a territory-wide electronic health record database on eligible patients aged 
      ≥18 years with advanced kidney disease (history of eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) 
      who were infected with COVID-19 and were prescribed with either molnupiravir or 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within five days of infection during the period from 16 
      March 2022 to 31 December 2022. A sequence trial approach and 1:4 propensity 
      score matching was applied based on the baseline covariates including age, sex, 
      number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), 
      hospitalisation, eGFR, renal replacement therapy, comorbidities (cancer, 
      respiratory disease, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, diabetes, 
      hypertension), and drug use (renin-angiotensin-system agents, beta blockers, 
      calcium channel blockers, diuretics, nitrates, lipid lowering agents, insulins, 
      oral antidiabetic drugs, antiplatelets, immuno-suppressants, corticosteroids, 
      proton pump inhibitors, histamine H(2) receptor antagonists, monoclonal antibody 
      infusion) within past 90 days. Individuals were followed up from the index date 
      until the earliest outcome occurrence, death, 90 days from index date or the end 
      of data availability. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted 
      with baseline covariates was used to compare the risk of outcomes between 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir recipients and molnupiravir recipients which include (i) 
      all-cause mortality, (ii) intensive care unit (ICU) admission, (iii) ventilatory 
      support, (iv) hospitalisation, (v) hepatic impairment, (vi) ischaemic stroke, and 
      (vii) myocardial infarction. Subgroup analyses included age (<70; ≥70 years); 
      sex, Charlson comorbidity index (≤5; >5), and number of COVID-19 vaccine doses 
      received (0-1; ≥2 doses). FINDINGS: A total of 4886 patients were included 
      (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 1462; molnupiravir: 3424). There were 347 events of 
      all-cause mortality (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 74, 5.06%; molnupiravir: 273, 
      7.97%), 10 events of ICU admission (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 4, 0.27%; 
      molnupiravir: 6, 0.18%), 48 events of ventilatory support 
      (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 13, 0.89%; molnupiravir: 35, 1.02%), 836 events of 
      hospitalisation (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 218, 23.98%; molnupiravir: 618, 28.14%), 
      1 event of hepatic impairment (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 0, 0%; molnupiravir: 1, 
      0.03%), 8 events of ischaemic stroke (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 3, 0.22%; 
      molnupiravir: 5, 0.16%) and 9 events of myocardial infarction 
      (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 2, 0.15%; molnupiravir: 7, 0.22%). 
      Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users had lower rates of all-cause mortality (absolute 
      risk reduction (ARR) at 90 days 2.91%, 95% CI: 1.47-4.36%) and hospitalisation 
      (ARR at 90 days 4.16%, 95% CI: 0.81-7.51%) as compared with molnupiravir users. 
      Similar rates of ICU admission (ARR at 90 days -0.09%, 95% CI: -0.4 to 0.2%), 
      ventilatory support (ARR at 90 days 0.13%, 95% CI: -0.45 to 0.72%), hepatic 
      impairment (ARR at 90 days 0.03%, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.09%), ischaemic stroke (ARR 
      at 90 days -0.06%, 95% CI: -0.35 to 0.22%), and myocardial infarction (ARR at 90 
      days 0.07%, 95% CI: -0.19 to 0.33%) were found between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 
      molnupiravir users. Consistent results were observed in relative risk adjusted 
      with baseline characteristics. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with 
      significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.624, 95% CI: 
      0.455-0.857) and hospitalisation (HR: 0.782, 95% CI: 0.64-0.954). INTERPRETATION: 
      Patients with COVID-19 with advanced kidney disease receiving 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir had a lower rate of all-cause mortality and hospital 
      admission when compared with molnupiravir. Other adverse clinical outcomes were 
      similar in both treatment groups. FUNDING: Health and Medical Research Fund

TI  - Effect of Early and Delayed Treatment With Remdesivir on Mortality in Patients 
      Hospitalized With COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We applied a target trial emulation framework to estimate the 
      association between early and delayed initiation of remdesivir (RDV) with 
      mortality in hospitalized adults between May 1, 2020, and July 31, 2024, with 
      varying coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical severity. METHODS: Using 
      electronic health records in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) 
      database, we emulated a sequence of randomized target trials initiated on each of 
      the first 7 days of hospitalization. We identified 373 226 eligible person-trial 
      hospitalizations, of which 53 959 were initiators and 319 267 were noninitiators 
      of RDV treatment. Patients were divided into clinical severity subgroups based on 
      baseline oxygenation, which included no supplemental oxygen (NSO), noninvasive 
      supplemental oxygen (NISO), or invasive ventilation (IV). In each trial, 
      initiators were matched with replacement to noninitiators receiving the same 
      oxygenation type. Trials beginning on days 1-3 and days 4-7 of hospitalization 
      were pooled separately to evaluate the effects of early and delayed initiation of 
      RDV, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the 
      marginal hazard ratio for mortality between initiators and noninitiators within 
      each treatment delay. RESULTS: Across trials, 53 449 initiators were matched to 
      26 600 unique noninitiators. Early, but not delayed, RDV treatment was associated 
      with a reduction in 60-day mortality in the NSO (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 
      0.84-0.95) and NISO subgroups (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99), but not in those 
      receiving IV. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Early treatment with RDV is associated with reduced mortality risk in 
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients either not on supplemental oxygen or receiving 
      noninvasive supplemental oxygen.

TI  - Outcomes of Mechanical Thrombectomy in Patients With Acute Basilar Artery 
      Occlusion With Mild to Moderate Symptoms.
PG  - e210086
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000210086 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The benefit of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in 
      patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) and 
      a baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score <10 is unclear 
      because this subpopulation has been substantially excluded from large clinical 
      trials. The aim of our study was to determine whether MT ± IV thrombolysis (IVT) 
      improves functional outcomes compared with IVT alone in patients with BAO and a 
      NIHSS score <10. METHODS: We emulated a hypothetical trial including adult 
      patients with BAO, a baseline NIHSS score <10, and prestroke modified Rankin 
      scale (mRS) scores 0-2, comparing MT (±IVT) with IVT alone. We acquired data from 
      patients receiving MT (±IVT) within 24 hours of onset from the Italian Registry 
      of Endovascular Treatment in Acute Stroke and data from patients treated only 
      with IVT within 9 hours of symptom onset from the SITS International Stroke 
      Thrombolysis Register, from 2011 until 2021. We used inverse probability 
      weighting (IPW) adjusted for prespecified covariates to weight each individual's 
      contribution to the outcome. The primary outcome was 90-day mRS scores 0-2. 
      Secondary outcomes included 90-day mRS scores 0-1, 90-day mRS scores 4-5, 
      mortality at 90 days, in-hospital death, and symptomatic intracerebral 
      hemorrhage. RESULTS: Among the 764 patients recruited from the 2 databases (477 
      men [62.4%]; mean age [±SD] 67.88 [±13.9] years), 410 (53.7%) received MT±IVT and 
      354 (46.3%) only IVT. After applying IPW, our population was composed of 710 MT 
      and 707 IVT patients. Of these, 454 MT-treated (63.9%) and 383 IVT-treated 
      (54.2%) patients had a 90-day mRS score of 0-2 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.56 
      [95% CI 1.04-2.03]). MT was also associated with a higher rate of mRS scores 0-1 
      (aOR 2.01 [95% CI 1.37-2.95]) and a lower rate of in-hospital death (aOR 0.45 
      [95% CI 0.25-0.78]). Among the subgroups tested, MT had a larger effect on 90-day 
      mRS scores 0-2 for patients with NIHSS scores 6-9 than for patients with a NIHSS 
      score <6 (p for interaction 0.02). DISCUSSION: In a large-scale target trial 
      emulation on patients with stroke from BAO and a NIHSS score <10, MT was 
      associated with better functional outcomes compared with IVT alone. Further 
      research is needed to confirm the benefit of MT in patients with a NIHSS score 
      <6. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that MT ± 
      intravenous thrombolysis is associated with better 90-day functional outcomes in 
      patients with BAO and a NIHSS score < 10 compared with intravenous thrombolysis 
      alone.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Second-line Antihyperglycemic Agents for 
      Cardiovascular Outcomes: A Large-scale, Multinational, Federated Analysis of the 
      LEGEND-T2DM Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) 
      reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, their effectiveness relative to each other and 
      other second-line antihyperglycemic agents is unknown, without any major ongoing 
      head-to-head trials. METHODS: Across the LEGEND-T2DM network, we included ten 
      federated international data sources, spanning 1992-2021. We identified 1,492,855 
      patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) on metformin 
      monotherapy who initiated one of four second-line agents (SGLT2is, GLP1-RAs, 
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor [DPP4is], sulfonylureas [SUs]). We used 
      large-scale propensity score models to conduct an active comparator, target trial 
      emulation for pairwise comparisons. After evaluating empirical equipoise and 
      population generalizability, we fit on-treatment Cox proportional hazard models 
      for 3-point MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, death) and 4-point MACE (3-point 
      MACE + heart failure hospitalization) risk, and combined hazard ratio (HR) 
      estimates in a random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: Across cohorts, 16·4%, 
      8·3%, 27·7%, and 47·6% of individuals with T2DM initiated SGLT2is, GLP1-RAs, 
      DPP4is, and SUs, respectively. Over 5·2 million patient-years of follow-up and 
      489 million patient-days of time at-risk, there were 25,982 3-point MACE and 
      41,447 4-point MACE events. SGLT2is and GLP1-RAs were associated with a lower 
      risk for 3-point MACE compared with DPP4is (HR 0·89 [95% CI, 0·79-1·00] and 0·83 
      [0·70-0·98]), and SUs (HR 0·76 [0·65-0·89] and 0·71 [0·59-0·86]). DPP4is were 
      associated with a lower 3-point MACE risk versus SUs (HR 0·87 [0·79-0·95]). The 
      pattern was consistent for 4-point MACE for the comparisons above. There were no 
      significant differences between SGLT2is and GLP1-RAs for 3-point or 4-point MACE 
      (HR 1·06 [0·96-1·17] and 1·05 [0·97-1·13]). INTERPRETATION: In patients with T2DM 
      and established CVD, we found comparable cardiovascular risk reduction with 
      SGLT2is and GLP1-RAs, with both agents more effective than DPP4is, which in turn 
      were more effective than SUs. These findings suggest that the use of GLP1-RAs and 
      SGLT2is should be prioritized as second-line agents in those with established 
      CVD. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health, United States Department of Veterans

TI  - Glucarpidase for treatment of high-dose methotrexate toxicity.
PG  - 1858-1869
LID - 10.1182/blood.2024026211 [doi]
AB  - High-dose methotrexate (MTX) results in high rates of acute kidney injury (AKI), 
      neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity. Glucarpidase is a recombinant enzyme that 
      cleaves MTX, but clinical data supporting its use are scarce. We examined the 
      association between glucarpidase administration and outcomes in adults with 
      MTX-AKI from 28 cancer centers across the United States using a sequential target 
      trial emulation framework. The primary end point was kidney recovery at hospital 
      discharge, defined as survival to discharge with serum creatinine <1.5-fold 
      baseline and without dialysis dependence. Key secondary end points were time to 
      kidney recovery, neutropenia, and transaminitis on day 7, and time to death. 
      Using multivariable logistic and Cox regression models, we compared outcomes in 
      patients who received glucarpidase within 4 days following MTX initiation with 
      those in patients who did not. Among 708 patients with MTX-AKI, 209 (29.5%) 
      received glucarpidase. Overall, 183 (25.8%) had a primary end point event. 
      Glucarpidase receipt was associated with a 2.70-fold higher adjusted odds of 
      kidney recovery (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-4.31) compared with no 
      glucarpidase receipt. Patients treated with glucarpidase also had faster time to 
      kidney recovery (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.33) and lower 
      risks of grade ≥2 neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.50; 95% CI, 
      0.28-0.91) and grade ≥2 transaminitis (aOR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91) on day 7. 
      There was no difference in time to death (aHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.49-1.18). These 
      data suggest glucarpidase may improve both renal and extrarenal outcomes in 
      patients with MTX-AKI.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of alternative second-line oral glucose-lowering 
      therapies for type 2 diabetes: a precision medicine approach applied to routine 
      data.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-025-06447-x [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: National clinical guidelines recommend that second-line 
      treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus is chosen according to individuals' 
      characteristics but there is limited evidence available to inform this choice. 
      This paper's aim is to compare the effects on HbA(1c) of sulfonylureas (SU), 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
      inhibitors (SGLT2i) added to metformin as second-line oral glucose-lowering 
      treatments according to an individual's age, baseline HbA(1c) and presence of 
      multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs). METHODS: We accessed primary care-hospital 
      linked data for 41,790 individuals from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
      (CPRD) in England who initiated second-line treatment after metformin between 
      2015 and 2021. We combined target trial emulation with instrumental variable 
      analysis to reduce the risk of confounding. The outcome was change in HbA(1c) 
      between baseline and 1 year follow-up. We reported results stratified by age 
      (18-49 years, 50-69 years and ≥70 years), baseline HbA(1c) (<67 mmol/mol [<8.3%], 
      67-77 mmol/mol [8.3-9.2%] and >77 mmol/mol [>9.2%]) and presence of MLTCs. 
      RESULTS: The mean (95% CI) difference in HbA(1c) change for SGLT2i vs SU was 
      larger for people aged 18-49 years (-5.74 mmol/mol [-7.47, -4.01]) (-0.5% [-0.7, 
      -0.4]) than for those aged 50-69 years (-4.03 mmol/mol [-5.61, -2.44]) (-0.4% 
      [-0.5, -0.2]) and for those aged 70 years or over (-2.68 mmol/mol [-4.50, -0.86]) 
      (-0.3% [-0.4, -0.07]). The mean (95% CI) difference in HbA(1c) change for SGLT2i 
      vs DPP4i was -5.80 mmol/mol (-7.60, -4.00) (-0.5% [-0.7, -0.4]) for those aged 
      18-49 years, -4.13 mmol/mol (-5.82, -2.45) (-0.4% [-0.5, -0.2]) for those aged 
      50-69 years and -3.13 mmol/mol (-5.01, -1.24) (-0.3% [-0.4, -0.1]) for those aged 
      ≥70 years. The mean difference (improvement) in HbA(1c) was similar across 
      subgroups defined by baseline HbA(1c) or presence of MLTCs. For SGLT2i vs SU, the 
      mean (95% CI) difference was -5.37 mmol/mol (-7.13, -3.62) (-0.5% [-0.6, -0.3]) 
      for people without MLTC and -3.72 mmol/mol (-5.34, -2.10]) (-0.3% [-0.5, -0.2]) 
      for people with MLTC. For SGLT2i vs DPP4i the corresponding estimated differences 
      (95% CI) were -5.44 mmol/mol (-7.27, -3.61) (-0.5% [-0.7, -0.3]) for those 
      without MLTC and -3.93 mmol/mol (-5.64, -2.21) (-0.3% [-0.5, -0.2]) for those 
      with MLTC. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Second-line treatment with SGLT2i is more 
      effective than SU or DPP4i in reducing HbA(1c) across subgroups of people defined 
      by age, baseline HbA(1c) and presence of MLTCs. Our evidence complements RCTs in 
      using routinely available information on demographic characteristics, biomarkers 
      and comorbidities to inform an individualised approach.

TI  - Effect of Initiation and Continuous Adherence to ARBs Versus ACEIs on Risk of 
      Adjudicated Mild Cognitive Impairment or Dementia.
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glaf028 [doi]
LID - glaf028
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether the differing mechanistic effects between angiotensin-2 
      receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on 
      the renin-angiotensin system translate to differential effects on clinical 
      cognitive outcomes is unclear. METHODS: We employed an active comparator, 
      new-user cohort study to emulate a target trial evaluating the per-protocol 
      effect of initiating and continuously adhering to an ARB versus ACEI on 
      adjudicated amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia (PD) 
      in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Inverse probability 
      of treatment and censoring weighted cumulative incidence functions accounted for 
      confounding, the competing risk of death, adherence, and loss to follow-up. 
      RESULTS: Of 9,361 SPRINT participants (mean age 67.1 ± 9.5 years, 36.7% female, 
      58.7% non-Hispanic White), 710 and 1,289 were new users of an ARB or ACEI. 
      Overall, 291 (41.0%) ARB initiators and 854 (66.3%) ACEI initiators were 
      nonadherent during follow-up. The IP-weighted 4-year probabilities of full 
      adherence and being alive among ARB was 56.0% (95% CI: 52.2%-59.9%) and 30.5% 
      (95% CI: 28.0%-33.1%) for ACEI. The 4-year weighted risk ratios (RR) for amnestic 
      MCI/PD and for amnestic MCI/PD/death with initiation and full adherence to ARB 
      versus ACEI were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.66-1.29) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.58-1.06). The 
      weighted 4-year weighted RR for all-cause death with ARB versus ACEI initiation 
      and adherence was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: In this target trial 
      emulation of older adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease, there was 
      insufficient evidence to conclude a beneficial effect of initiating and 
      continuously adhering to an ARB versus ACEI on adjudicated clinical cognitive 
      outcomes.

      Cardiovascular Outcomes: A Multinational, Federated Analysis of LEGEND-T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) reduce the risk of major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      However, their effectiveness relative to each other and other second-line 
      antihyperglycemic agents is unknown, without any major ongoing head-to-head 
      clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the 
      cardiovascular effectiveness of SGLT2is, GLP-1 RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
      inhibitors (DPP4is), and clinical sulfonylureas (SUs) as second-line 
      antihyperglycemic agents in T2DM. METHODS: Across the LEGEND-T2DM (Large-Scale 
      Evidence Generation and Evaluation Across a Network of Databases for Type 2 
      Diabetes Mellitus) network, 10 federated international data sources were 
      included, spanning 1992 to 2021. In total, 1,492,855 patients with T2DM and 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) on metformin monotherapy were identified who 
      initiated 1 of 4 second-line agents (SGLT2is, GLP-1 RAs, DPP4is, or SUs). 
      Large-scale propensity score models were used to conduct an active-comparator 
      target trial emulation for pairwise comparisons. After evaluating empirical 
      equipoise and population generalizability, on-treatment Cox proportional hazards 
      models were fit for 3-point MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) and 
      4-point MACE (3-point MACE plus heart failure hospitalization) risk and HR 
      estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Over 5.2 
      million patient-years of follow-up and 489 million patient-days of time at risk, 
      patients experienced 25,982 3-point MACE and 41,447 4-point MACE. SGLT2is and 
      GLP-1 RAs were associated with lower 3-point MACE risk than DPP4is (HR: 0.89 
      [95% CI: 0.79-1.00] and 0.83 [95% CI: 0.70-0.98]) and SUs (HR: 0.76 [95% CI: 
      0.65-0.89] and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.58-0.88]). DPP4is were associated with lower 
      3-point MACE risk than SUs (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79-0.95). The pattern for 3-point 
      MACE was also observed for the 4-point MACE outcome. There were no significant 
      differences between SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs for 3-point or 4-point MACE (HR: 1.06 
      [95% CI: 0.96-1.17] and 1.05 [95% CI: 0.97-1.13]). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      T2DM and CVD, comparable cardiovascular risk reduction was found with SGLT2is and 
      GLP-1 RAs, with both agents more effective than DPP4is, which in turn were more 
      effective than SUs. These findings suggest that the use of SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs 
      should be prioritized as second-line agents in those with established CVD.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe respiratory failure 
      from COVID-19.
PG  - 208-221
LID - 10.1007/s00134-020-06331-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Limited data are available on venovenous extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We examined the clinical features 
      and outcomes of 190 patients treated with ECMO within 14 days of ICU admission, 
      using data from a multicenter cohort study of 5122 critically ill adults with 
      COVID-19 admitted to 68 hospitals across the United States. To estimate the 
      effect of ECMO on mortality, we emulated a target trial of ECMO receipt versus no 
      ECMO receipt within 7 days of ICU admission among mechanically ventilated 
      patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100). Patients were followed 
      until hospital discharge, death, or a minimum of 60 days. We adjusted for 
      confounding using a multivariable Cox model. RESULTS: Among the 190 patients 
      treated with ECMO, the median age was 49 years (IQR 41-58), 137 (72.1%) were men, 
      and the median PaO(2)/FiO(2) prior to ECMO initiation was 72 (IQR 61-90). At 
      60 days, 63 patients (33.2%) had died, 94 (49.5%) were discharged, and 33 (17.4%) 
      remained hospitalized. Among the 1297 patients eligible for the target trial 
      emulation, 45 of the 130 (34.6%) who received ECMO died, and 553 of the 1167 
      (47.4%) who did not receive ECMO died. In the primary analysis, patients who 
      received ECMO had lower mortality than those who did not (HR 0.55; 95% CI 
      0.41-0.74). Results were similar in a secondary analysis limited to patients with 
      PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 80 (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.40-0.77). CONCLUSION: In select patients 
      with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19, ECMO may reduce mortality.
